Double digits were the norm back there. When I was a kid we lived under hyperinflation which is a complete shit show, people get their paychecks and immediately go buy their groceries for the month. This is not a figure of speech, they really did go IMMEDIATLY because the prices were readjusted 1 or 2 times IN THE SAME DAY. Concept of savings was non-existent. Either you buy as much US Dollars as possible or put in some asset that has intrinsic value like real estate. The house I grew up was huge, and I learned that was not because my father was in a good financial situation, but rather it was the only option to dump all his savings before it lose half of its value in matter of weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, my bar is a bit out of place here... so should I be concerned with the 6.2% rate? My take on this: likely FED will increase rates, which will devalue bonds and stock prices. But then this should be already embedded in the current asset prices, so I don&#39;t think I should be doing anything with my portfolio here.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qyjgng/is_the_inflation_trend_in_the_us_really_that_scary/","title":"Is the inflation trend in the US really that scary?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-21T03:00:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-21 03:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qyjgng","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qyjgng/is_the_inflation_trend_in_the_us_really_that_scary/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qyjgng/is_the_inflation_trend_in_the_us_really_that_scary/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Confident_Respect455","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Confident_Respect455","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Confident_Respect455","score":738,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アメリカのインフレ傾向はそんなに怖いものなのか？","the_new_excerpt":"米国の10月のインフレ率は年率6.2％と超高水準でした。\nこれは、最近の3％以下のインフレ率を考えると、非常に高い水準です。\n\nとはいえ、私の出身地では、インフレ率が6％になると、人々は大喜びしたものです。\n私の出身地では、インフレ率が6％になると人々は大喜びしました。2桁のインフレが当たり前だったのです。私が子供だった頃\n私が子供の頃、私たちは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国的通货膨胀趋势真的那么可怕吗？","the_new_excerpt":"美国10月份的通货膨胀率按年计算为6.2%，这是一个超高的数字。\n考虑到近期低于3%的利率的历史。\n\n也就是说，我来自一个地方，在那里，当他们得到6%的通货膨胀率时，人们会击掌相庆。\n6%的通胀率。双位数是那里的常态。当我还是个孩子的时候\n我们生活在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國的通貨膨脹趨勢真的那麼可怕嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"美國10月份的通貨膨脹率按年計算爲6.2%，這是一個超高的數字。\n考慮到近期低於3%的利率的歷史。\n\n也就是說，我來自一個地方，在那裏，當他們得到6%的通貨膨脹率時，人們會擊掌相慶。\n6%的通脹率。雙位數是那裏的常態。當我還是個孩子的時候\n我們生活在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qyhjq0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyhjq0/market_bubble_explained_for_dummies/","title":"Market bubble explained for dummies","date":"November 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ダミーのためのバブル解説","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"傻瓜式的市场泡沫解释","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"傻瓜式的市場泡沫解釋","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qy9nxu","excerpt":"SCION ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC\n\nHTTP://WWW.SCIONASSET.COM • SARATOGA, CA\n\n## SCION ASSET MANAGEMENT IS BASED OUT OF SARATOGA AND IS RUN BY DR.
