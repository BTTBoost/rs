While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.</p>\n\n<p>To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html</a></p>\n\n<p>So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.</p>\n\n<p>3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.</p>\n\n<p>Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed&#39;s &quot;operation twist&quot; might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]</p>\n\n<p>4) Also, while &quot;inflation expectations&quot; have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I&#39;m not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6w7uv/people_worried_about_the_10y_yield_going_out_of/","title":"People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T12:59:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 12:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e62f8ecf-993a-5665-9a08-24986ee29160","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6w7uv/people_worried_about_the_10y_yield_going_out_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6w7uv/people_worried_about_the_10y_yield_going_out_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"GabenFanClub","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GabenFanClub","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GabenFanClub","score":312,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"担心10y收益率失控的人应该认清一些事情。","the_new_excerpt":"在我看来\n\n1）收益率已经开始成为吸引国外主要买家的因素。\n日本机构是最大的国外买家，并且在持续增发。\n更多。\n\ninvesting.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise holdings-ofus-treasuries for second month in January-data...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"擔心10y收益率失控的人應該認清一些事情。","the_new_excerpt":"在我看來\n\n1）收益率已經開始成爲吸引國外主要買家的因素。\n日本機構是最大的國外買家，並且在持續增發。\n更多。\n\ninvesting.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise holdings-ofus-treasuries for second month in January-data...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-41321bf6-f229-5285-b41f-15c11dcd8463","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6prny/sorry_im_late_to_the_party_but_wsb_has_now/","title":"Sorry I'm late to the party, but WSB has now adopted a sloth","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"对不起，我迟到了，但WSB现在已经采用了一个树懒","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"對不起，我遲到了，但WSB現在已經採用了一個樹懶","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-3051cee3-73c6-583b-b872-e0de01f1010d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6x9l0/me_and_the_boys_now_that_stimmy_day_is_here/","title":"Me and the boys now that stimmy day is here","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我和孩子们的刺激日到了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我和孩子們的刺激日到了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-e62f8ecf-993a-5665-9a08-24986ee29160","previousId":"RedditPost-41321bf6-f229-5285-b41f-15c11dcd8463","nextId":"RedditPost-3051cee3-73c6-583b-b872-e0de01f1010d","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6w7uv/people_worried_about_the_10y_yield_going_out_of/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
