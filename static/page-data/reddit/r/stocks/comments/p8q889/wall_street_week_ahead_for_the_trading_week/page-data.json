I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 23rd, 2021.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep ‘taper talk’ going at Jackson Hole - <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/fed-officials-will-seek-to-avoid-a-tantrum-as-they-keep-taper-talk-going-at-jackson-hole.html\">(Source)</a></strong></h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Federal Reserve’s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The Fed chairman’s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“We’re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. “I don’t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don’t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Fed and markets</h1>\n\n<p>But the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>There could be some volatility around the Fed’s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“We just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,” he said. “For now, it’s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>As for Powell, “he’s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he’s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there’s a lot of it,” said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“The asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There’s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,” said Swonk. “They want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they’re not hitting the brakes. They’re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“To avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,” Swonk said. “If this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we’re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they’re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><strong>This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/sxTwppT.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/XaZ3OqE.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oLHqqFQ.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Futures Markets as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/iuH4ig1.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/lflLJO1.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7JLtvgO.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/cnmvI5A.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Cqw6DkJ.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/QeyCpqJ.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Here are the upcoming IPO&#39;s for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Friday&#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4izjE1a.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/k1m7sYO.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year</h1>\n\n<p>Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/40afab5bf8a7d5d83f5c0df66416bd63/64275cde73d35d0e-b1/s400x600/f24c1395359fa121818eb1387e2f2cde70364a83.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>In post-election years, September’s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>US Dollar Breaks Out</h1>\n\n<p>After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg&#39;s dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082021-Dollar-2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims</h1>\n\n<p>Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week&#39;s 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Initial-Jobless-Claims-Seasonal-1a.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week&#39;s reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-SA.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081921-Con-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Share.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss</h1>\n\n<p>Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB&#39;s record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August&#39;s 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1a.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week&#39;s Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan&#39;s Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today&#39;s reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-1b.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-3.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/081721-NAHB-2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1><strong>STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 20th, 2021</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())</strong></h6>\n\n<p>(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)</p>\n\n<h1><strong>STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.22.21</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())</strong></h6>\n\n<p>(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>(<strong>T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hV3LYS4.png\">CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/YupEtZ9.png\">CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK&#39;S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/bge25NW.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY&#39;S MARKET OPEN!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Monday 8.23.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eKNfaOS.png\">CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h1><strong><em>Monday 8.23.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Nsf4OKr.png\">CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Tuesday  8.24.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/xfr0NjU.png\">CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h1><strong><em>Tuesday 8.24.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/5Ly7VHw.png\">CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Wednesday 8.25.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/OFpxuOX.png\">CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h1><strong><em>Wednesday 8.25.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/8uM0FGq.png\">CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Thursday 8.26.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/drMyySB.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n\n<h1><strong><em>Thursday 8.26.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7Hr5nKX.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Friday 8.27.21 Before Market Open:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/RLkiAvx.png\">CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY&#39;S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!</a>)</h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1><strong><em>Friday 8.27.21 After Market Close:</em></strong></h1>\n\n<h6>([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY&#39;S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())</h6>\n\n<p>(NONE.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>JD.com, Inc. $63.62</h1>\n\n<p><strong>JD.com, Inc.
