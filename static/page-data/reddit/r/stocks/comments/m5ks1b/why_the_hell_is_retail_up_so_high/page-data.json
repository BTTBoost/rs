Here is the chart. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/a027rvQ\">https://imgur.com/a/a027rvQ</a> </p>\n\n<p>I can understand a rally leading into loosening of coronavirus restrictions and people going out and about. However, retail has been on a decline for years. You can see this ETF was trading in the 40s in 2016 and now its all the way up to mid 90s? Does anyone have a good explanation for this or are these companies way overvalued? </p>\n\n<p>The only thing I can think of to justify the valuations is that a ton of these retailers who were slowly losing for the last few years have been pushed to expedite their ecommerce transition during COVID so it is possible that these valuations are secondary to the retail market actually successfully pivoting.</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Gamestop.
