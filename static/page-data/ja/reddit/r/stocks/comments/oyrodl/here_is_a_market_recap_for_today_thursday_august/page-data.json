Tomorrow, the Department of Labor will release it’s July Unemployment Report. This report is set to be a wild card, with analyst estimates ranging wildly from ADP estimating an addition of 330,000 jobs to Bloomberg economists estimate of 845,000 jobs added. We’ll see tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>The three major indexes powered higher today, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recording fresh intraday all-time highs. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.75% higher and is marginally below it’s previous all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, closed 1.8% higher. </p>\n\n<p>ADP, a leading payroll and human services software company, released its July 2021 Employment Report, which estimated that private employers added only 330,000 jobs in July, less than half the 690,000 gain expected by economists. While ADP’s estimates aren’t 100% accurate, it sets up a negative backdrop for the July Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow. As I said earlier, estimates between economists range wildly, so we’ll just have to wait and see how the report unfolds. </p>\n\n<p>So far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85% year-on-year, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. </p>\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Weekly Unemployment Report came in roughly in-line with analyst expectations\n\n<ul>\n<li>First time jobless claims: 385,000 vs 383,000 expected</li>\n<li>Continuing Claims 2.93 million vs 3 million</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The rally in Robinhood (HOOD) stopped, with the stock dropping more than 27% today, very crazy movement in this stock the last few days. On the other hand, shares of “meme stocks” advanced after falling a few days in a row. </li>\n<li>Uber (UBER) posted a wider than expected loss for Q2. This bodes bad for the company since rival Lyft (LYFT) unexpectedly posted a profit last quarter.</li>\n<li>Shares of Etsy (ETSY) sank 10% after the company posted slightly disappointed during earnings. </li>\n<li>Shares of DataDog (DDOG) gapped up after the company smashed earnings estimates </li>\n<li>Penn National Gaming (PENN) acquired Score Media (SCR), the largest sports media app in Canada and the third largest in the US for $2 billion in cash and stock. Jay Snowden, President and CEO said of the acquisition, “theScore’s unique media platform and modern, state-of-the art technology is a powerful complement to the reach of Barstool Sports and its popular personalities and content. We are now uniquely positioned to seamlessly serve our customers with the most powerful ecosystem of sports, gaming and media in North America, ultimately creating a community that doesn’t currently exist.” I personally like this stock.</li>\n<li>In a White House event, the Biden administration and auto makers committed to try and get EV sales to make up 50% of cars sold in the US by 2030, contingent on the government support for the transition.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by Argus from $130 to $140 at Buy.
