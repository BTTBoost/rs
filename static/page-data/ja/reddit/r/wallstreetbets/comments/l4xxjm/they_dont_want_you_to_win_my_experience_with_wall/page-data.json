He is a senior senior senior executive with the firm. </p>\n\n<p>Im a working dude, I make like 40k a year if that. This guy has the amazing house with the ocean views, the yacht, the small plane, the holiday house - all of it.   </p>\n\n<p>When I was hanging out with him I really wanted to dig down into investing, as he has been doing it all his life and has been very successful at it.  It was an incredibly awkward conversation and he simply did not want to engage at all - and told me that investments should only be done by firms like his and that normal people like me should pay fees for firms like his to invest money. </p>\n\n<p>It started to click with me that there are thousands of fund managers just like him around the world shit scared that people like us take our own future into our own hands, and wont pay their fees. They are terrified that they are going to lose control of the game they have rigged against the working class for 50+ years.   </p>\n\n<p>You could see it today on CNBC - fund managers screaming and having tantrums that little guys that make an hourly wage could trade options and make a few months rent in a day. </p>\n\n<p>They are fucking terrified of this new generation that can trade with confidence from an app on their phone, and make decent money if they are willing to put some risk and time in learning into it.   </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t let these mother fuckers take your money, don&#39;t let the fear they have cloud your judgment. This  last 12 months has been a turning point for millions of people who bought stocks or options for the first time in their life, and realised its not as scary as they were told by &quot;the professionals&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>500 GME @ 70.21.
