Once amended, the rules would require firms structured using the so-called Variable Interest Entity model to seek approval before going public in Hong Kong or the U.S., the people said.  </p>\n\n<p>The proposed change is the first indication of how Beijing plans to implement a crackdown on overseas listings flagged by the country’s State Council on Tuesday. Closer oversight would plug a gap that’s been used for two decades by technology giants from <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BABA:US\">Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.</a> to <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/700:HK\">Tencent Holdings Ltd.</a> to attract foreign capital and list offshore, potentially thwarting the ambitions of firms like ByteDance Ltd. <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/bytedance-founder-zhang-yiming-steps-down-as-ceo-ahead-of-ipo\">contemplating</a> going public outside the mainland.  </p>\n\n<p>It would also threaten a lucrative line of business for Wall Street banks and add to concerns of a decoupling between China and the U.S. in sensitive areas like technology. Chinese firms have raised about $76 billion through first-time share sales in the U.S. over the past decade.  </p>\n\n<p>The changes are subject to approval by the State Council, the people said. The securities regulator plans to discuss potential revisions with firms that underwrite share sales, one of the people said. The CSRC didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. Bloomberg News <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/china-is-said-to-mull-tighter-rules-for-firms-listing-overseas\">reported</a> on the potential tightening in May.  </p>\n\n<p>Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 initial public offering, the <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/quicktake/chinas-fraught-ipos\">VIE framework</a> has never been formally endorsed by Beijing. It has nevertheless enabled Chinese companies to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment in sensitive sectors including the Internet industry. The structure allows a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity -- registered in places like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.  </p>\n\n<p>While virtually every major Chinese internet company has used the structure, it’s become increasingly worrisome for Beijing as it tightens its grip on technology firms that have infiltrated every corner of Chinese life and control reams of consumer data. Authorities so far have little legal recourse to prevent sensitive overseas listings, as with the recent <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DIDI:US\">Didi Global Inc.</a> IPO, which went ahead despite requests for a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/china-s-cyber-watchdog-asked-didi-to-delay-ipo-on-data-concerns\">delay</a> from regulators.  </p>\n\n<p>The additional oversight could bestow a level of legitimacy on the VIE structure that’s been a perennial worry for global investors given the shaky legal ground on which it stands.  </p>\n\n<p>China’s heightened regulatory scrutiny is echoed by tightening in the U.S. Recent <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/trump-signs-bill-that-could-remove-china-stock-listings-in-u-s\">legislation</a> requires companies listed on U.S. bourses to allow inspectors to review their financial audits. China has long resisted letting the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examine audits of firms whose shares trade in America, citing national security interests.  </p>\n\n<p>The State Council <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/china-vows-to-ramp-up-scrutiny-of-data-at-listed-companies\">said</a> Tuesday that rules for overseas listings will be revised while publicly-traded firms will be held accountable for keeping their data secure. China will also step up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets, it said.  </p>\n\n<p>Under the revised rules, VIEs like Alibaba that have already gone public may need approval for additional share offerings in the offshore market, according to the people familiar.  </p>\n\n<p>The “political compromise” that allowed the VIE structure as a way around foreign ownership restrictions is “under serious threat,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, following the State Council’s statement. China “can now discourage its promising firms from listing abroad, which could boost its ambitions to develop financial markets on the mainland.”  </p>\n\n<p>One firm has already suspended its work helping two Chinese companies using the VIE structure to list overseas after being advised by regulatory officials that new rules are being put in place, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  </p>\n\n<p>In recent days, China has intensified its crackdown on technology firms with the cyberspace regulator announcing a probe into Didi and pulling the company’s app from stores. Shares in Didi, which controls almost the entire ride-hailing market in China, plunged 20% in U.S. trading just days after a $4.4 billion IPO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/","title":"China Considers Closing Loophole Used by Tech Giants for U.S. IPOs (Article in comments)","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-07T13:31:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-07 13:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"37cbc297-4038-5aef-8584-278be3280d14","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Looddak","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Looddak","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Looddak","score":583,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"中国、ハイテク企業が米国でIPOする際の抜け道を塞ぐことを検討 (コメント欄の記事)","the_new_excerpt":"アーカイブ\n[https://archive.ph/2021.07.07-075355/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/china-mulls-closing-loophole-used-by-tech-giants-for-u-s-ipos]\n\n> 北京の規制当局は、中国の携帯電話会社をブロックするためのルール変更を計画しています。\n> 中国企業の海外上場を阻止することが可能になる。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"中国考虑堵住科技巨头在美国上市时使用的漏洞 (文章有评论)","the_new_excerpt":"档案\n[https://archive.ph/2021.07.07-075355/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/china-mulls-closing-loophole-used-by-tech-giants-for-u-s-ipos]\n\n> 北京的监管机构正在计划修改规则，允许他们阻止\n> 中国公司在海外上市，即使该单位...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中國考慮堵住科技巨頭在美國上市時使用的漏洞 (文章有評論)","the_new_excerpt":"檔案\n[https://archive.ph/2021.07.07-075355/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/china-mulls-closing-loophole-used-by-tech-giants-for-u-s-ipos]\n\n> 北京的監管機構正在計劃修改規則，允許他們阻止\n> 中國公司在海外上市，即使該單位...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-66097772-6f8c-5cd7-a150-de94edc6dfee","excerpt":"Put my 57,000 in Savings, place all in Vanguard SP500?\n\nI have been placing about 2,000 a month into Vanguard.
