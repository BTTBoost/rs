It seems like they want every IG account totally public and not simply for people who want to browse IG anonymously. </p>\n\n<p>It directly says: &quot;The video will never be visible on Instagram and will be deleted within 30 days. This won&#39;t use ice recognition or collect biometric data&quot;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qt15br/this_is_just_creepy/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qt15br/this_is_just_creepy/</a></p>\n\n<p>But given the new &quot;Meta&quot; name so focused on the meta verse, it&#39;s extremely difficult to trust they aren&#39;t using biometric data. </p>\n\n<p>Captchas and &quot;image puzzles&quot; have been used for years to confirm human users and reduce bot activity, and are far less intrusive.</p>\n\n<p>The level of privacy is getting insane at this point and I just wonder where this is leading to for Meta. They say the data will be deleted within 30 days.. but I just don&#39;t believe that and they are using it for some future Metaverse data. </p>\n\n<p>I frankly wish this was a bigger news story already, because if they actually got backlash I think they would have to at least respond about it. Very interesting that I suddenly started getting these messages too around the same time Meta was announced as the name.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qv20ol/meta_using_facial_recognition_video_selfies_for/","title":"Meta using facial recognition \"Video selfies\" for \"suspicious accounts\".","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-16T22:18:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-16 22:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qv20ol","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qv20ol/meta_using_facial_recognition_video_selfies_for/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qv20ol/meta_using_facial_recognition_video_selfies_for/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"BigBet0","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigBet0","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BigBet0","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qvbkwn","excerpt":"The net cumulative premiums on GME keep increasing, suggesting that a large\namount of calls is being accumulated.
