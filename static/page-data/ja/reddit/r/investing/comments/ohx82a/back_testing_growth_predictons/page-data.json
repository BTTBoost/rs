The process was to look at old financials and come up with my judgement.  I have never analyzed $GIL before and I knew nothing about their financial state past or present. I read their annual reports in order from oldest to newest in order to maintain an unbiased opinion.</p>\n\n<p>I know that some of you will point out that I could have just said that I did this in order to make me look smart by having accurate growth estimates.  I assure you that the point of this post is to highlight the discrepancies between predictions and reality, and hopefully add something to your investing toolbox for you to think about.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ten years ago analysis:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(2011)</strong> The balance sheet has a good structure.  Current assets along can cover all liabilities quite easily.  Debts are not a problem.  There has been recent sales and earnings with good profit margins hovering around 10%.  Operating cash flow is generating consistent cash flow.  Net cash flow was negative attributable to a large business acquisition so this year net cash flow was negative but on average could be expected to reach 100M annually.</p>\n\n<p>Acquisitions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The business they acquired was a sock supplier for 350M at a net asset premium of 137M.</li>\n<li>They also spent 15M on 12M assets on a vertically integrated T-Shirt manufacturing facility in Bangladesh.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Inventories are mostly finished goods (About 80% are finished goods) with the remainder being materials, spare parts, and partially finished goods.  Manufacturing equipment is about half of PPE and increased by 100M in the last year.  Goodwill increased by roughly the value excess of assets in the acquisitions.  They have an 800M RLOC with 209M drawn @ 2.3%.</p>\n\n<p>Based on their past income statement data, I would not say it is unreasonable to expect 100M in revenue growth per year over the next five years.  They have increased sales by 300M per year, but to stay conservative I will use the figure of 100M YoY or about 5%. Earnings and OCF will follow this trend.  The balance sheet will stay strong, hopefully with the same structure of assets as we see now. Depending on their appetite, debt may increase if they keep up with large acquisitions.</p>\n\n<p>What actually happened:</p>\n\n<p>2016:</p>\n\n<p>-Current assets went up about 500M, or about 60%.  Overall assets increased by 1B</p>\n\n<p>- Liabilities doubled, Retained earnings increased by about 50%</p>\n\n<p>- Sales increased by about 1.3B, or 250M per year. Overall increase of about 12% yearly</p>\n\n<p>- Earnings increased by about 4% yearly.  OCF increased by about 50%, or 8% YoY.</p>\n\n<p>Their financial health got stronger overall.  Sales and OCF did much better than expected, and earnings slightly underperformed.  The operating environments during this period were quite good.  The world economy was experiencing growth after the financial meltdown in 2008 that was above average.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Five years ago analysis:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(2016)</strong> The balance sheet has good structure.  Current assets are almost double liabilities.  Most current assets are inventory. Assuming that of these only finished products will be converted into cash and receivables nets 640M, which still covers all liabilities.  The company is on track to have almost no need for debt.  Sales are large compared to the balance sheet, and profit margins are and have been above 10%.  OCF is good, but ideally this number would be about 20% larger to cover current asset requirements with a larger debt coverage margin of safety.</p>\n\n<p>They recently acquired a shirt manufacturer for 112M with 14M goodwill.  They also paid 102M for the assets + 26M goodwill in a lingerie company, the first acquisition of this sort.</p>\n\n<p>It would be reasonable to say that revenue can grow by about 250M per year or about 8% YoY. This is about half of the growth seen in the recent two years, so it is considered a conservative estimate.  Net income will likely trail this trend by 20-30% earnings growth has been slightly slower than revenue growth.  Earnings growth can be estimated to be 4-5% YoY, and OCF could follow this closely.  If they manage money right, total liabilities could shrink to ⅓ of total assets in the coming years, although debt may rise as a number if they continue their current acquisition habits.</p>\n\n<p>What actually happened:</p>\n\n<p>2021:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sales are at 2B, about a 35% decrease from 2016</li>\n<li>Net income is -220M</li>\n<li>Operating cash flow have decreased by 40%</li>\n<li>All three of my predicted growth rates were useless.  Revenue from 2019 year end was also much lower than the growth rates would have dictated.</li>\n<li>Instead of selling more shears, they issued one billion in debt payable over the next six years with an average interest rate of 2.8%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is clear that in periods of stable growth, it is much easier to be optimistic. Who would have been able to predict the pandemic? Certainly not me.  But that is not an excuse for being wrong.  This was a very interesting activity for me to do, and hopefully this can serve as a reminder that predictions and reality can very possibly have zero correlation.  The low growth in 2019 was not related to the pandemic, further proving that predictions - your own or from others or even professionals - have the possibility of being dangerously wrong.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR:I tried to look at really old financials and predict what would happen in the companies near future.  It worked well from 2011-2016, but completely failed between 2016-2021.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ohx82a/back_testing_growth_predictons/","title":"Back testing growth predictons","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-12T01:52:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-12 01:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"79792471-0863-5b0b-9ae6-41bc4071105c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ohx82a/back_testing_growth_predictons/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ohx82a/back_testing_growth_predictons/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"valuescott","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/valuescott","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"valuescott","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"成長予測のバックテスト","the_new_excerpt":"下部のTLDR\n\n私はバックテストの実験をすることにしました。\n定量的、定性的な要因を考慮して、ある企業（$GIL: Gildan）の現在と最近のオペレーションを見て\n定量的、定性的な要因を考慮して、自分なりの5年間の成長予測を立てるというバックテストをやってみることにした。\nその過程で、昔の財務状況を見て、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"回测增长预测","the_new_excerpt":"底部的TLDR\n\n我决定尝试一个回测实验，我将查看一家公司（$GIL: Gildan）当前和最近的运营情况，并提出我自己的五年计划。\n观察一家公司（$GIL: Gildan）的当前和近期运营情况，并根据我自己的五年\n增长的估计，并考虑到定量和定性的因素。\n这个过程是看旧的财务数据和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"回測增長預測","the_new_excerpt":"底部的TLDR\n\n我決定嘗試一個回測實驗，我將查看一家公司（$GIL: Gildan）當前和最近的運營情況，並提出我自己的五年計劃。\n觀察一家公司（$GIL: Gildan）的當前和近期運營情況，並根據我自己的五年\n增長的估計，並考慮到定量和定性的因素。\n這個過程是看舊的財務數據和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9647d487-d64e-5f6c-9ac0-58396b9d23f9","excerpt":"I wrote my final paper in my Advanced Investments class last semester on\nBridgewater’s all-weather portfolio and, more specifically, their risk parity\napproach within that portfolio, and it was very fascinating to study this\ninnovative strategy that so uniquely distinguished legendary investor Ray…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oi8rp2/can_risk_parity_work_as_an_investment_strategy/","title":"Can risk parity work as an investment strategy with near-zero interest rates?","date":"July 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゼロに近い金利の中で、リスクパリティは投資戦略として機能するのか？","the_new_excerpt":"私は前学期、上級投資のクラスで最終論文を書きました。\nブリッジウォーターのオールウェザー・ポートフォリオとその中のリスク・パリティ・アプローチについて最終論文を書きました。\nこの革新的な戦略を研究することは非常に魅力的であった。\nこの革新的な戦略を研究することは非常に興味深く、伝説的な投資家であるレイ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在利率接近零的情况下，风险平价能否作为一种投资策略发挥作用？","the_new_excerpt":"上学期我在高级投资课上写的期末论文是关于\n桥水公司的全天候投资组合，更具体地说，他们在该组合中的风险平价方法\n他们在该投资组合中的风险平价方法，研究这一创新策略非常吸引人。\n研究这种创新的策略是非常吸引人的，它使传奇的投资者雷...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在利率接近零的情況下，風險平價能否作爲一種投資策略發揮作用？","the_new_excerpt":"上學期我在高級投資課上寫的期末論文是關於\n橋水公司的全天候投資組合，更具體地說，他們在該組合中的風險平價方法\n他們在該投資組合中的風險平價方法，研究這一創新策略非常吸引人。\n研究這種創新的策略是非常吸引人的，它使傳奇的投資者雷...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1414404335442841602","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1414404335442841602","title":"https://t.co/AVlueTYS8a","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 12, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"https://t.co/AVlueTYS8a","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"https://t.co/AVlueTYS8a","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"https://t.co/AVlueTYS8a","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-79792471-0863-5b0b-9ae6-41bc4071105c","previousId":"RedditPost-9647d487-d64e-5f6c-9ac0-58396b9d23f9","nextId":"TweetPost-1414404335442841602","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ohx82a/back_testing_growth_predictons/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
