Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since February and below the 0.3% rise in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI has decreased to 4% from 4.3% in July, an encouraging sign. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI gaining 0.3% and the overall CPI rising 0.4%. It may not seem like it but this is a large month-to-month change.\nThe Fed&#39;s preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% inflation target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. August&#39;s data will be published later this month.\nThe CPI report comes at a time when the market’s attention is firmly focused on when the Fed will announce it will start scaling back pandemic-era quantitative easing. Powell has offered no signal beyond saying it “could be this year.” Other members of the Fed have been more hawkish in their stance. As I have reiterated more times than I can count, I remain unconcerned with tapering talks (see the 2013 Taper Tantrum). I remain bullish until the Fed begins considering interest rate hikes, at which time I will reassess.\nIn positive news, there are signs that the wave of coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US may be cresting. The seven-day average of daily Covid cases is about 144,300 as of Sept. 12, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That figure is down 12% over the past week and 14% from the most recent peak in case counts on Sept. 1, when the country was reporting an average of roughly 167,600 cases per day. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University said, This is good news.</p>\n\n<p>It could represent that we have reached a peak and we are now on the way down.” As of Sept 12, 54.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 63.8% have received at least one dose of either Pfizer (PFE) or Moderna (MRNA).\nHighlights\n- Yesterday, according to a report by the Financial Times, the CCP intends to break up Alipay, the financial super-app owned by Jack Ma’s Ant Group that has more than $1 billion users, and force the creation of a new entity for the company’s lending unit. The plan will also see Ant turn over user data that underpins its data decision to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79\">https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79</a>\n- Boeing (BA) raised long-0term demand forecasts today, signaling the company expects a snapback in commercial air travel once coronavirus Delta variant fears temper.\n- Microsoft (MSFT) outperformed after Morgan Stanley released a report saying it was expecting a 10% dividend hike.\n- China, the world&#39;s biggest vehicle market where regulators are implementing new rules on data protection, is developing machines that will be able to track data sent abroad by cars, a government-backed agency said on Tuesday.\n- Last week, a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apple’s 15-30% commission. This is massive for companies that make a lot of their revenue through the app store.\n- A cyber surveillance company based in Israel has developed a tool than can break into Apple iPhones with a never-before-seen technique for at least six months, internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday. The discovery is important because of the critical nature of the vulnerability, which affects all versions of Apple&#39;s iOS, OSX, and watchOS. Apple confirmed the vulnerability and said the issue has been fixed in today’s software update.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ViacomCBS (VIAC) will be restructuring Paramount Pictures amid a broader management shake-up, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.
