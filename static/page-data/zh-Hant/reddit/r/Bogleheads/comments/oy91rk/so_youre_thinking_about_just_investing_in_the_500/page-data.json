Now that global funds are available with thousands of stocks at similarly low costs that legacy reasoning is moot. To put it more directly: if you want to diversify, why would you stop at 50 or 500 stocks when you could own so many more?</p>\n\n<p>2) A lot of people say it&#39;s &#39;diversified enough&#39; but that sets of red flags of its own. The US has unique economic, political, cultural risks - take the Fed, which is holding down rates and arguably inflating stock valuations. Sure, it probably has some impact globally, but it has an outsize impact at home. Add to that the fact that small cap and international stocks (emerging in particular) add real diversification benefits to a US-only portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>3) A lot of people (consciously or not) are anchored on recent returns. Setting aside a huge wave of small cap value catching back up to large cap growth recently, winners rotate.</p>\n\n<p>4) And then there are the appeals to authority. It&#39;s <em>so easy</em> to fall into the trap of &#39;well it was good enough for Bogle and Buffett&#39; (two guys whose generation benefited massively from unusually high US outperformance). But two old dudes (bless them both, they&#39;re good guys) are not the end-all, be-all for creating a portfolio. Also, they have/had so much money the US could crash and burn and they&#39;d still have come out fine - they&#39;re not ordinary investors and I have a hard time believing the advice of billionaires applies to the rest of us.</p>\n\n<p>5) &#39;But the US is globally diversified already!&#39; This one always stumps my brain, because on the one hand, sure, US companies do tons of international business, but (a) international businesses do tons of business with the US too, so that cuts both ways, and (b) that factoid doesn&#39;t account for huge, long-term divergences between actual US and international stocks (which have actually grown <em>larger</em> not smaller over recent years!).</p>\n\n<p>It sure seems like a lot of people want to justify chasing recent hot winner, and unfortunately they have a lot of simplified material to draw on - old guys who are a bit out of touch but have the patina of investing geniuses, the fact that the US did do well this past decade (ignoring of course the decade before when it did horribly), and probably some subtle nationalism baked in too, at least for some people convinced of US exceptionalism. But here&#39;s the reality: markets reward risk. If the US is safer, it should have <em>lower</em> expected returns. So if you want safer, I can&#39;t fault you for sticking to the US, but if you want long-term diversified growth, consider branching out.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve probably missed some reasons along the way - I&#39;m mainly responding to the most common arguments I&#39;ve read recently. Note: I keep thinking I should unpin the post I made ages ago about recency bias and the US, but the fact that we regularly get <em>new</em> posts asking about US/large/growth tilts make me think it&#39;s still useful to have that up top.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/oy91rk/so_youre_thinking_about_just_investing_in_the_500/","title":"So you're thinking about just investing in the 500 index ...","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-05T09:56:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-05 09:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d4304208-6126-5299-bf23-cbfb7c033694","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/oy91rk/so_youre_thinking_about_just_investing_in_the_500/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/oy91rk/so_youre_thinking_about_just_investing_in_the_500/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"misnamed","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/misnamed","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"misnamed","score":138,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"500のインデックスにだけ投資しようと考えているわけですが．","the_new_excerpt":"...それ以上の分散投資をすべき理由をご紹介します。\n\n1) 500インデックスは、何十年もの間、唯一入手可能で安価なインデックスファンドであったため、ある種のレガシーな魅力があります。\n500インデックスは、何十年もの間、唯一入手可能で安価なインデックスファンドだったからです。\nそれが良いというわけではなく、ファンドマネージャーにとって、より小さなインデックスを追跡する方が簡単だったのです。今では、グローバルファンドは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"所以你在考虑只投资于500指数...","the_new_excerpt":"......这里有一些你应该分散投资的理由，超出这个范围。\n\n1）500指数有一种传统的吸引力，因为几十年来它是唯一的\n的指数基金--这并不意味着它更好，它只是\n这并不意味着它更好，只是对基金经理来说，跟踪一个较小的指数更容易。现在，全球基金...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"所以你在考慮只投資於500指數...","the_new_excerpt":"......這裏有一些你應該分散投資的理由，超出這個範圍。\n\n1）500指數有一種傳統的吸引力，因爲幾十年來它是唯一的\n的指數基金--這並不意味着它更好，它只是\n這並不意味着它更好，只是對基金經理來說，跟蹤一個較小的指數更容易。現在，全球基金...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-86cdd960-5b1d-5bc8-b529-d7609bbdf7c6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oy09hf/low_effort_hood_meme/","title":"low effort $hood meme","date":"August 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ローエフォート $hood meme","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"不费吹灰之力就能成名的备忘录","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不費吹灰之力就能成名的備忘錄","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-72529952-1c83-53ae-b5f2-8e12aedb8380","excerpt":"-Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) plummets over 19% in after hours trading following the\ncompany's downside third-quarter and full-year guidance due to the widespread\noutage in June.\n\n-Revenue in the second quarter was up 14% year-over-year to $85.02M, coming in\nabout $1M below consensus.
