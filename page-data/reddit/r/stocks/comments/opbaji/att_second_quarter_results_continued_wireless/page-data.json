Mobility delivered  strong service revenue, EBITDA and postpaid phone growth. Our fiber  business, which leads on customer satisfaction, grew subscribers and  penetration. HBO Max had another strong quarter and is ahead of plan to  be a leading direct-to-consumer streaming platform, with both  subscriber- and ad-supported choices. As a result, we’re raising our  global HBO Max year-end forecast to 70 million to 73 million  subscribers. Also, we’re updating full-year guidance for consolidated  revenue, wireless service revenue, adjusted EPS and free cash flow.”  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Second-Quarter Highlights</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Communications</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>•Mobility:  </p>\n\n<p>◦789,000 postpaid phone net adds  </p>\n\n<p>◦1,156,000 postpaid net adds  </p>\n\n<p>◦174,000 prepaid phone net adds  </p>\n\n<p>◦Postpaid phone churn of 0.69%, equaling lowest churn ever  </p>\n\n<p>◦Revenues up 10.4%; service revenues up 5.0%; equipment revenues up 31.9%  </p>\n\n<p>◦Operating income of $6.0 billion, up 3.4% year over year; EBITDA4 up 2.7%  </p>\n\n<p>◦Operating income margin of 31.7%; EBITDA service margin5 55.9%  </p>\n\n<p>•Consumer Wireline:  </p>\n\n<p>◦246,000 AT&amp;T Fiber net adds; penetration more than 36%  </p>\n\n<p>◦Revenues up 2.9%; broadband revenues up 8.3% with ARPU growth of 6.1%  </p>\n\n<p><strong>WarnerMedia</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>•2.8 million total domestic HBO Max and HBO subscriber6 net adds; total domestic subscribers of 47.0 million, up 10.7 million in past year; and 67.5 million7 globally, up  12.0 million in past year  </p>\n\n<p>•Launched ad-supported HBO Max and international offerings  </p>\n\n<p>•Domestic HBO Max and HBO ARPU8 of $11.90  </p>\n\n<p>•Direct-to-Consumer subscription revenues up nearly 40%  </p>\n\n<p>•Now expect 70-73 million global HBO Max/HBO subscribers by end of year</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>2021 Outlook</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The  company has updated its 2021 guidance. On a comparative basis  (excluding the impact of the DIRECTV/TPG transaction), the company now  expects:   </p>\n\n<p>•Consolidated revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range  </p>\n\n<p>•Adjusted EPS11 to grow in the low- to mid-single digits  </p>\n\n<p>•Gross capital investment in the $22 billion range, with capital expenditures in the $17 billion range  </p>\n\n<p>•Free cash flow in the $27 billion range, with a full-year total dividend payout ratio in the high 50’s% range.   </p>\n\n<p>The  company expects the DIRECTV/TPG transaction to close in the next few  weeks, which will impact certain aspects of guidance. Assuming that time  frame, the expected impact of the deal on the remainder of 2021 is:  </p>\n\n<p>•Revenues to be lower by $9 billion  </p>\n\n<p>•EBITDA to be lower by $1 billion  </p>\n\n<p>•Free cash flow to be lower by about $1 billion, equating to $26 billion for the year  </p>\n\n<p>No change is expected to updated adjusted EPS and capital investment guidance. The company also expects adjusted equity income  from $1.0 to $1.2 billion for the last 5 months of 2021 as a result of  its 70% ownership of the new DIRECTV entity and reimbursements from  transition services agreements.  </p>\n\n<p>The  company expects proceeds of about $7.8 billion at close of the  transaction, and annual cash distributions of more than $1 billion.  </p>\n\n<p>Post-close,  the cash generated by DIRECTV will be used, among other things, for  DIRECTV’s capital expenditures and working capital needs, debt financing  obligations, cash coupon on TPG senior preferred, and tax distributions  to AT&amp;T and TPG. Excess cash will be used for debt repayment and  dividend distributions.  </p>\n\n<p>The post-close dividend distribution waterfall is as follows:  </p>\n\n<p>1.TPG senior preferred equity ($1.8 billion)  </p>\n\n<p>2.AT&amp;T junior preferred equity ($4.25 billion + accrued payment-in-kind)  </p>\n\n<p>3.AT&amp;T common catch-up equity ($4.2 billion)  </p>\n\n<p>4.Remaining dividends split 70/30 to AT&amp;T/TPG  </p>\n\n<p>5.Proceeds from any future exit flow through the capital structure, including debt and dividend distribution waterfall </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Have a nice day</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/opbaji/att_second_quarter_results_continued_wireless/","title":"AT&T second quarter results: \"Continued wireless, fiber and HBO Max subscriber gains and strong cash flows\"","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-22T18:04:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-22 18:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"65ccb1ec-7d2a-5823-9db6-05386bc5890c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/opbaji/att_second_quarter_results_continued_wireless/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/opbaji/att_second_quarter_results_continued_wireless/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"MathematicianWide339","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MathematicianWide339","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MathematicianWide339","score":61,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AT&Tの第2四半期決算。\"ワイヤレス、ファイバー、HBO Maxの継続的な加入者獲得と強力なキャッシュフロー\"","the_new_excerpt":"プレスリリースに掲載されている内容を勝手にコピーしています...\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000732717/000073271721000060/t-20210722.htm\n\n\n\n> 第2四半期連結業績\n> \n> 連結売上高は、7.6％増の440億米ドルとなりました。\n> \n> 希薄化後1株当たり利益は、前年同期の0.17ドルに対し、0.21ドル。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"AT&T第二季度业绩。\"持续的无线、光纤和HBO Max用户收益和强劲的现金流\"","the_new_excerpt":"我随意地从新闻发布的文件中复制......\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000732717/000073271721000060/t-20210722.htm\n\n\n\n> 第二季度综合业绩\n> \n> -综合收入为440亿美元，增长7.6%。\n> \n> -稀释后的每股收益为0.21美元，而去年同期为0.17美元。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AT&T第二季度業績。\"持續的無線、光纖和HBO Max用戶收益和強勁的現金流\"","the_new_excerpt":"我隨意地從新聞發佈的文件中複製......\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000732717/000073271721000060/t-20210722.htm\n\n\n\n> 第二季度綜合業績\n> \n> -綜合收入爲440億美元，增長7.6%。\n> \n> -稀釋後的每股收益爲0.21美元，而去年同期爲0.17美元。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1418246101535186951","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1418246101535186951","title":"30,000 SITES ARE DOWN WORLDWIDE *","date":"July 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"全世界で30,000サイトがダウンしています。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"全球有3万个网站瘫痪 *","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"全球有3萬個網站癱瘓 *","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a11b9f21-3d11-5365-b3c2-06a4756636e1","excerpt":"AvePoint (ticker: AVPT), the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions\nProvider was just listed publicly on Nasdaq last week.\n\n// About AvePoint\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft\ncloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices.
