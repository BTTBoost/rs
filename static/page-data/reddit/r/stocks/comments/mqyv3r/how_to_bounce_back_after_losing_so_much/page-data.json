I slowly grew my portfolio to around 8,000$ and had $1000 cash saved up. I had a strategy of dividend stock investing with some growth stocks in there. </p>\n\n<p>Fast foward to Jan 2021 and I was addicted to the stockmarket. My friend told me to learn about options and debit spreads and all that good stuff. I started making a ton of money with options (because of state of the market before mid-febuary). I grew my portfolio to around 15,000. I had no guidance I was just learning as I went. </p>\n\n<p>Well, since I did not realize the downside of options, I was heavily leveraged in options so my portfolio over the last month has basically evaporated. Im down to 4,000 dollars now, and I know I should just construct a good portfolio with risk taken into consideration, but at this point, I feel so set back that I am discouraged to just live my life with some safe stocks and continue to add money over time. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, every time I think about the money I’ve lost it makes me discouraged in investing in big cap stocks that will make me 5-20% because I will still be far behind compared to where I was before. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about the money I’ve lost and wished I had someone to tell me to take some profits when I was doing so well. I did learn a lot from losing all this money, but I have so little now that I feel like it doesn’t even matter. </p>\n\n<p>Also I know the amount of money is peanuts to many, but I am just a college student and wanted to use the money I made in the market to invest in real estate, and now I feel like that goal is 10x farther than it was in Feb. </p>\n\n<p>Any advice would be very appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mqyv3r/how_to_bounce_back_after_losing_so_much/","title":"How to bounce back after losing so much?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-14T21:52:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-14 21:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b9bb348b-16fc-5a9c-8872-e8cb90976b70","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mqyv3r/how_to_bounce_back_after_losing_so_much/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mqyv3r/how_to_bounce_back_after_losing_so_much/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"therealnumberIX","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/therealnumberIX","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"therealnumberIX","score":257,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"多くのものを失った後、どうやって立ち直るか？","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、ここが適切なサブページかどうかわかりませんが、アドバイスをお願いします。\n\n私は現在21歳で、昨年の暴落時に投資を始めました。I\n徐々にポートフォリオを8,000ドル程度まで増やし、1,000ドルの現金を貯めました。私の投資戦略は\n成長株を含めた配当株投資の戦略を持っていました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"失去了这么多，如何反弹？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们，不知道这是不是合适的子，但我需要一些建议。\n\n我目前21岁，去年股灾期间开始投资。I\n慢慢地，我的投资组合增长到8000元左右，并有1000元现金储蓄。我有一个\n红利股投资的策略与一些成长股...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"失去了這麼多，如何反彈？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們，不知道這是不是合適的子，但我需要一些建議。\n\n我目前21歲，去年股災期間開始投資。I\n慢慢地，我的投資組合增長到8000元左右，並有1000元現金儲蓄。我有一個\n紅利股投資的策略與一些成長股...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5f96324f-68c2-572f-921f-94af5b75eab0","excerpt":"(IT guy views):\n\nMaybe, I don't have the full picture but it seems their products are only \"put a\ncool UI and automate some data tasks\".\n\nAll the things I saw in their presentation are perfectly manageable if you hire\nproper IT people.
