The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) opened at a new all-time high but was unable to hold onto the gains throughout the day and finished modestly lower while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell roughly 0.6%. Each of the major indexes had jumped to fresh record closing highs on Friday, propelled by the June jobs report that showed a healthy pace of recovery in the labor market but that did not suggest an overheating economy. </p>\n\n<p>Last week,  the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Change in non-farm payrolls:</strong> 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May</li>\n<li><strong>Unemployment rate:</strong> 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May </li>\n<li><strong>Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:</strong> 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May</li>\n<li><strong>Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:</strong> 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Oil prices turned lower after recently climbing to a multi-year high amid a breakdown in discussion between the two largest members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a gridlock over production cuts. The meeting, whose purpose was to increase output given an increase in demand for energy, yielded no decision. In response, Saudi Arabia raised the August official selling prices of all crude oil it sells to Asia, according to the state’s oil producer Aramco. </p>\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin said, “As negotiations continue, we estimate that most outcomes still implies higher prices in the coming months as the physical market tightens and with higher OPEC production that the group discussed needed by the global oil market next year. Price volatility will likely rise.”</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the release of the Federal Open Market Committee&#39;s June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed), which will help reveal central bankers&#39; thoughts around adjusting monetary policy as the economic recovery matures. The June meeting had marked a notable shift in the Fed&#39;s outlook, with the central bank signaling as many as two rate hikes by 2023. Subsequent public remarks revealed a number of committee members were also warming to the idea of a sooner-rather-than-later move to taper the Fed&#39;s crisis-era asset purchase program. In my opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the Fed will signal any acceleration in the timeline regarding interest rates but will not be surprised if more members discussed tapering quantitative easing in the coming months. </p>\n\n<p>Next week, earnings season for the Q2 kicks off, with big banks scheduled to report first. Earnings are expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-laden consumers that are finally emerging from lockdown  thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS&#39;s Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be &quot;need to be revised higher.&quot; This would mark the fastest pace of earnings growth since Q4 of 2009. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft’s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete. AMZN stock rocketed up roughly 5% on the news. </li>\n<li>Grubhub announced it plans to roll out food-delivering robots across US college campuses starting this fall. Seen a lot of reports about the growing influence of automation in deliveries. Recently, Dominos Pizza also announced it was rolling out an automated delivery robot. </li>\n<li>Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to “security concerns”. Shares were down roughly 19%. </li>\n<li>The Chairman of Weibo, which is basically like the Twitter of China, and a state investor are reportedly in talks to take the company private in a deal worth $20 billion and help facilitate the exit of major shareholder Alibaba (BABA). A lot of news coming out of China regarding big technology companies. </li>\n<li>Ford Motor (F), which has probably been hurt the worst by the recent chip-shortage, said it only has 162,100 trucks and cars in dealer inventories, half what it was three months ago and roughly one-quarter the stock the company usually has. </li>\n<li><strong>Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) target raised by JP Morgan from $165 to $170 at Overweight.
