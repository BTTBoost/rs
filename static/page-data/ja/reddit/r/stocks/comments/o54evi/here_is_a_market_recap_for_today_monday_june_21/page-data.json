If you were wondering where the Daily Market has been the last two weeks, I have had a great few months in the market and decided, now that I am fully vaccinated and the US is reopening, to go on vacation to New York (I live in California). I am now back home and ready to get back to the regular schedule! The Recap will be posted every day again from now on.</em></p>\n\n<p>Stocks jumped today, with the three major indexes rising, looking to recover the losses after the volatility experienced last week after the Federal Reserve’s outlook was announced. If anything, last week’s volatility shows us that the game of tug-of-war between inflationary pressures spooking investors and the Federal Reserve reiterating it will maintain accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future continues. As I have said in the past, while I acknowledge the risk posed by the elevated inflation readings, I too believe any pressure is transitory and remain extremely bullish moving forward. </p>\n\n<p>The Federal Reserve in the United States has a dual mandate: maintaining inflation stable and maximum employment. In light of the pandemic and surge in unemployment following lockdown, its maximum employment mandate has broadened. The measures and tools for achieving these mandates differ and have also changed recently. On the upside, the Fed now has additional flexibility in providing and maintaining accommodative monetary policies, namely near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, to support the economy. The downside is that as the economy continues to improve, policies may stay loose for too long, leading to inflation and forcing the Fed to respond by aggressively raising interest rates, which would pretty much tank equities. In my view, this is the fundamental risk hanging over the market moving forward: Is the Fed misinterpreting inflationary readings as transitory? In my view, they are not. </p>\n\n<p>Last week, the spotlight was squarely on the Federal Reserve meeting, with market participants anxious to see how the Fed interprets and plans to react to the higher-than-expected inflationary readings. Analysts broadly expected the Fed to discuss a timeline for tapering its asset purchase program and a potential timeline for interest rate hikes. Instead, the Fed made no mention of a taper timeline and signaled they anticipate the first interest rate hike to occur in 2023. Overall, the report was very positive for equities, which is why the SPY so quickly recovered after an initial dump on Wednesday. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion,  it seems the Fed’s decision to leave out a “taper timeline” in the latest meeting reinforces the view consistently reiterated by the members of the Fed that current inflationary readings are “transitory” (meaning not permanent) and largely reflects factors caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent economic shutdown, such as global supply chain disruptions, materials shortages, and labor market imbalances. Moreover, I suspect Jerome Powell wants to avoid another “Taper Tantrum” like the one in 2013 and intends to be as clear as possible about the Fed’s expectations in order to avoid mixed messages (Read more about the 2013 Taper Tantrum <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp\">here,</a> but basically markets freaked out after the Fed announced it was tapering quantitative easing passed during the 2008 recession since the economy had largely recovered by that point). In the end, the market kept going unabated, something I find very likely to happen again when the Fed inevitably announces they are tapering. In the end, I expect taper talks to begin towards the end of this year, but the lack of its mention in this Fed outlook meeting is an encouraging sign the Fed is not concerned about the elevated inflation readings. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the median projection among Fed officials is now for two rate hikes in 2023 despite the Fed raising inflation expectation for 2021, another sign the central bank remains unconcerned with the current levels of inflation. While the 2023 timeline is sooner than originally predicted, the two year timeline signals that the Fed will continue to move slowly and deliberately when considering any policy adjustment. </p>\n\n<p>Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed&#39;s preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting &quot;base effects&quot; as prices rebound after last year&#39;s pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Amblin Partners, a movie studio headed by famed director Steven Spielberg, announced a partnership with Netflix (NFLX) to produce future films.<br/></li>\n<li>Apple became the fourth major digital company to face closer scrutiny from Germany&#39;s antitrust watchdog on Monday after the cartel office said it had launched an investigation into whether the tech giant is exploiting its market position.</li>\n<li>Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a note Monday that households were the largest source of equity demand in the first quarter of 2021 after generating net purchases of $172 billion. “We estimate that households currently allocate 44% of their assets to equities, slightly below the all-time high allocation of 46% in 2000.
