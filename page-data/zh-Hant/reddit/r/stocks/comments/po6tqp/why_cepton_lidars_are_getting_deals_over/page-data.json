The lidar space is quite full of names nowadays, but Cepton isn&#39;t usually one you hear. So why would GM select them?</p>\n\n<p>First off, SWAP-c. What is SWAP-c?</p>\n\n<p><strong>S</strong>ize<strong>W</strong>eight<strong>a</strong>nd <strong>P</strong>ower-<strong>C</strong>ost</p>\n\n<p>Cepton&#39;s nova lidar is &lt;$100 while being ultra-compact and low-power. The small form factor lets automotive manufacturers place the lidar in a variety of places:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/IomKLYB.png\">behind the windshield</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/sbLVTh0.png\">in headlamps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/kH2lXQi.png\">in fascias</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The competitive price is simply too good.</p>\n\n<p>Cepton has partnered with a key tier 1 automotive parts supplier, Koito. This makes Cepton VERY attractive to OEMs, as Koito will definitely be able to mass-produce &amp; integrate Cepton&#39;s lidars. Oh, did I mention Koito is the #1 global headlamp supplier?</p>\n\n<p>The ability to mass-produce the units while maintaining automotive grade is very difficult. You constantly see lidar companies showing off prototypes, but top OEMs like Toyota and GM want reliability and scalability.</p>\n\n<p>As taken from <a href=\"https://groundtruthautonomy.com/suddenly-everyone-is-talking-about-lidar-here-are-10-things-you-need-to-know/\">this article</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be blunt, making lidar units is hard; mass producing them is even harder. Automakers need lidar units that are automotive grade and meet the exacting requirements of self-driving system developers. They also require a manufacturing and supply chain capable of supporting high-volume production. From R&amp;D to manufacturing, supply, and after-sales support, lidar manufacturers need to demonstrate that they can consistently produce low runs of lidar prototypes and high volumes of commercial operation-ready lidar units to a growing number of markets globally. A lidar unit includes optics, electronics, and microscopic mechanical components. With the technology in its infancy, and with no longevity of experience to turn to, very few manufacturers have the required combination of manufacturing skills, or the ability to competitively produce at high volumes. Automakers and self-driving vehicle companies will look to those suppliers that can reliably produce cutting-edge technology at a reasonable cost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s not forget performance as a factor. There are other dirt cheap lidars out in the wild, but they are neither automotive-grade nor performant.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/po6tqp/why_cepton_lidars_are_getting_deals_over/","title":"Why Cepton lidars are getting deals over competitors ($GCAC)","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-14T19:05:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-14 19:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"po6tqp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/po6tqp/why_cepton_lidars_are_getting_deals_over/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/po6tqp/why_cepton_lidars_are_getting_deals_over/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Nebuchadrezar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nebuchadrezar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Nebuchadrezar","score":96,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Cepton社のライダーが競合他社よりも優位に立っている理由 ($GCAC)","the_new_excerpt":"GCACの私のポジション：1000株＠9.93ドル\n\n先週、Forbesは次のように報じた。\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/09/general-motors-selects-cepton-to-supply-lidar-for-2023-production/]\nGMは、2023年から2027年に生産される次期自動車のライダサプライヤーとしてCeptonを選択したと報じた。\nGMは2023年から2027年に生産される予定の車のライダサプライヤーとしてCeptonを選んだと、先週のフォーブスが報じました。このライダ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么Cepton激光雷达比竞争对手更容易获得交易（$GCAC）？","the_new_excerpt":"我在$GCAC的仓位：1000股@9.93美元\n\n上周，福布斯报道\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/09/general-motors-selects-cepton-to-supply-lidar-for-2023-production/]\n通用汽车已选择Cepton作为其激光雷达供应商，用于即将在2023-2027年生产的汽车。\n2023-2027年生产的汽车。该激光雷达...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼Cepton激光雷達比競爭對手更容易獲得交易（$GCAC）？","the_new_excerpt":"我在$GCAC的倉位：1000股@9.93美元\n\n上週，福布斯報道\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/09/general-motors-selects-cepton-to-supply-lidar-for-2023-production/]\n通用汽車已選擇Cepton作爲其激光雷達供應商，用於即將在2023-2027年生產的汽車。\n2023-2027年生產的汽車。該激光雷達...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1437591998895173633","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1437591998895173633","title":"At the Met Gala.
