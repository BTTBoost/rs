Just because someone made 1000% gains on something doesn&#39;t mean you are going to make that.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, that the faster any asset climbs up the faster it comes down like a house of cards. If it had no resistance going up, there is no support going down and when such stocks crack, they fall through the roof in a matter of hours, not even days.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, you get ads on YouTube every 2 seconds with someone shouting in your face with so called their magic formula where their students make $500-$2000 every trade. Don&#39;t fall for these snake oil salesman. If making money were that easy, nobody would work their ass off for years just to buy a house or a car.</p>\n\n<p>Pick up a book and learn the basics of Finance. Fundamentals will help you get a handle of how to start valuing a company. While Technical charts play a role in short to medium term movements of the stock, long term is always going to be based on Fundamentals. Watch Peter Lynch&#39;s videos on YouTube, he is an old school investor just like Warren Buffett, but has some really good food for thoughts in his videos.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, if you are investing in Crpto be extremely conservative. 10% of your portfolio is too much. Anything more than that, and you lose your hard earned savings very quickly if things go south.</p>\n\n<p>I understand there is a Euphoria when you make quick money, but derivatives like Futures and Options are sure shot way of getting screwed if you don&#39;t know what you are doing. Everyone has an itch to make a lot of money in a short period of time, but trust me, losing your original investment is one the worst feeling you can ever have if you earned that money by working hard.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t know anything at all about investing and want to start putting some money into an investment account, buy a broad market based ETF like SPY or QQQ on a regular basis. Think $100-$200-$500/month. Time in the market is always going to beat timing the market.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, as Warren Buffett said - Rule 1: Never lose money and Rule 2: Never forget Rule 1.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Don&#39;t invest blindly in Stocks that some friend/stranger recommended you. Efforts to make money quickly on Stocks, Crpto, or Derivatives (Futures and Options) without understanding the fundamentals and risks, will make you lose your hard earned money and your shirt. If you don&#39;t know anything about investing, buy broad market based ETF like SPY and QQQ on a regular basis.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r029h7/some_words_of_advice_for_those_who_are_entering/","title":"Some words of advice for those who are entering stock market for the first time.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-23T04:12:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-23 04:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r029h7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r029h7/some_words_of_advice_for_those_who_are_entering/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r029h7/some_words_of_advice_for_those_who_are_entering/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"flying_cofin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/flying_cofin","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"flying_cofin","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"初めて株式市場に参入する方へのアドバイスをお願いします。","the_new_excerpt":"初めて投資をする人、特に若い投資家は、友人や親戚、あるいは友人が持っている株を買ってしまうという罠に陥りやすいものです。\n友人や親戚、あるいはインターネット上の見知らぬ人が勧めた株を買ってしまうという罠に陥りがちです。\nインターネット上で見知らぬ人に勧められた銘柄を買うという罠に陥りがちです。誰かが何かで1000％の利益を上げたからといって\n誰かが何かで1000％の利益を上げたからといって、あなたがそれを得られるとは限りません。\n\n忘れてはいけないのは、その...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"给那些第一次进入股市的人一些建议。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你是第一次投资，尤其是年轻的投资者，很容易\n陷入购买朋友、亲戚或互联网上陌生人推荐的股票的陷阱中。\n互联网上的陌生人推荐的股票。仅仅因为有人在某些方面取得了1000%的收益\n并不意味着你也能取得这样的收益。\n\n请记住，这不是一个简单的问题。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"給那些第一次進入股市的人一些建議。","the_new_excerpt":"如果你是第一次投資，尤其是年輕的投資者，很容易\n陷入購買朋友、親戚或互聯網上陌生人推薦的股票的陷阱中。\n互聯網上的陌生人推薦的股票。僅僅因爲有人在某些方面取得了1000%的收益\n並不意味着你也能取得這樣的收益。\n\n請記住，這不是一個簡單的問題。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qzij09","excerpt":"These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed\nposts.\n\nSome helpful links:\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy] for charts, fundamentals, and\n   aggregated news on individual stocks\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n *…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qzij09/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_nov_22_2021/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday - Nov 22, 2021","date":"November 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion 月曜日 - 11月22日, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"毎日のディスカッションは、月曜から金曜まで、テーマごとに行われます。\nが行われます。\n\n参考になるリンクをご紹介します。\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy] チャート、ファンダメンタルズ、個別銘柄の集約されたニュースのための\n   チャート、ファンダメンタルズ、個別銘柄のニュースを見ることができます。\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n *...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday - Nov 22, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"这些日常讨论从周一到周五进行，包括在我们的主题性\n帖子。\n\n一些有用的链接。\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy] 提供图表、基本面和单个股票的汇总新闻。\n   个别股票的汇总新闻\n * 彭博市场新闻[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n *...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday - Nov 22, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"這些日常討論從週一到週五進行，包括在我們的主題性\n帖子。\n\n一些有用的鏈接。\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy] 提供圖表、基本面和單個股票的彙總新聞。\n   個別股票的彙總新聞\n * 彭博市場新聞[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n *...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qzoqdd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzoqdd/not_stock_related_but_heres_a_photo_of_me_and_the/","title":"Not stock related.. but here's a photo of me and the wall street bull.
