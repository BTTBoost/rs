Recently I was in the barber shop and overheard one of the barbers and a client discussing the “inevitable” market crash to come and how they were moving all of their money to cash. </p>\n\n<p>In another instance, my wife comes home one day last week and tells me that a mortgage broker, around 60 years of age, tells her that the market is about to crash and that she has moved to 100% bonds, and that we should too! We are in our early thirties. My wife asked me what I thought about that. My response was “whatever makes her sleep at night, but we aren’t doing that.”  </p>\n\n<p>And most recently, my own father, who is also around 60 years of age, tells me just yesterday that he is going to move his 401k into something safe because he feels the next 18 months could “get bad.” His 401k offers a virtually risk-free low yield money market fund. When he asked me what I thought about it, I again told him to do whatever makes him sleep at night, but that timing the market is rarely, if ever, successful. My strategy never changes. Each month I buy more of the same index funds, no matter what the market is doing. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I only offered my father this minimal advice because he asked my opinion, but the truth is I want to try to talk him out if it and tell him to instead focus on a comfortable allocation. I’d also like to tell him to ignore the noise, and enjoy the sale, if one were to arise. But I’m curious, what woul you do? I’m a firm believer that what a person does with their money is their business, but when it comes to loved ones, I’m inclined to try just a little harder.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pxlzsa/how_much_advice_should_you_give/","title":"How much advice should you give?","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"September 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-29T23:31:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-29 23:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pxlzsa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pxlzsa/how_much_advice_should_you_give/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pxlzsa/how_much_advice_should_you_give/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"mlangdon23","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mlangdon23","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mlangdon23","score":18,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"どの程度のアドバイスをすればいいのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"近い将来、市場が暴落するのではないかという話は、日増しに耳にするようになりました。\n日に日に耳にするようになりました。最近、私は理髪店にいて、理髪師の一人と顧客が\n理容師の一人とお客さんが、「市場の暴落は避けられない」という話をしているのを耳にしました。\n彼らはすべての資金を現金に移しているという。\n\nそれは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你应该提供多少建议？","the_new_excerpt":"关于在不久的将来可能出现的市场崩溃的嗡嗡声是我似乎听到的东西\n我似乎每天都能听到越来越多的消息。最近，我在理发店里听到一个理发师和一个客户讨论\n理发师和一位客户在讨论 \"不可避免的 \"市场崩溃，以及\n他们如何把所有的钱都转为现金。\n\n在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你應該提供多少建議？","the_new_excerpt":"關於在不久的將來可能出現的市場崩潰的嗡嗡聲是我似乎聽到的東西\n我似乎每天都能聽到越來越多的消息。最近，我在理髮店裏聽到一個理髮師和一個客戶討論\n理髮師和一位客戶在討論 \"不可避免的 \"市場崩潰，以及\n他們如何把所有的錢都轉爲現金。\n\n在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-py3szk","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 29, 2021\n\nAfter suffering one of the worst days all year yesterday, stocks stabilized\ntoday, with the three major indexes trading modestly green as Treasury yields\npulled back from multi-month highs.
