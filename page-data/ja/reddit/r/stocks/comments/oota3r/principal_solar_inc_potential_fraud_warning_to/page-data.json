I have no position in this ticker what so ever, including short.</p>\n\n<p>I saw the Tweet from the official  PSWW Twitter account on July 1st in regards to the eTruck acquisition  and was pretty excited, until my deep dive occurred. There is a lot of  mystery behind this company that started fundraising for a facility in  2013 but does not currently have one on file. Russel Knudsen is the  listed President of eTruck but who is he and why did PSWW block me on  Twitter for asking about this?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>eTruck  tried to fundraise $500,000 in 2013 for a facility and patent fees.  What happened? Where is the facility and the patents for this &quot;ground  breaking&quot; technology?</p>\n\n<p>They stated they their Chief Engineer is one of the top in the world but, who is it?</p>\n\n<p>PSWW listed office address is... a Wealth Management Company? Phone number straight to voicemail and it&#39;s full?</p>\n\n<p>What does Russell Knudsen REALLY do as a job, it&#39;s actually surprising.</p>\n\n<p>Executive Assistant to the CEO of $PSWW posts on... StockTwits?!</p>\n\n<p>See bullet proof evidence and sources below.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Image  to the facility in the video PSWW is implying will be the location of  the facility, beautiful. As it was announced as a &quot;New Manufacturing  Facility&quot; it made me think there must be a preexisting one? Not that I  could find.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>In  fact, during my deep dive over this facility I found some disturbing  revelations. I first found the eTruck registered address on the  OpenCorporates website. Also note the Agent Name/Directors/Officers at  the bottom.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ne/10162308\">https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ne/10162308</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This address as shown on Google maps in the image below. 810 Skyline Drive, Elkhorn. 68022, a residential property.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I think to myself, maybe I just need to look at the Agent Name to find the address.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>20680 Roundup Circle, Elkhorn, another residential property.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Interesting  enough, Judith once lived here but has not lived here since 2019  meanwhile Russell has not been associated with this address since 2011,  pre eTruck launch.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/find/person/plu40lru2600692r4n69\">https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/find/person/plu40lru2600692r4n69</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/find/person/px62un84l0n0l624n2ll6\">https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/find/person/px62un84l0n0l624n2ll6</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This  brings the question of, does eTruck actually exist?! Where is the  website? Where is the facility? Where are the patents? The only thing on  file I could find was a trademark for their logo in 2013. In the  presentation they note their Chief Engineer is one of the top in the  world but I cannot find them. They have raised funds since 2013 but do  not have patents, a facility nor even a website.</p>\n\n<p>Also  claimed to have 2,000 orders with a $25,000 margin in 2013, what  happened? $50 million dollars that just never happened? But the Tweet by  PSWW stated they have capicity for 6 trucks in the preexisting  facility?</p>\n\n<p>Link, also lists Russell Knudsen as President:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/etruck\">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/etruck</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The  most damning piece of evidence in my opinion is Russel Knudsens  ownership of Knudsen Automotive Inc, a body repair and paint shop. You  heard that right, he is not even an automotive mechanic but instead is a  BODY REPAIR AND PAINT professional.</p>\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://nebraska.repair-auto.org/273696-knudsen_automotive_inc.htm\">https://nebraska.repair-auto.org/273696-knudsen_automotive_inc.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Another  crazy part, the truepeoplesearch link I shared for Russell Knudsen  earlier does not even have an actual address listed as his current  address but instead a P.O. Box which is also the same P.O. Box that is  listed as the mailing address for Knudsen Automotive Inc.</p>\n\n<p>P.O.  Box is also registered to another business Russell Knudsen used to run,  a financial consulting business that seemed to have issue with paying  taxes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nebraska.gov/sos/corp/corpsearch.cgi\">https://www.nebraska.gov/sos/corp/corpsearch.cgi</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>PO Box linked to Knudson Automotive Inc and Russell Knudsen current address</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.siclists.com/nebraska/omaha/Knudsen-Automotive-Inc_1m9xX.html\">http://www.siclists.com/nebraska/omaha/Knudsen-Automotive-Inc_1m9xX.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Bonus DD on $PSWW themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The  address for the company according to Google and SEC filings, is a firm  called &quot;Constant Wealth Management&quot;, no known office. Listed phone  number in SEC filings and Google go straight to voicemail and the  mailbox is full. See for yourselves.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>CEO  has many aliases, Kenrick Toussaint, Bryce Toussaint, Rick Toussaint,  K. Bryce Toussaint, Kenrick Bryce Toussaint and I&#39;m sure more I could  not find.</p>\n\n<p>CEO also seems to have a  past history with a lot of OTC companies, MDVL, Myos Rens Technology  Inc , Principal Solar Inc, China Xiangtai Food Co Ltd, Swordfish  Financial Inc (OTCMKTS:SWRF), GWHP, TRIG etc... Hard to find them all  with so many aliases</p>\n\n<p>Seems to be a  trend of the CEO to join a company board/take over as CEO, gets shares,  stays listed on the board for about 2 years, cashes out and on to the  next one. Walks like a duck, looks like a duck and acts like a duck...</p>\n\n<p>His  assistant, Lindsey Harastas &quot;Executive Assistant to the CEO and CFO at  Principal Solar, INC&quot; also has a entry on their LinkedIn stating they  have been a professional options trader for the past 9 years and is also  active on StockTwits.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Lindsey  actively posts on StockTwits acknowledging comments praising the  company and positive news articles, unethical at best and illegal at  worst. Especially if she holds shares in the company that are not  reported to the SEC properly.</p>\n\n<p>She  also has not posted often but made a personal post and liked about 5-6  others on the $PSWW board on 7/20/21, the day they released news but did  not see a price increase as I was bearish on that board the last two  weeks while collecting DD. Her last post was February 21, 2021. Had no  idea she posted on there or liked tweets relevant to me towards the end  of my DD.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Sorry  the bashers are not educated with the same level of insider information  as you, Lindsey. Why so emotional though? Hopefully you don&#39;t own  shares of the company you have inside information to that are not  reported to the SEC.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR</p>\n\n<p>I asked PSWW about Russel Knudsen on Twitter in which they promptly blocked me, so I chose to investigate further.</p>\n\n<p>2nd one down</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>eTruck has &quot;existed&quot; for 13 years with no website, facility or patents although they attempted to fundraise $500,000 8 years ago</p>\n\n<p>Russell Knudsen, President of eTruck is a 77 year old who appears to be a retired autobody and paint specialist.</p>\n\n<p>He is the listed President of eTruck but it is not listed he is actual associated businesses in any officials businesses</p>\n\n<p>Listed addresses found for eTruck are resdential properties</p>\n\n<p>Russell Knudsen is also tied to Knudsen &amp; Associates and according to the company files they had issue with paying taxes</p>\n\n<p>CEO of $PSWW has at least 5 aliases and has been involved with at least 8 OTC tickers throughout his career</p>\n\n<p>His executive assistant is also a professional options trader and praises the company on StockTwits</p>\n\n<p>COO  is also listed as a professional trader on LinkedIn, only 3 relevant  employees I can seem to find. The board of executives is soley made up  of Kenrick Toussaint and Anthony Lerner. You would think the 3rd person  with the most insider information would be the CEOs personal assistant.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Fact:  One of two scenarios is true, $PSWW leadership did not do any DD on  this acquisition OR, they did their DD and did not care because the  acquisition would be great for pumping the ticker price.</p>\n\n<p>Personal  Opinion: To me it appears that CEO Kenrick works with a lot of OTC  companies for a short period for shares and leaves. In the case of  $PSWW, it almost seems like they are going for any flashy licensing deal  that is potentially relevant to todays market climate to increase the  stock price before cashing out. EV deal after EV deal, a VR deal. Bold  claims such as 8xing their oil well count from 15 to over 100 in the  next year. Quantity over quality.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful what you invest in, do your own DD and BE CAREFUL of OTC pump and dumps, especially on social medias like Twitter.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oota3r/principal_solar_inc_potential_fraud_warning_to/","title":"Principal Solar Inc Potential Fraud Warning to Investors","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-21T19:28:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-21 19:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"854603f5-ac7f-5c41-a423-1e320c7a7d64","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oota3r/principal_solar_inc_potential_fraud_warning_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oota3r/principal_solar_inc_potential_fraud_warning_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"BruhTradess","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BruhTradess","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BruhTradess","score":80,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"プリンシパル・ソーラー・インク 詐欺の可能性に関する投資家への警告","the_new_excerpt":"スレッドからすべてのリンクと画像を削除しました。\n私のプロフィールをご覧ください。私はこのティッカーに何のポジションも持っていません。\nショートも含めてね。\n\n7月1日にPSWWの公式ツイッターアカウントからeTruckの買収に関するツイートを見ました。\neTruckの買収に関して、7月1日にPSWWの公式ツイッターアカウントからのツイートを見て、かなり興奮しました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"信安太阳能公司向投资者发出潜在的欺诈性警告","the_new_excerpt":"删除了主题中的所有链接和图片，要想更全面地了解正在发生的事情\n请看我的个人资料。我对这个股票没有任何立场。\n包括空头。\n\n我在7月1日看到了来自PSWW官方推特账户的关于\n收购eTruck的消息，并感到非常兴奋。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"信安太陽能公司向投資者發出潛在的欺詐性警告","the_new_excerpt":"刪除了主題中的所有鏈接和圖片，要想更全面地瞭解正在發生的事情\n請看我的個人資料。我對這個股票沒有任何立場。\n包括空頭。\n\n我在7月1日看到了來自PSWW官方推特賬戶的關於\n收購eTruck的消息，並感到非常興奮。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f557f43f-8ef3-56af-ab1b-b3679f0363ad","excerpt":"Have a general question?
