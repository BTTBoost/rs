 mental health, whether its algorithm encouraged social discord, and how it  moderates elites. </p>\n\n<p>A company whistleblower who leaked internal documents to the Journal also  testified before Congress last week, as lawmakers turned their  attention to the renewed public debate over Facebook&#39;s(FB) prominent role in peoples&#39; lives. </p>\n\n<p>Facebook (FB) co-founder  and CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said that &quot;many of the claims  don&#39;t make any sense,&quot; pushing back against allegations that arose in the  Journal&#39;s reports and the whistleblower&#39;s testimony, in a post on social  media. </p>\n\n<p>Blair Levin, an analyst at London-based technology industry research  group New Street Research, wrote Sunday that &quot; while we have been  skeptical that past revelations would lead to government action, we think this  time is different and as a result, we think Facebook(FB) may now face a similar challenge from  increased litigation as tobacco, or more recently, OxyContin.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Levin served as chief of staff to the chair of the Federal  Communications Commission in the 1990s. </p>\n\n<p>The analyst said that while the facts and damages are different for Facebook(FB) than those faced by  the tobacco industry or Purdue Pharma -- the maker of opioid medication  OxyContin -- the fundamental legal framework is the same. </p>\n\n<p>There is a product with problematic consequences for many people, management  knowledge of such, and actions by management &quot;that not only failed to mitigate  the harm but arguably increased those problematic consequences,&quot; Levin said. </p>\n\n<p>In the same way that public outcry against tobacco and opioid makers led to  massive class action and state attorneys general-led lawsuits, Levin said the  recent revelations against Facebook(FB) creates similar incentives to bring  litigation against the company. </p>\n\n<p>While Facebook(FB) has  faced scrutiny before, there is far more attention on the company this time, in  part because of the role that harms to children plays in the recent allegations,  Levin noted. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Discovery is likely to yield even more problematic evidence for Facebook(FB), and the dynamics  create an opportunity for a settlement that would address the issues more  quickly than legislation,&quot; Levin said. &quot;We think litigation is likely to be more  damaging to Facebook(FB)  than legislation.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Facebook (FB) stock was  0.7% lower in U.S. premarket trade Monday. The stock is down 12.3% over the past  month. Facebook (FB) didn&#39;t  immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q5y7in/facebook_faces_legal_risk_similar_to_big_tobacco/","title":"Facebook Faces Legal Risk Similar to Big Tobacco or OxyContin, Analyst Says","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-11T16:37:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-11 16:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q5y7in","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q5y7in/facebook_faces_legal_risk_similar_to_big_tobacco/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q5y7in/facebook_faces_legal_risk_similar_to_big_tobacco/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Kwikstep","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kwikstep","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Kwikstep","score":2916,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"フェイスブックには、タバコやオキシコンチンのような法的リスクがあるとアナリストが指摘","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-faces-legal-risk-big-tobacco-oxycontin-51633956119\n\n(（PAYWALL）)\n\n記事から\n\nフェイスブック(FB)の社会的役割をめぐる最近の暴露や議会からの監視は、フェイスブック(FB)に対する大規模な訴訟につながる可能性がある。\n社会におけるFacebook(FB)の役割をめぐる最近の暴露や議会の監視は、ソーシャルメディアの巨人に対する大規模な訴訟につながる可能性があるという。\n新しい研究によると...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"分析师表示，Facebook面临的法律风险与大烟草公司或奥施康定类似","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-faces-legal-risk-big-tobacco-oxycontin-51633956119\n\n(PAYWALL)\n\n文章简介\n\n最近，国会对Facebook(FB)在社会中的作用进行了披露和审查。\n社会的作用，可能会导致对这家社交媒体巨头的重大诉讼，根据\n根据新的研究，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"分析師表示，Facebook面臨的法律風險與大煙草公司或奧施康定類似","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-faces-legal-risk-big-tobacco-oxycontin-51633956119\n\n(PAYWALL)\n\n文章簡介\n\n最近，國會對Facebook(FB)在社會中的作用進行了披露和審查。\n社會的作用，可能會導致對這家社交媒體巨頭的重大訴訟，根據\n根據新的研究，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q5ufqy","excerpt":"Anybody looking for where to invest, the energy sector is worth a close look.'\n\nBuying into any oil company will make money with Occidental standing out.\n\nStocks like ED and OKE are no-brainer buys.\n\nFor alternative energy look at GoSun on StartEngine.","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q5ufqy/oil_is_over_80_natural_gas_is_going_to_the_moon/","title":"Oil is Over $80, Natural Gas is Going to the Moon","date":"October 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"原油は80ドル以上、天然ガスは月へ行く","the_new_excerpt":"投資先を探している人は、エネルギー部門をよく見てみる価値がある」。\n\nどの石油会社に買っても儲かるが、Occidentalは際立っている。\n\nEDやOKEのような株は、間違いなく買いです。\n\n代替エネルギーについては、StartEngineのGoSunを見てみよう。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"石油超过80美元，天然气要上月球了","the_new_excerpt":"任何正在寻找投资方向的人，能源行业都值得仔细研究'。\n\n买入任何石油公司都会赚钱，西方石油公司脱颖而出。\n\n像ED和OKE这样的股票是没有问题的买点。\n\n对于替代能源，请看StartEngine上的GoSun。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"石油超過80美元，天然氣要上月球了","the_new_excerpt":"任何正在尋找投資方向的人，能源行業都值得仔細研究'。\n\n買入任何石油公司都會賺錢，西方石油公司脫穎而出。\n\n像ED和OKE這樣的股票是沒有問題的買點。\n\n對於替代能源，請看StartEngine上的GoSun。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1447586923917283329","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1447586923917283329","title":"Covid-19 hospitalizations in the US are down 41% from their peak in early September. 🙏 https://t.co/KLVNO3xla3","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 11, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国におけるCovid-19による入院は、9月初旬のピーク時から41％減少しています。🙏 https://t.co/KLVNO3xla3","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国的Covid-19住院人数比9月初的峰值下降了41%。🙏https://t.co/KLVNO3xla3","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國的Covid-19住院人數比9月初的峯值下降了41%。🙏https://t.co/KLVNO3xla3","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q5y7in","previousId":"RedditPost-q5ufqy","nextId":"TweetPost-1447586923917283329","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q5y7in/facebook_faces_legal_risk_similar_to_big_tobacco/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
