The Nasdaq (QQQ) reached a fresh record high for the second time this week and the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover following its worst week since October 2020. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.54% higher and is two points away from its record high. With earnings for Q2 fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS&#39;s Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be &quot;need to be revised higher.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Today, in a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. </p>\n\n<p>As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. </p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.</p>\n\n<p>Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed&#39;s preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting &quot;base effects&quot; as prices rebound after last year&#39;s pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the boar</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter (TWTR) is moving forward with plans to increase monetization opportunities.

Users must have at least 10,000 followers on Twitter to be eligible to apply for Super Follows, and at least 1,000 followers to apply for first access to Ticketed Spaces. </li>\n<li>Facebook (FB) is expanding its &#39;Shops&#39; feature to messaging app WhatsApp and to Facebook Marketplace.</li>\n<li>Fortnite&quot; creator Epic Games, which is entrenched in a legal battle with Apple Inc, said on Tuesday it now has more than 500 million accounts.
