A few months ago, they released a Tesla valuation model that can be found on their github <a href=\"https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model\">here</a>.  I don&#39;t care to comment on the assumptions of their business -- as 2025 hasn&#39;t yet come, it would just be my word against ARKs.  There is, however, an interesting assumption at the bottom of their Tesla valuation that I <em>do</em> want to talk about.  They assume shares outstanding will increase from 960M at the end of Q4 2020 to 964M in 2025.  This is integral to their per share price target.  </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s check how Arkk is doing on that assumption.  In terms of financial quarters, we&#39;re 10% of the way to the end of 2025, Tesla should be around 960.4M shares.  According to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021000524/tsla-20210630.htm\">Tesla&#39;s most recent 10-Q, pg. 1</a>, there are 990M shares outstanding as of July 22.  That&#39;s 7x the shares ARK assumed in 10% of the time.  But Tesla hasn&#39;t issued any new shares, so what exactly is going on here?  </p>\n\n<p>The answer lies in the diluted share count.  Diluted share count includes all sources of additional shares that could be converted or exercised, e.g. convertible bonds, Employee stock options, warrants, etc.  These instruments are exercised over time, and the basic share count will tend towards the diluted count.  On pg. 13 of the 10-Q, we can see that including dilutive effects, Tesla&#39;s share count is closer to 1.12B.    </p>\n\n<p>The utility of the diluted share count should be obvious.  If one is modeling a security five years out, especially if the projected price movement is bullish, it should be assumed that all outstanding stock options, warrants and convertibles will be exercised and added to the share count to create an accurate price target.  20% of Tesla&#39;s outstanding dilutive instruments have been exercised in the last six months.  Diluted share counts tend to catch up quickly.  </p>\n\n<p>Why would companies dilute their shares like this?  Employee stock options can pad cashflow and convertible bonds&#39; optionality can decrease interest coupon rates.  These are highly desirable among growth companies with poor cashflow and low/nonexistent credit ratings.  Tesla suffered from both of these problems for many years.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings us back to ARK.  ARK largely deals in early stage startups and growth companies.  They should see a lot of these instruments being used.  They should be intimately familiar with the effects of SBC, convertibles, and warrants.  Yet, they didn&#39;t consider these effects in their last two models.  This leads to three possible conclusions:<br/>\n1) No one at ARK realized the model was made using the basic share count.  </p>\n\n<p>2) ARK intentionally used the basic share count to increase their price target.</p>\n\n<p>3) ARK&#39;s security analysts don&#39;t know the importance of using a diluted share count in this situation.  </p>\n\n<p>None of these options paint a particularly rosy picture of the firm.  If you invest in ARK, this is the quality of research being used to make investing decisions.  Caveat Emptor.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pe5av4/tesla_diluted_share_count_and_ark_research/","title":"Tesla, diluted share count, and ARK research.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-30T02:52:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-30 02:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e4c12d20-36fc-5f43-bf84-f8f10506a257","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pe5av4/tesla_diluted_share_count_and_ark_research/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pe5av4/tesla_diluted_share_count_and_ark_research/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"thri54","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thri54","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"thri54","score":144,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テスラ、希薄化された株数、アークの研究。","the_new_excerpt":"ちょっとARKの話をしましょう。ARKは研究内容を非常にオープンにしています。\n積極的に運用されているファンドの中でも特にそうだと思います。数ヶ月前、彼らは\nTeslaの評価モデルを公開していますが、これは彼らのgithubにある\n[https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model]。I...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"特斯拉，稀释的股份数，以及ARK研究。","the_new_excerpt":"让我们谈一谈ARK的情况。ARK对他们的研究非常开放，这比大多数主动管理型基金要好得多。\n这比大多数积极管理的基金要好得多。几个月前，他们\n发布了一个特斯拉的估值模型，可以在他们的github上找到。\n[https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model]。I...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉，稀釋的股份數，以及ARK研究。","the_new_excerpt":"讓我們談一談ARK的情況。ARK對他們的研究非常開放，這比大多數主動管理型基金要好得多。\n這比大多數積極管理的基金要好得多。幾個月前，他們\n發佈了一個特斯拉的估值模型，可以在他們的github上找到。\n[https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model]。I...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4e0a5ba5-28e8-5696-ad88-6242a62ed47e","excerpt":"People who work as an Stock Analyst, I understand that they're paid to do their\nresearch for companies and sectors, but for people not working as an analyst and\npost extensive DD, analysis, and price prediction/expectation, at the end of\ntheir debrief, they disclose that they don't own any shares of…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pe1io3/why_do_people_know_it_but_dont_own_it/","title":"Why do people know it, but don't own it?","date":"August 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"なぜ人々はそれを知っているのに、所有していないのか？","the_new_excerpt":"証券アナリストとして働いている人は、お金をもらって企業や分野の調査をするのはわかりますが\n企業やセクターの調査をするのはわかりますが、アナリストとして働いていない人が\n膨大なDD、分析、価格の予測・予想を投稿し、報告会の最後には\n報告会の最後に、「私は株式を保有していません」と明かしています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么人们知道它，但不拥有它？","the_new_excerpt":"担任股票分析师的人，我理解他们是拿钱来做公司和行业的研究。\n的公司和部门的研究，但对于不从事分析师工作和\n发布大量的DD、分析和价格预测/预期的人，在他们的汇报结束时\n他们的汇报结束时，他们会透露他们没有拥有任何......的股票。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼人們知道它，但不擁有它？","the_new_excerpt":"擔任股票分析師的人，我理解他們是拿錢來做公司和行業的研究。\n的公司和部門的研究，但對於不從事分析師工作和\n發佈大量的DD、分析和價格預測/預期的人，在他們的彙報結束時\n他們的彙報結束時，他們會透露他們沒有擁有任何......的股票。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ade92d30-a614-5957-b37e-649478eb2b74","excerpt":"I have way more cash in the bank than what I need between paychecks.
