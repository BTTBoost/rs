It seems as though CrowdStrike (CRWD) has a larger portfolio of products across the space and CloudFlare (NET) distinguishes itself by its focus on internet security although from investor decks they also project Zero Trust Network Infrastructure to be a larger portion of revenue in coming years. Zscaler (ZS) it seems focuses on more mid-sized business it seems and actually offers an integrated product with Zscaler + CrowdStrike: <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/partners/crowdstrike\">https://www.zscaler.com/partners/crowdstrike</a></p>\n\n<p>Without understanding all the nuances, I was most struct by stock performances: NET is up 1100% in past two years while ZS is up over 600% compared to &quot;only&quot; 315% for my Fortinet (FTNT).</p>\n\n<p>I suppose my questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>NET&#39;s revenue growth has been constant around 50% for several years. Management actually guided down to 37% for the next quarter but most people seem to have dismissed? What is the market pricing in? I get &quot;work from home&quot; and internet focus but why has Cloudflare&#39;s stock done much better despite growth near or below others (lack of direct competitor?) in space and consistent losses?</li>\n<li>ZS Rev growth seemed to slow but is back up around 60%. What happened? What is the biggest risk to these stocks more broadly?</li>\n<li>Broadly how to think of these stocks?</li>\n<li>Considering I plan to keep FTNT, would NET be the best addition to balance out?</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qfo9lt/cybersecurity_stocks_crowdstrike_cloudflare/","title":"Cybersecurity Stocks: CrowdStrike, CloudFlare, Zscaler, Fortinet","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-26T06:29:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-26 06:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qfo9lt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qfo9lt/cybersecurity_stocks_crowdstrike_cloudflare/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qfo9lt/cybersecurity_stocks_crowdstrike_cloudflare/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"compoundluck","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/compoundluck","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"compoundluck","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"サイバーセキュリティ関連株。CrowdStrike、CloudFlare、Zscaler、Fortinet","the_new_excerpt":"サイバー攻撃についてほとんど知らなかったが、ますます頻繁に起こっていることに気づいた。\n今年の初めに攻撃がますます頻繁になっていることに気づき、私はFortinetのポジションを開始しました（実際にSP500の株式スクリーナーで見つけたと思います）。\n150ドル前後でFortinetのポジションを開始しました（実際にはSP500のストックスクリーナーで見つけました）。\n言うまでもなく、この投資には満足しています。\n\nこの投資に満足しているのは言うまでもありませんが、私はこの分野に注目していました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"网络安全股票。CrowdStrike, CloudFlare, Zscaler, Fortinet","the_new_excerpt":"我对网络迫害知之甚少，但注意到今年早些时候越来越频繁的攻击。\n在今年早些时候，我开始在Fortinet中建仓（我相信我是在Fortinet中找到的）。\n实际上是在SP500股票筛选器上发现的），价格在150美元左右，不用说，我对这项投资很满意。\n我对这项投资很满意。\n\n我一直在关注这个行业...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"網絡安全股票。CrowdStrike, CloudFlare, Zscaler, Fortinet","the_new_excerpt":"我對網絡迫害知之甚少，但注意到今年早些時候越來越頻繁的攻擊。\n在今年早些時候，我開始在Fortinet中建倉（我相信我是在Fortinet中找到的）。\n實際上是在SP500股票篩選器上發現的），價格在150美元左右，不用說，我對這項投資很滿意。\n我對這項投資很滿意。\n\n我一直在關注這個行業...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1452499397909094402","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1452499397909094402","title":"EXCESS MORTALITY RATES ON THE RISE\nhttps://t.co/Y09Qxp7BE5","date":"October 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"増加する過剰死亡率\nhttps://t.co/Y09Qxp7BE5","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"超额死亡率在上升\nhttps://t.co/Y09Qxp7BE5","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"超額死亡率在上升\nhttps://t.co/Y09Qxp7BE5","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qfqmot","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qfqmot/did_i_do_this_right_are_you_proud_of_me_tsla_puts/","title":"Did I do this right?
