Basically, someone said they started buying stocks six months ago and have been in the red since until finally breaking even this week. As a beginner, it’s so difficult, because you’re excited and you understand the market returns 7-10% per year vs. nothing as cash. So six months later, when your carefully selected stocks stink, it feels bad, man.</p>\n\n<p>I am here to tell you to HOLD your ridiculous stock, and to wrap your head around the idea that a LOT of people have been at this for a very long time. Your stocks are doing badly because people years before you thought the same thing you did: this is a great company! And they doubled, tripled, whatevered their money, and are now selling. This results in you having an unrealized loss or reduced unrealized gain that only becomes real IF YOU SELL. But you don’t have to realize it. Because you haven’t lost money. Your stock has simply lost its SHORT-TERM momentum. </p>\n\n<p>One of my recent stinkers has been TSM which I bought at the literal top in February. There are lots of stocks like this in tech, renewables, anything ARK. Same with crypto. And all for the same reason – people are cashing out! An analogy would be sitting at a slot machine right after somebody else just hit the jackpot. Bummer in the short term, but it’s still a good machine! Back to TSM, here’s a scenario: Imagine someone buys at the literal top in January 2018 @ $46. Then the stock drops and is stuck below that for 20 months straight until October 2019 when it finally breaks above $46. From there, it hangs out around the low 50s for several months until July 2020 when it nearly TRIPLES in value peaking above $140 in Feb 21. Sure, the pattern mimics what happened in the broader market, but that’s the point. A TSM holder would be up over 250% today. That&#39;s sure better than 7-10%.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, my human emotion is thinking “boo-hoo, I am still down now while others are doing well.” But that’s not what matters. For most people, buying individual stocks isn’t a game of making a quick buck. It’s a game of being capable, consciously and financially, to wait it out – sometime for years – for these kinds of gains. This concept was never explained to me, but I think it’s an important lesson for beginners so they don’t sell a good thing and get taken advantage of when they miss the rocket emoji.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oh9905/a_word_to_new_investors_hold/","title":"A word to new investors: HOLD!","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-10T02:50:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-10 02:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"74d1dc25-8ac8-5f4a-b339-dcee043050a2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oh9905/a_word_to_new_investors_hold/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oh9905/a_word_to_new_investors_hold/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"MinnesotaPower","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MinnesotaPower","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MinnesotaPower","score":1214,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"新しい投資家に向けての言葉 HOLD!","the_new_excerpt":"最近、ここで読んだ記事について考えてみました。基本的には、誰かが\n半年前に株を買い始めてからずっと赤字だったが、今週ようやく収支がプラスになった。\n今週ようやく収支がプラスになりました。初心者としては、とても難しいことです。\nなぜなら、あなたはワクワクしていて、市場が年に7～10％のリターンを得ることを理解しているからです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"给新投资者的一句话。保持住!","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在想最近在这里看到的一个帖子。基本上，有人说\n他们六个月前开始购买股票，此后一直处于亏损状态，直到本周终于实现收支平衡。\n本周终于实现了收支平衡。作为一个初学者，这太难了，因为\n你很兴奋，你知道市场每年的回报率是7-10%...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"給新投資者的一句話。保持住!","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在想最近在這裏看到的一個帖子。基本上，有人說\n他們六個月前開始購買股票，此後一直處於虧損狀態，直到本週終於實現收支平衡。\n本週終於實現了收支平衡。作爲一個初學者，這太難了，因爲\n你很興奮，你知道市場每年的回報率是7-10%...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9c441531-9068-5081-8aee-eef5559a2926","excerpt":"Average number of days that stocks hit all time high!\n\nI use this stat to help me “stomach” buying at the top.\n\nHave a great weekend boglehead friends!","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/oh7z5d/days_like_today_only_happen_every_20_business/","title":"Days like today only happen every 20 business days.
