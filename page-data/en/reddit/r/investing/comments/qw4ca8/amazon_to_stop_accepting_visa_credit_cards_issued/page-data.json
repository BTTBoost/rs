Users are being encouraged to update their default payment method ahead of the changes.</strong> The news was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-will-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-u-k?srnd=technology-vp\">Bloomberg</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Visa said it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”  </p>\n\n<p>“U.K. shoppers can use their Visa debit and credit cards at Amazon U.K. today and throughout the holiday season,” a Visa spokesperson told CNBC.  </p>\n\n<p>“We have a long-standing relationship with Amazon, and we continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon U.K. without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.”  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon blasted Visa for its high card charges. “The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers,” a spokesperson for the company told CNBC.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>“These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise.”</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The move could be viewed as a way for Amazon to get some bargaining power over Visa to lower its fees. The payments firm also charges businesses scheme fees to become part of its network.  </p>\n\n<p>While smaller retailers aren’t in a position to negotiate, Amazon — given its size — may have better luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/amazon-to-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-uk.html\">CNBC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE\">Visa is down about 5%</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qw4ca8/amazon_to_stop_accepting_visa_credit_cards_issued/","title":"Amazon to stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the UK, citing high fees","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-17T18:33:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-17 18:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qw4ca8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qw4ca8/amazon_to_stop_accepting_visa_credit_cards_issued/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qw4ca8/amazon_to_stop_accepting_visa_credit_cards_issued/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qw1iz3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw1iz3/still_a_gem/","title":"Still a GEM","date":"November 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"まだまだ元気です。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"仍然是一颗宝石","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"仍然是一顆寶石","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qw4ca8","previousId":"RedditPost-qw1iz3","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qw4ca8/amazon_to_stop_accepting_visa_credit_cards_issued/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
