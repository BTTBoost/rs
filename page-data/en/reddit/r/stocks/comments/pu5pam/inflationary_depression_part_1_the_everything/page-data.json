Part 1 will break down the current market and how we got here. Part 2 will explain what we should expect and why we are beginning to see the things we are seeing. Part 3 is how to profit off of the things learned in Parts 1 and 2.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>So how did we get here?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>In March of the United States shut down the economic machine by forcing people into their homes to fend off what seemed at the time to be an extremely severe crisis. This immediately put the US into a store of pent-up demand. In order to hold off an economic collapse the Fed and the Federal government (we will look at them as two separate entities here) sent interest rates to zero, immediately initiated Quantitative Easing (the method the Fed uses to buy bonds as used in the ’08 crisis) while the government began dishing out trillions in stimulus (roughly 3.3 Trillion already paid out, 3.7 trillion obligated and another 1.2 Trillion budgeted).</p>\n\n<p>M2 Supply skyrocketed more than any other time in the past 60 years. From February 2008 to February 2020 M2 increased in historical fashion going from $7.5B to $15.4B which was an increase about in line for previous 12 year periods over the past 30 years (a roughly 6.2% annual increase). From February 2020 to July 2021 M2 has ballooned from $15.4B to $20.5B (a roughly 21% annual increase).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, with easy lending and plenty of cash we began to see debt grow extremely rapidly. Both nationally and among households. Household debt had moved past 2008 levels in Q1 of 2017 and has only been on an upward trajectory since. Although instead of moving into low interest rate housing loans, Americans are taking on more personal loans than ever before. But the US currently isn’t seeing the true burden of this debt as student loan debt payments (the 2nd highest form of debt and the highest form of personal debt) begin in February of next year. This pause on student debt was another inflationary pressure that will continue until the true debt burdens are taken on (roughly 60 billion in interest each year). We have also seen an increase in auto-loans the second highest personal loan type.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>This wasn’t the beginning of our story</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>In 2008 we had the biggest crash in arguably over 100 years as the whole financial institution had collapsed leading to at least 12 years of negative real interest rates with inflation out pacing the interest rate in all but one year.</p>\n\n<p>As inflation takes off, we are seeing the lowest real interest rates we have seen since 1951. What has this led to? A ballooning of Assets and Debt to GDP (discussed more in the next section). With relaxed lending, QE continuing through 2015 from 2008, this has led to the wealth gap that we see today.</p>\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency obviously has been affected by this, along with meme stocks, and stock prices in general. Corporate Debt has skyrocketed at insane levels across the world: China 150%+ of GDP, Japan 120%+ of GDP, America and Britain around 80% of GDP. Of course, this doesn’t bode well for the Chinese property market as I am sure from recent news you can guess where all of their Corporate debt is (Chinese Corporations are borrowing more than Japan’s bubble from the 80s/90s as a % of GDP). Property across the world is sky high.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What are the direct impacts of all this spending?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Stocks have boomed over the last decade with Shiller’s P/E (a good sign of the valuation of the market) beginning to approach the levels of the ’99 bubble burst (it has already passed black Tuesday). This is due to the increased corporate debt and over stimulation from the Fed. Allowing for assets to skyrocket. Stocks have easily outpaced 15% over the past 5 years as well (S&amp;P 500).</p>\n\n<p>New comers are surging into the market en masse. A classic sign of a bubble (due to a majority of newcomers, not all, being relatively uninformed) with over 15% of current investors starting in 2020 (This was seen in the 1920s, 1990s, and mid 2000s). Also in an inflationary bubble good investments become harder to find as incomes rise and debt increases but more capital goes after these investments (stock bubble).</p>\n\n<p>Inflation is a huge impact being felt by the increase in fiscal stimulus and easy lending. As debt has started to move up, we have seen real household income shrink in 2020 (and expect to see a much greater shrink in 2021) as inflation increases. Shortages have come to dominate our future with commodities skyrocketing in price with input good prices while demand has stayed solid due to a lack of action from the Fed. Housing has begun to feel the intense effects of shortages as well. We are only in the beginning stages and it is starting to be seen on 10-Q&#39;s. <em>SIDE NOTE: THE FED DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ASSET PRICES OR DEBT PRICES. THEY CARE ABOUT INFLATION, GDP GROWTH, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.</em> The US can begin to lose its reserve currency status if it allows for inflation to continue for too long as it puts downward pressure on the dollar.</p>\n\n<p>Companies from Procter and Gamble, to FedEx, to Tesla are all being impacted by shortages in everything. Walmart even bought inventory in preparation of more shortages in Q4 of this year. Car prices are flying (although they’ve slowed). I think you get the picture. Because of the Feds incompetent ability to assess for large changes in assets and debt that get passed onto consumers they make the fatal flaw of relying too hard on CPI (Consumer Price Index). This has led to the Fed personally fueling these shortages along with other central banks (Historically almost all central banks abuse this flaw). I will discuss inflation and shortages more in a secondary post.</p>\n\n<p>With Covid taking hold, the United States Government income plummeted but their spending skyrocketed. Already having a high Debt to GDP ratio, the ratio has stormed past any other point in United States history.</p>\n\n<p>And don’t worry the spending doesn’t seem like it will slow down anytime soon. Our one bright spot is that household debt to GDP has slowed down. In inflationary bubbles growth tends to be spurred by debt and in this case it seems to be the United States government debt. It’s not just the US with global debt to GDP raising to 365% of GDP. This leads to another sign of an inflationary bubble: GDP growth of over 4%, well above potential... The US just clocked 6.6% annual GDP growth. And although we don&#39;t have any data since 2019, I am sure foreign inflows are at all time highs.</p>\n\n<p>In inflationary bubbles, you tend to see imports rise faster than exports causing the current account to worsen. This leads to a devaluation in the currency. The US happens to have the largest negative net export situation in over 70 years.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is safe to say that we are in the middle of an inflationary bubble. Now what?</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>So, what should we expect from here?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>In part 2 we will discuss the inflationary depression. Also in part 2 we will discuss the findings in this report and how it relates to what we should expect to see and what is currently being seen. This will discuss bubbles, shortages, inflation, and the impacts of too much fiscal stimulation. In part 3, we will discuss how to make money on the things we expect to see in part 2.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pu5pam/inflationary_depression_part_1_the_everything/","title":"Inflationary Depression (Part 1): The Everything Bubble","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-24T17:13:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-24 17:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pu5pam","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pu5pam/inflationary_depression_part_1_the_everything/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pu5pam/inflationary_depression_part_1_the_everything/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"captnamurica2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/captnamurica2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"captnamurica2","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"インフレ恐慌（その1）。何でもバブル","the_new_excerpt":"アメリカは過去のインフレ恐慌の兆候を示しています。私は\n3つのパートに分けてご紹介します。パート1では、現在の市場と\nパート1では、現在の市場とここまでの経緯を説明します。第2部では、私たちが何を期待すべきか\nなぜこのような現象が起こり始めたのかを説明します。パート3では、どのように...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"通货膨胀的萧条（第一部分）。一切的泡沫","the_new_excerpt":"美国正在显示过去的通货膨胀萧条的迹象。我已经\n创建了一个三部分的系列，将对其进行分解。第一部分将分解\n目前的市场和我们如何走到这一步。第二部分将解释我们应该期待什么\n以及为什么我们开始看到我们正在看到的东西。第三部分是如何...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"通貨膨脹的蕭條（第一部分）。一切的泡沫","the_new_excerpt":"美國正在顯示過去的通貨膨脹蕭條的跡象。我已經\n創建了一個三部分的系列，將對其進行分解。第一部分將分解\n目前的市場和我們如何走到這一步。第二部分將解釋我們應該期待什麼\n以及爲什麼我們開始看到我們正在看到的東西。第三部分是如何...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1441202301515931654","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1441202301515931654","title":"FAUCI IN 2017 SUPREMELY CONFIDENT IN A ONCE EVERY HUNDRED YEARS OUTBREAK NOW https://t.co/h4K1qEMInI","date":"September 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"2017年のfauciは100年に一度の発生に最高の自信を持っていたが、今はhttps://t.co/h4K1qEMInI。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"Fauci在2017年对百年一遇的爆发极有信心，现在https://t.co/h4K1qEMInI","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"Fauci在2017年對百年一遇的爆發極有信心，現在https://t.co/h4K1qEMInI","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pubabb","excerpt":"Let's say that through my investments I made over $75,000.
