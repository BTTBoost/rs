They&#39;ve acquired &quot;917 million in debt and equity financing.&quot; During the short interval that the market has been open, I&#39;ve seen AMC fluctuate from 4.60-something to 4.13. Last time it got this high, it ended up hemorrhaging. That was based on the news of a vaccine, if I recall. But perhaps this rise isn&#39;t quite as much a mirage, as it&#39;s actually on the strength not merely of expectations and hopes, but an actual, tangible financial development.</p>\n\n<p>So, what do you all think? Is AMC stock going to soar or at least make a steady turn around? One thing I&#39;ll say is, they need to actually start putting out movies that bring people to the theaters. And hopefully hammer out exclusive deals that don&#39;t involve sharing with streaming platforms. Godzilla vs Kong is on the horizon and perhaps that can rake in some old-fashioned blockbuster numbers. But they need to start putting tushes in seats somehow.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l4pidq/good_news_from_amc/","title":"Good news from AMC","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T06:55:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 06:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a8d50910-a42f-58ec-b28f-bc0c02c40ee5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l4pidq/good_news_from_amc/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l4pidq/good_news_from_amc/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"AcroyearOfSPartak","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AcroyearOfSPartak","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"AcroyearOfSPartak","score":47,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AMC的好消息","the_new_excerpt":"我相信你们大多数人都听说了，AMC股票今天大涨，原因是有消息说\nAMC已经获得了足够的资金，以维持 \"深陷2021年 \"的局面。\n的文章。他们已经获得了 \"9.17亿的债权和股权融资\"。在这期间。\n市场开盘时间很短，我看到AMC... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC的好消息","the_new_excerpt":"我相信你們大多數人都聽說了，AMC股票今天大漲，原因是有消息說\nAMC已經獲得了足夠的資金，以維持 \"深陷2021年 \"的局面。\n的文章。他們已經獲得了 \"9.17億的債權和股權融資\"。在這期間。\n市場開盤時間很短，我看到AMC... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-41e53e20-6a3d-565c-8085-923d8579ba7c","excerpt":"They've got fantastic financials, and a near monopoly on semiconductor\nproductions with huge tech customers.
