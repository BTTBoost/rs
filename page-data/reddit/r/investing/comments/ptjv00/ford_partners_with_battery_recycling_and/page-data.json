Securing a supply of batteries — or the materials to make them — has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.</p>\n\n<p>Ford alone will require a hefty supply. The company’s global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030, according to the automaker. That is roughly 10 plants’ worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.</p>\n\n<p>“Closing the loop for us in our end-of-life products and allowing those to re-enter the supply chain will help us drive down costs,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s chief operating officer in North America, said during a press briefing. “Of course, it’ll help us reduce the reliance on importing a lot of the materials that we use today when we build the batteries. And then it’ll reduce the mining of raw materials, which is going to be incredibly important in the future as we start to scale on this space.”</p>\n\n<p>All of this, Drake says, will made EVs cheaper and more sustainable.</p>\n\n<p>Redwood Materials recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. The company, which was founded and is led by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, says it can recover, on average, more than 95% of the elements like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.</p>\n\n<p>Redwood then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC’s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses. Redwood’s first automotive partnership was secured earlier this year with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra.</p>\n\n<p>“The risk is that we find ourselves in a situation perhaps a little bit similar to current global semiconductor shortage if we don’t plan ahead, and if we aren’t strategic about the production capacity and the right regions at the right time,” Straubel said during the briefing.  </p>\n\n<p>Under the partnership announced Wednesday, Redwood Materials will initially work with Ford to set up recycling within the automaker’s battery production network and then funnel the recovered raw materials back to the manufacturer to be used in batteries. While Ford didn’t provide specific details, that likely means working with its battery cell supplier SK.</p>\n\n<p>In May, Ford and SK signed an initial agreement to create a joint venture — to be called BlueOvalSK — to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade.</p>\n\n<p>The ultimate aim of the Redwood Materials-Ford partnership is to touch the entire battery lifecycle from recycling production scrap and supplying Ford with materials to creating recycling options for the end-of-life vehicles. That last piece is complex because Ford will no longer own its EVs, many of which will have multiple owners before they’re ready for the scrap heap.</p>\n\n<p>The deal follows a string of announcements in recent months by Redwood Materials. The company recently raised more than $775 million — a round that TechCrunch learned includes $50 million from Ford. (The company initially announced the round was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/\">more than $700 million</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>It also revealed in September plans to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/\">expand its business</a> beyond battery recycling and into the production of critical battery materials at a new million-square-foot factory in the United States. Redwood wants to produce cathodes and anode foils, the building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure.</p>\n\n<p>The factory, for which the company is currently scouting a location, would likely be dedicated to the production of cathodes. Redwood has said it intends for the factory to ramp up to 100 gigawatt hours of capacity to produce cathode material, enough for one million electric vehicles by 2025.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/ford-partners-with-battery-recycling-and-materials-startup-redwood-materials-amid-ev-push/\">https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/ford-partners-with-battery-recycling-and-materials-startup-redwood-materials-amid-ev-push/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ptjv00/ford_partners_with_battery_recycling_and/","title":"Ford partners with battery recycling and materials startup Redwood Materials amid EV push","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-23T02:42:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-23 02:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ptjv00","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ptjv00/ford_partners_with_battery_recycling_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ptjv00/ford_partners_with_battery_recycling_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ILikeTalkn2Myself","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ILikeTalkn2Myself","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ILikeTalkn2Myself","score":227,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"フォード、EV推進のためバッテリーのリサイクルと素材の新興企業Redwood Materials社と提携","the_new_excerpt":"フォード・モーターは、レッドウッド・マテリアルズ社と提携し、同社が開発した\nこのパートナーシップは、生産されたスクラップと使用済みの電気自動車のリサイクルをカバーするものです。\nこのパートナーシップは、生産過程で発生するスクラップや使用済みの電気自動車をリサイクルするだけでなく、電気自動車の製造工程に必要な材料を供給するものです。\nこのパートナーシップは、生産されたスクラップや使用済みの電気自動車のリサイクル、さらには自動車メーカーにバッテリーの原材料を供給することも含みます。\n\nこの契約は、フォードが電気自動車の生産台数を増やすことを目的としています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"福特与电池回收和材料初创公司Redwood Materials合作，推动电动汽车发展","the_new_excerpt":"福特汽车公司已经与红木材料公司合作，为其即将到来的大量电动汽车创建一个闭环系统。\n为其即将到来的电动车大潮创建一个闭环系统--这种合作关系将涵盖回收\n这一合作关系将包括回收生产废料和使用寿命结束后的电动汽车，以及向汽车制造商提供原材料电池。\n汽车制造商提供原始电池材料。\n\n这笔交易是在福特公司增加了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"福特與電池回收和材料初創公司Redwood Materials合作，推動電動汽車發展","the_new_excerpt":"福特汽車公司已經與紅木材料公司合作，爲其即將到來的大量電動汽車創建一個閉環系統。\n爲其即將到來的電動車大潮創建一個閉環系統--這種合作關係將涵蓋回收\n這一合作關係將包括回收生產廢料和使用壽命結束後的電動汽車，以及向汽車製造商提供原材料電池。\n汽車製造商提供原始電池材料。\n\n這筆交易是在福特公司增加了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1440743313431089156","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1440743313431089156","title":"Wall Street strategists warn of more upside ahead.","date":"September 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ウォールストリートのストラテジストたちは、さらなるアップサイドを警告している。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"华尔街策略师警告说，未来会有更多的上升空间。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"華爾街策略師警告說，未來會有更多的上升空間。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ptjbx7","excerpt":"„Amazon said it has “reinstated the employment eligibility” for former workers\nor applicants who were fired or deferred during marijuana screenings.
