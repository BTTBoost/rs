The correction has affected tech the most as the Nasdaq is about 8% from its all time highs.</p>\n\n<p>The correction has happened because of number one: Rising treasury yields and number two: Sector rotation. Reopening plays are currently the trend that big money likes and money has gone there recently. </p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t mean that tech is bad in the long term. Stocks go down sometimes and this is the moment that it’s happening. But there is a silver lining to this story...</p>\n\n<p>This gives us a good opportunity get your favourite stocks at a cheaper price. Averaging down is a very delightful thing to do and this is a perfect opportunity. And even if we continue to go down, it’s ok, since you can average down even more.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing that I want to say is that you shouldn’t listen to the media too much. It’s their job to create havoc and drama in the stock market. Their opinions change every week almost, and it’s kinda funny sometimes. One week they say that you shouldn’t sell and another day CNBC reporters tell us how big tech is in a bad place and you should move to industrials, travel, etc. </p>\n\n<p>You have YOUR own plan. Do your plan and don’t listen to those whose job is to dramatize things. The stock market needs patience. Investing is for the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t look at the 1 day chart all the time. It can be very toxic for yourself, especially during a red day. So just chill and remember that your time horizon is in 10 years, not tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>That’s my 2 cents, have good one everyone!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mdn3nz/tech_is_tanking_at_the_moment_but_it_will_come/","title":"Tech is tanking at the moment, but it will come back up eventually.
