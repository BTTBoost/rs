Alexis Goldstein here. During my testimony before the House Financial Services Committee today, I tried to flag some open questions I have. One of them is, what was the volume of trading in GME (and other meme stocks) by institutional players who, unlike retail, can trade “over the counter” (OTC) options (which they typically still hedge with listed stock). If regulators or Congress has a send of the volumes of OTC options on GME that traded in periods of high volatility, that would give some insight into their overall footprint in the volatility. </p>\n\n<p>I elaborate on this a bit more in my written testimony if you’re interested:  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexisgoldstein/status/1372348772223750144?s=21\">https://twitter.com/alexisgoldstein/status/1372348772223750144?s=21</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-goldsteina-20210317.pdf\">https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-goldsteina-20210317.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>And here are some my other observations about today’s hearing, in case that is also of interest! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexisgoldstein/status/1372355570196480002?s=21\">https://twitter.com/alexisgoldstein/status/1372355570196480002?s=21</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what_was_the_footprint_of_institutional_trading/","title":"What was the footprint of institutional trading in GME?
