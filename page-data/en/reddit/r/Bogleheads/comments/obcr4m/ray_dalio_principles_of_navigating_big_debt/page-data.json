Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone</li>\n<li><strong>Template of a debt crisis</strong></li>\n<li>Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt\n\n<ul>\n<li>Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates</li>\n<li>Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles</li>\n<li>During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk</li>\n<li>Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems</li>\n<li>Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency</li>\n<li>Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency</li>\n<li>Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later</li>\n<li>Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble</li>\n<li>No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929</li>\n<li>During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &quot;bailing out&quot; financial institutions</li>\n<li>Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle</li>\n<li>It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy</li>\n<li>By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other</li>\n<li>Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle</strong></h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &quot;Goldilocks&quot; period</li>\n<li>Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle\n\n<ul>\n<li>Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt</li>\n<li>Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up</li>\n<li>Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble</li>\n<li>As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish</li>\n<li>The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices</li>\n<li>Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets</li>\n<li>Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis</li>\n<li>Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it</li>\n<li>How to Spot a Bubble\n\n<ul>\n<li>Prices are high relative to traditional measures</li>\n<li>Broad bullish sentiment</li>\n<li>Purchases are financed by high leverage</li>\n<li>New buyers enter the market</li>\n<li>Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains</li>\n<li>Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason</li>\n<li>This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious</li>\n<li>Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth</li>\n<li>A negative &quot;wealth effect&quot; occurs when one&#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition</li>\n<li>Yield curve is usually flat or inverted</li>\n<li>People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending</li>\n<li>Unemployment is low</li>\n<li>The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows</li>\n<li>Immediate post bubble period</li>\n<li>People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &quot;cheap&quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past</li>\n<li>Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult</li>\n<li>As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment</li>\n<li>This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The &quot;Depression&quot;\n\n<ul>\n<li>In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%</li>\n<li>The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE – &quot;QE&quot; or printing money or stimulus</li>\n<li>Declines of 50% of people&#39;s assets are common</li>\n<li>As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)</li>\n<li>Runs on banks are common</li>\n<li>At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary</li>\n<li>People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy</li>\n<li>Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against</li>\n<li>If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful</li>\n<li>A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&#39;t real</li>\n<li>Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)</li>\n<li>The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction</li>\n<li>The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &quot;real&quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash</li>\n<li>The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression</li>\n<li>They are typically slow to react initially because they don&#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems</li>\n<li>Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad</li>\n<li>&quot;QE&quot; or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies</li>\n<li>Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.</li>\n<li>Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich</li>\n<li>Stocks usually fall 50%</li>\n<li>Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold</li>\n<li>Deficits widen to 6% of GDP</li>\n<li>Economic activity falls about 10%</li>\n<li>Unemployment is 10-15%</li>\n<li>Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The &quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&quot;\n\n<ul>\n<li>Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way</li>\n<li>Printing money during this phase doesn&#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.</li>\n<li>But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&#39;s and cause a &quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&quot; IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920&#39;s</li>\n<li>Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&#39;t work (IE – Already at 0%)</li>\n<li>All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)</li>\n<li>In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest</li>\n<li>Austerity causes more pain than benefit</li>\n<li>Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast</li>\n<li>Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&#39;t happen without a revolution</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Pushing on a string phase\n\n<ul>\n<li>Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.</li>\n<li>Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets</li>\n<li>The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&quot; to occur</li>\n<li>Monetary Policy 1\n\n<ul>\n<li>Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&#39;t work, they go to 2</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Monetary Policy 2\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;QE&quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE – investors don&#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective</li>\n<li>Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold</li>\n<li>At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020\n\n<ul>\n<li>Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it</li>\n<li>Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Normalization\n\n<ul>\n<li>System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>Inflationary Depression</strong></h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reserve currency countries that don&#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.</li>\n<li>If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle</strong></h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have severe currency weakness. This currency weakness is what causes inflations when there is a depression</li>\n<li>Inflationary Depression can happen to any country but are most likely if\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#39;t have reserve currency</li>\n<li>Have low foreign exchange reserves</li>\n<li>Have large foreign debt</li>\n<li>Have large and increasing budget and/or deficit</li>\n<li>Have negative real interest rates</li>\n<li>History of high inflation</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>5 Stages of debt cycle. Follow the deflationary cycle until the depression stage\n\n<ul>\n<li>Early – Low debt levels. Productive Investments. Attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns. Usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.</li>\n<li>Bubble – Good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle. But debts are rising faster than incomes. Asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt. Country becomes the &quot;hot&quot; place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal. Country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains. Stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase</li>\n<li>Top – Bubble bursts. The inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed. Asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail. Could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices. Worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency. Investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can</li>\n<li>Central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency</li>\n<li>Central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spending down reserves</li>\n<li>Raising rates</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works</li>\n<li>Depression – Policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline. A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn&#39;t good. Most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard. Policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don&#39;t. After policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.</li>\n<li>Usually, 30% decline in the currency</li>\n<li>50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency</li>\n<li>Normalization – Supply demand balance return. Typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3). But the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1><strong>Hyperinflation</strong></h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income. And this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result</li>\n<li>Inflation psychology sets in with the public. Currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop</li>\n<li>People totally lose faith in the currency as a store of value</li>\n<li>How to invest during a hyperinflation episode – Short the currency, get your money out of the country, buy commodities (Gold), and invest in commodity industries (Gold, Oil, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/obcr4m/ray_dalio_principles_of_navigating_big_debt/","title":"Ray Dalio Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises Summary","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"July 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-01T05:45:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-01 05:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f498ca5c-1fb5-5b5a-a3ad-252ba549d631","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/obcr4m/ray_dalio_principles_of_navigating_big_debt/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/obcr4m/ray_dalio_principles_of_navigating_big_debt/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"captmorgan50","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"captmorgan50","score":129,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"レイ・ダリオ 大きな借金の危機を乗り越える原則 まとめ","the_new_excerpt":"RAY DALIO\n\n\n大きな債務危機を乗り越えるための原則\n\n * 政策立案者は、債務に対処する際に4つのレバーを引く必要があります。\n   * 緊縮財政\n   * 債務不履行／リストラクチャリング\n   * 中央銀行がお金を印刷する \"QE\"\n   * 貨幣と信用の移転\n * 最初の2つはデフレ、後の2つは...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"雷-达利欧驾驭大型债务危机的原则摘要","the_new_excerpt":"RAY DALIO\n\n\n驾驭大型债务危机的原则\n\n * 政策制定者在处理债务问题时有4个杠杆可以拉动\n   * 紧缩政策\n   * 债务违约/重组\n   * 中央银行印钞 \"QE\"\n   * 货币和信贷的转移\n * 前两个是通货紧缩，后两个是......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"雷-達利歐駕馭大型債務危機的原則摘要","the_new_excerpt":"RAY DALIO\n\n\n駕馭大型債務危機的原則\n\n * 政策制定者在處理債務問題時有4個槓桿可以拉動\n   * 緊縮政策\n   * 債務違約/重組\n   * 中央銀行印鈔 \"QE\"\n   * 貨幣和信貸的轉移\n * 前兩個是通貨緊縮，後兩個是......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-de0f8118-2e8d-5c7f-aebb-4b4b199e529d","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-dollars-after-causing-users-significant-harm.html\n\nPopular investing platform Robinhood has agreed to pay nearly $70 million to the\nfinancial industry regulatory authority (FINRA) to settle allegations that the\nbrokerage caused customers…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/obdhf3/robinhood_to_pay_70_million_fine_after_causing/","title":"Robinhood to pay $70 million fine after causing ‘widespread and significant harm’ to customers","date":"July 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロビンフッド、顧客に「広範かつ重大な損害」を与えたとして7000万ドルの罰金を支払うことに","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-dollars-after-causing-users-significant-harm.html\n\n人気の投資プラットフォームであるRobinhoodは、金融業界規制当局（FINRA）に約7,000万ドルを支払うことで合意しました。\n疑惑を解決するために、金融業界規制当局（FINRA）に約7,000万ドルを支払うことに合意しました。\n証券会社が顧客に...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对客户造成 \"广泛和重大伤害 \"后，Robinhood将支付7000万美元的罚款","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-dollars-after-causing-users-significant-harm.html\n\n流行的投资平台Robinhood已经同意向金融业监管机构（FINRA）支付近7000万美元的费用，以解决对该平台的指控。\n金融业监管机构（FINRA），以解决对该公司的指控。\n经纪公司导致客户...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對客戶造成 \"廣泛和重大傷害 \"後，Robinhood將支付7000萬美元的罰款","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-dollars-after-causing-users-significant-harm.html\n\n流行的投資平臺Robinhood已經同意向金融業監管機構（FINRA）支付近7000萬美元的費用，以解決對該平臺的指控。\n金融業監管機構（FINRA），以解決對該公司的指控。\n經紀公司導致客戶...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ed4b2af3-4be6-553d-92a4-021ede7a6e88","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obaef8/my_name_is_creamychickencock_and_i_yolo_at_peaks/","title":"My name is CreamyChickenCock, and I yolo at peaks","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 01, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の名前はCreamyChickenCock、ピークスではヨロシクです。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的名字是CreamyChickenCock，我的名字是Yolo at peaks。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的名字是CreamyChickenCock，我的名字是Yolo at peaks。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-f498ca5c-1fb5-5b5a-a3ad-252ba549d631","previousId":"RedditPost-de0f8118-2e8d-5c7f-aebb-4b4b199e529d","nextId":"RedditPost-ed4b2af3-4be6-553d-92a4-021ede7a6e88","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/obcr4m/ray_dalio_principles_of_navigating_big_debt/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
