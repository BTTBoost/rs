The more I save, the quicker I can reach financial independence. In my 20’s I’ve stayed in 100% stocks and have not purchased any bonds. I have a pretty tough skin and risk tolerance and didn’t even consider selling during the short 2020 market crash.</p>\n\n<p>However, I also understand the importance of an emergency fund. I started with around $10,000 in an Ally savings account and have increased it up to $25,000 over the past few years.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, I’ve considered putting most of my emergency fund into I-bonds. I understand they are less liquid than a savings account but in the long run will be less affected by inflation. Looking at historic rates, they almost always are at least 1-2% higher than a high yield savings account.  <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/agSHRni\">https://imgur.com/a/agSHRni</a></p>\n\n<p>The pro to an online savings account is only liquidity and money available within a few days. </p>\n\n<p>From what I can tell about I-bonds the pros and cons are:</p>\n\n<p>Pros:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Higher Inflation Protected Interest Rates</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Cons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Locked up for 1 year from time of purchase.</p></li>\n<li><p>Forfeit 3 months interest if redeemed within 5 years</p></li>\n<li><p>Limited to $10,000 purchased per year </p></li>\n<li><p>May take longer to redeem in an emergency </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think I can deal with all of the cons in my current situation. If I purchase 10k this year and 10k towards the end of next year I could limit my exposure to liquidity issues. My plan would be to buy 10k this December, bring my emergency fund savings account back to 20k by next December, then buy 10k more. At that point I would have 20k in I-bonds and 10k in a savings account. Ideally for small emergencies I wouldn’t even have to touch the I-bonds. Even sacrificing 3 months of interest after 1 year I would still be ahead relative to a high yield savings account. 9 months at an I bond rate beats 12 months at current savings accounts rates.</p>\n\n<p>In the short term, 15k liquidity is plenty. I have a local safety net and could both cover a 6-month lease liability ($3750) and the maximum out of pocket for health insurance ($6500). Worst case I could also move back in with parents and just pay for partial utilities and food. My current industry also has a pretty high demand so it wouldn’t be difficult to get another similar paying job.</p>\n\n<p>One of my main concerns is how difficult it is in practice to redeem I-bonds. Could I put a large emergency expense on a credit card, cash in the same amount of electronic I-bonds the same day, and be able to pay off the credit card within 3 weeks?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qula33/i_bonds_vs_high_yield_savings_account_for/","title":"I Bonds vs High Yield Savings Account for Emergency Fund","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-15T22:25:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-15 22:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qula33","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qula33/i_bonds_vs_high_yield_savings_account_for/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qula33/i_bonds_vs_high_yield_savings_account_for/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"robertjordan7","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/robertjordan7","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"robertjordan7","score":20,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"非常用資金のための社債と高利回り貯蓄口座の比較","the_new_excerpt":"次のような決断に分析的にアプローチしようとしましたが、他の人が同じような決断を経験していないか、私の盲点がないかを確認しています。\n他の人が同じような決断を経験していないか、私の盲点がないかを確認しています。\n\n私はかなり高い貯蓄率を持っており、ドルを非効率的に働かせるのは嫌です。\n非効率に働くお金を残したくありません。貯めれば貯めるほど、早く経済的に余裕ができます。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"I 债券与高收益储蓄账户的应急基金对比","the_new_excerpt":"我已经尝试以分析的方式来处理以下决定，但我想看看其他人是否有类似的决定，或者是否可以帮助我。\n别人是否有类似的决定，或者能否看到我的盲点。\n\n我有一个相当高的储蓄率，讨厌让我的钱在低效率的情况下工作。\n效率低下。我的储蓄越多，我就能越快地达到财务目标。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"I 債券與高收益儲蓄賬戶的應急基金對比","the_new_excerpt":"我已經嘗試以分析的方式來處理以下決定，但我想看看其他人是否有類似的決定，或者是否可以幫助我。\n別人是否有類似的決定，或者能否看到我的盲點。\n\n我有一個相當高的儲蓄率，討厭讓我的錢在低效率的情況下工作。\n效率低下。我的儲蓄越多，我就能越快地達到財務目標。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qukktc","excerpt":"Some third quarter highlights:\n\n * Revenue of $171.1 million, a 49.2% increase compared to $114.7 million in the\n   prior year period\n * Net losses totaled $41.2 million, or 7 cents per share, after a loss of $10.4\n   million, or 2 cents per share, last year.\n * Gross profit of $44.9 million, or a…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qukktc/oatly_shares_down_20_after_earnings_expecting/","title":"Oatly Shares Down 20% After Earnings, Expecting Lower Revenue for 2022.","date":"November 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Oatly社の株価は決算後に20％下落、2022年の収益低下を予想。","the_new_excerpt":"第3四半期のハイライトをいくつかご紹介します。\n\n * 売上高は171.1百万ドルで、前年同期の114.7百万ドルに比べて49.2％増加しました。\n   49.2％の増加\n * 純損失は、前年同期の10.4百万ドル（1株当たり2セント）から、41.2百万ドル（1株当たり7セント）になりました。\n   純損失は41.2百万ドル（1株あたり7セント）となりました。\n * 売上総利益は44.9百万ドル、1...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Oatly股价在盈利后下跌20%，预计2022年收入减少。","the_new_excerpt":"第三季度的一些亮点。\n\n * 收入为1.711亿美元，比去年同期的1.147亿美元增长49.2%。\n   收入为1.711亿美元，比上年同期的1.147亿美元增长49.2%。\n * 净亏损总额为4120万美元，或每股7美分，此前亏损为10.4美元\n   去年亏损1040万美元，或每股2美分。\n * 毛利润为4490万美元，或每股1美分。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Oatly股價在盈利後下跌20%，預計2022年收入減少。","the_new_excerpt":"第三季度的一些亮點。\n\n * 收入爲1.711億美元，比去年同期的1.147億美元增長49.2%。\n   收入爲1.711億美元，比上年同期的1.147億美元增長49.2%。\n * 淨虧損總額爲4120萬美元，或每股7美分，此前虧損爲10.4美元\n   去年虧損1040萬美元，或每股2美分。\n * 毛利潤爲4490萬美元，或每股1美分。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qupfzp","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qupfzp/alibaba_limp_dick_pattern_bout_to_erect/","title":"Alibaba, limp dick pattern bout to erect!!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 15, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アリババ、ぐにゃぐにゃチンポのパターンが勃ちそう！？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"阿里巴巴，软趴趴的小弟弟模式要竖起来了！!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"阿里巴巴，軟趴趴的小弟弟模式要豎起來了！!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qula33","previousId":"RedditPost-qukktc","nextId":"RedditPost-qupfzp","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qula33/i_bonds_vs_high_yield_savings_account_for/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
