I own a small cardboard box factory that I inherited from my parents 2 years ago. Before I took over, the business was on a decline since my parents were getting too tired to manage the business. I only found out a few months later that the company had like $500k worth of debt so I felt extremely discouraged to continue the business. Fortunately, luck was on my side and the business started growing after maybe a year of me taking over. As of now, the debt has all been paid and I&#39;m looking to invest all of my savings into an index fund that will generate 7-10% a year over a long period of time. The reason why I&#39;m choosing index fund over other methods is because I feel like I already have a good stream of income and I want to &quot;secure&quot; it and slowly build up my wealth. I don&#39;t need to take any high risks since I can probably reach my goal within 10-15 years through the company income alone. But anything can happen and I&#39;m a little bit scared any uncertainty that may happen to my business in the future. Maybe one day something bad will happen and then *POOF* there goes my business. In order to prevent me from going broke, my goal now is to have some amount put into an index fund and after 15 years, start withdrawing maybe 2-3% from it annually. My question is, after I stop putting more money in, will that money deplete as time goes by for let&#39;s say 50 years in future or do you guys think it has a high chance of growing even more? Sorry for the long post!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/plmauf/what_are_the_chances_of_my_money_growing_if_i/","title":"What are the chances of my money growing if I only withdraw less than 3 percent annually after I retire?","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"September 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-11T00:47:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-11 00:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"plmauf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/plmauf/what_are_the_chances_of_my_money_growing_if_i/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/plmauf/what_are_the_chances_of_my_money_growing_if_i/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"HomelessMiner","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HomelessMiner","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"HomelessMiner","score":25,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"退職後、毎年3％以下の引き出ししかしない場合、お金が増える可能性はどのくらいですか？","the_new_excerpt":"皆さんに少しでも参考になればと思います。私は24歳のタイ人で、タイに住んでいます。私は、両親から受け継いだ\n2年前に両親から受け継いだ小さなダンボール工場を経営しています。私が引き継ぐ前\n私が引き継ぐ前は、両親が疲弊していたため、事業は衰退していました。\n私が引き継ぐ前は、両親が経営に疲れていたこともあり、経営が悪化していました。その数ヶ月後に知ったのですが...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如果我退休后每年只提取不到3%的资金，我的资金增长的机会有多大？","the_new_excerpt":"给你们提供一些背景。我是一个24岁的泰国人，住在泰国。我拥有一个两年前从父母那里继承的\n两年前我从我父母那里继承了一家小纸箱厂。在我接手之前\n在我接手之前，由于我的父母太过劳累，生意一直在下滑。\n疲于管理业务。几个月后，我才发现...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果我退休後每年只提取不到3%的資金，我的資金增長的機會有多大？","the_new_excerpt":"給你們提供一些背景。我是一個24歲的泰國人，住在泰國。我擁有一個兩年前從父母那裏繼承的\n兩年前我從我父母那裏繼承了一家小紙箱廠。在我接手之前\n在我接手之前，由於我的父母太過勞累，生意一直在下滑。\n疲於管理業務。幾個月後，我才發現...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-plozsy","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/plozsy/our_lord_and_saviour_jpow/","title":"Our Lord and Saviour, JPOW 🙏","date":"September 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私たちの主であり、救世主であるJPOW🙏。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们的主和救世主，JPOW🙏","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們的主和救世主，JPOW🙏","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-plkkct","excerpt":"Every week I see headlines of how the stock market is overvalued and we're\nheading for a crash.
