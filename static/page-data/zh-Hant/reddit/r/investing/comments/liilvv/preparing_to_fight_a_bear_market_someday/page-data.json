Sometimes weeks to months (Covid in February - March of 2020) and sometimes a number of years (August 2000 - March 2003). My portfolio was reduced quite a bit between 2000 and 2003. I held on, rode it down, and back up.</p>\n\n<p>Just like earthquakes, fires, and floods, it&#39;s good to think through a plan before the event comes. What&#39;s your plan to make it through a bear market?</p>\n\n<p>Some presumably wise investors like having some cash on the side to pickup bargains during downturns. Some did that during the Covid drop. There are others that would either short the overall market on the way down, or buy inverse ETF&#39;s (ProShares for example. <em>Side note</em>: holding leveraged inverse funds for a long period of time, even a few days, can lead to unpredictable results due to decay.) If you have a longer time horizon until retirement, riding it down and back up would likely be better than selling at some point and missing the rebound.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s your plan?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/liilvv/preparing_to_fight_a_bear_market_someday/","title":"Preparing to fight a bear (market) someday","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T05:43:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 05:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b2f70bdb-9320-5714-9e01-1ffe365e5ca6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/liilvv/preparing_to_fight_a_bear_market_someday/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/liilvv/preparing_to_fight_a_bear_market_someday/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"SeanVo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SeanVo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SeanVo","score":62,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"准备有朝一日与熊（市场）抗衡。","the_new_excerpt":"在过去的10多年里，市场给很多投资组合带来了巨大的增长。\n年，这是一个美妙的旅程。我已经练就了像样的识别技能\n板块的青睐，买入并持有低成本的指数基金和行业\nETF的关注科技创新。\n\n长期图表的市场...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"準備有朝一日與熊（市場）抗衡。","the_new_excerpt":"在過去的10多年裏，市場給很多投資組合帶來了巨大的增長。\n年，這是一個美妙的旅程。我已經練就了像樣的識別技能\n板塊的青睞，買入並持有低成本的指數基金和行業\nETF的關注科技創新。\n\n長期圖表的市場...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-09c52ae4-d6a3-52aa-ac91-7d15ab9e8fa8","excerpt":"So Iv came across something interesting whilst reading about BlackBerry’s\ncurrent CEO John S Chen.\n\nFrom his wiki\n\n“Chen became CEO of Sybase in 1998.[12] As Sybase had been a strong competitor\nof Oracle, but had become a \"dead company\" after failing to enter the market for\nenterprise applications,…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lioyoz/reading_into_blackberrys_bb_ceo/","title":"Reading into Blackberry’s (BB) CEO","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"读懂黑莓(BB)的CEO","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我在阅读黑莓的时候发现了一些有趣的事情。\n现任CEO陈俊生。\n\n来自他的wiki\n\n\"1998年，陈建国成为Sybase的CEO。\"[12]由于Sybase曾是一个强大的竞争对手。\n的甲骨文公司，但在进入市场失败后，已经成为一家 \"死公司\"，为。\n企业应用，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"讀懂黑莓(BB)的CEO","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我在閱讀黑莓的時候發現了一些有趣的事情。\n現任CEO陳俊生。\n\n來自他的wiki\n\n\"1998年，陳建國成爲Sybase的CEO。\"[12]由於Sybase曾是一個強大的競爭對手。\n的甲骨文公司，但在進入市場失敗後，已經成爲一家 \"死公司\"，爲。\n企業應用，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c407f4fe-2095-5ae0-95da-c29cef3336b0","excerpt":"If your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my\npersonal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as\nthe following:\n\n * How old are you?
