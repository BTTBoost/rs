Documents, spreadsheets, and presentations have been used for centuries if not millenniums and we will continue to use these methods of communication for centuries more. PLUS the shift to cloud is driving demand for their cloud offering Azure (50% growth in one year). It&#39;s intelligent cloud segment revenues grew 23%+ a year and quickly gaining market share. Ever since they pivoted to SaaS, their revenue and earnings have been stable and increasing so consistently - it&#39;s beautiful. Businesses will always choose Microsoft!</p>\n\n<p>Apple relies more heavily on consumer products and its total revenue and earnings haven&#39;t grown that much since 2015. What’s next after the iPhone? Car? Glasses? We&#39;re betting on them innovating in a massive way. But can they replicate the vision and innovation of Steve Jobs? Many men and women have tried... Only person doing it right now is Elon Musk. But that&#39;s besides the point.</p>\n\n<p>Check this out - financials support Microsoft as a better growth company than Apple.</p>\n\n<p>2015 to 2020 Revenue (June 2015 to Present): \n$MSFT - $93.6B to $153B (+64.5% - $59.4B growth) $AAPL - $233.7 to $294B (+25.8% - $60.3B growth)</p>\n\n<p>2015 to 2020 EBITDA (June 2015 to Present): \n$MSFT - $33.6B to $71.7B (+113% - $38.1B growth) $AAPL - $77.9B to $85.1B (+9.2% - $10.5B growth)</p>\n\n<p>2015 to 2020 Operating Profit Margin (June 2015 to Present): \n$MSFT - 19.4% to 33.4% (+72%)\n$AAPL - 30.2% to 21.7% (-28%)</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft is a cash cow and sales and profits are increasing at double digit rates. Apple is even more of a cash cow but sales and profits are slowing. Microsoft has a new core offering (Azure). Apple does not (yet). Numbers don&#39;t lie. Microsoft is a better growth play than Apple.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mc9dbs/change_my_mind_msft_is_a_better_growth_play_that/","title":"Change My Mind - $MSFT is a better growth play that $AAPL","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T02:43:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 02:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"32253387-0a3f-5a99-a071-bf9e72403bbc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mc9dbs/change_my_mind_msft_is_a_better_growth_play_that/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mc9dbs/change_my_mind_msft_is_a_better_growth_play_that/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"IHBC","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/IHBC","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"IHBC","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"改变我的想法 - $MSFT比$AAPL更好的成长游戏","the_new_excerpt":"如果我为退休后的投资，比如说40年后，我就会押注于\n微软比苹果更多。\n\n微软垄断了商业世界，并拥有基于订阅的。\n商业模式与产品是永恒的（Word，Excel，PowerPoint）。\n文档、电子表格和演示文稿都有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"改變我的想法 - $MSFT比$AAPL更好的成長遊戲","the_new_excerpt":"如果我爲退休後的投資，比如說40年後，我就會押注於\n微軟比蘋果更多。\n\n微軟壟斷了商業世界，並擁有基於訂閱的。\n商業模式與產品是永恆的（Word，Excel，PowerPoint）。\n文檔、電子表格和演示文稿都有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d652816c-a3d6-5acb-aa47-0fb89350068b","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 24, 2021\n\nStocks traded mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) falling while the\nDow Jones (DIA) modestly rose as market participants continue to monitor the\nTreasury yield and the coronavirus situation in Europe.
