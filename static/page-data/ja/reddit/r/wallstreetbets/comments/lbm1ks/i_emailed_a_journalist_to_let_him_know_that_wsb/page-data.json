I&#39;m sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn&#39;t understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don&#39;t consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I&#39;m CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I&#39;m not trying to demean your work in any way. \nHope you have nice day, all the best. \nYours, Jordan. </p>\n\n<p>P.S I really appreciate that your email address is on your article because even if I don&#39;t get a reply it makes you seem very easy to contact... A feature not shared with a lot of journalists. So thank you! </p>\n\n<p>His response: </p>\n\n<p>jordan</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your email. I want to report the truth as accurate as possible. So your email helps me clarify what is really going on. I did join the site over the weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Gary Wagner</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s send journalists some love and welcome them because we need all the help we can get against MSM</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbm1ks/i_emailed_a_journalist_to_let_him_know_that_wsb/","title":"I emailed a journalist to let him know that WSB is NOT buying silver.
