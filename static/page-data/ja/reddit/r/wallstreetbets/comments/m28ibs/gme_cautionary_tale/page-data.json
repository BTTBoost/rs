Remove your fucking stop losses how the fuck does this need to be said. Why are you letting a robot 📄 🙌🏻 for you?</p>\n\n<p>2.) Half of y’all are fucking gods who bought the dip, and got a damn STEAL on some guaranteed lottery tickets 💰💰💰</p>\n\n<p>3.) The other half of y’all weren’t actually waiting on a dip (even though you guys spam it for upvotes like fucking degenerate gremlins) and pussied out when it was time our time to put our NUTS on the hedgies chin. 🌰🌰🌰</p>\n\n<p>The actual important shit:</p>\n\n<p>1.) They are running out of ammo, those drops had fuck all volume behind them. That short attack topped any of the previous attacks, even going back to January. They’re running out of short volume and they know it. We are (for real this time) in the endgame.</p>\n\n<p>2.) CNBC and other shill outlets are tightly gagged, we are seeing tangibly less coverage across the board than at this far up in the share price a month ago. Only rarely to be released to revel in any tiny downtick of the share price. This is for a reason. Last time everybody was shitting themselves over GME, it was everywhere. And because of this, MANY retail investors hopped on the train and sucked up a lot of volume in a short period, hence the silence now. This is potentially a good thing because it means no influx of uneducated monkeys who know jack shit.</p>\n\n<p>3.) We need educate new members of this fuck wagon on what is going on. IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: NEWBIES! YOU’LL KNOW WHEN THE SQUEEZE IS HAPPENING! IT WILL FUCKING SKYROCKET *$5000+ MINIMUM. DONT SELL (unless you have to I know everyone has varying circumstances) DONT BUY UNLESS YOURE READY FOR A HIGH VOLATILITY STOCK. SHIT GOES UP DOWN BACK FORWARD, FUCKING BACKFLIPS. Stop asking stupid shit and hold on</p>\n\n<p>TLDR; Remove your stop losses. Weaponize the newly born apes. Everything has led to now. The media has sorta fucked off, paper hands are long gone. The shorts have one bullet in the gun and they’re saving it to shoot themselves in the mouth. Hang on and have fun. Love you apes </p>\n\n<p>I’m not a cat, I’m an ape.\nThis is not financial advice. \n🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Edit: ok fuck 5k minimum</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: get clickbaited lul. GO SET LIMIT BUYS STOP GIVING AWARDS HAHAHA THANKS BUT FUCK</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m28ibs/gme_cautionary_tale/","title":"GME Cautionary Tale","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-11T19:21:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-11 19:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f020e18a-7fa2-5105-a34c-cdfbe2b61428","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m28ibs/gme_cautionary_tale/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m28ibs/gme_cautionary_tale/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"itsacetheflowerboy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/itsacetheflowerboy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"itsacetheflowerboy","score":6476,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME警示录","the_new_excerpt":"今天的蘸料真他妈好吃，但也让我们学到了一些东西。\n\n1.) 撤掉你他妈的止损，这他妈怎么还需要说。为什么要这样说呢？\n你是让机器人📄🙌🏻给你吗？\n\n2.) 一半的人都是他妈的神谁买了浸，并得到了一个该死的STEAL的\n一些保证彩票...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME警示錄","the_new_excerpt":"今天的蘸料真他媽好喫，但也讓我們學到了一些東西。\n\n1.) 撤掉你他媽的止損，這他媽怎麼還需要說。爲什麼要這樣說呢？\n你是讓機器人📄🙌🏻給你嗎？\n\n2.) 一半的人都是他媽的神誰買了浸，並得到了一個該死的STEAL的\n一些保證彩票...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3ff23c49-5eca-528b-8c20-ff153d973e76","excerpt":"holy moly! holy moly? ... holy moly.","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2uy4f/gme_megathread_part_2_for_march_11_2021/","title":"GME Megathread Part 2 for March 11, 2021","date":"March 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2021年3月11日的GME Megathread第二部分。","the_new_excerpt":"我的天啊，我的天啊？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年3月11日的GME Megathread第二部分。","the_new_excerpt":"我的天啊，我的天啊？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a16f1061-2b87-554b-a7a5-f4e47ece9e1a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2rgaj/gme_hey_bitch_do_you_want_to_make_some_fucking/","title":"GME - Hey bitch do you want to make some fucking money?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 11, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"嘿，婊子，你想赚点钱吗？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"嘿，婊子，你想賺點錢嗎？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-f020e18a-7fa2-5105-a34c-cdfbe2b61428","previousId":"RedditPost-3ff23c49-5eca-528b-8c20-ff153d973e76","nextId":"RedditPost-a16f1061-2b87-554b-a7a5-f4e47ece9e1a","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m28ibs/gme_cautionary_tale/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
