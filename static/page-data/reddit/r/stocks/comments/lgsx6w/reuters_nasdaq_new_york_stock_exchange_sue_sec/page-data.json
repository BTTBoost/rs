The plan “would make equity markets overly complex and increase hidden costs for investors”, the statement said.</p>\n\n<p>The filings were made in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Of Columbia Circuit.</p>\n\n<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Cboe Global Markets, which operates the Chicago Board Options Exchange, was also suing the SEC over the issue.
