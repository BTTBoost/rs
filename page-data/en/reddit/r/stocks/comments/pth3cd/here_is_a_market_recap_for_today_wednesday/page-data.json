As I have said repeatedly, I remain unconcerned by the tapering of quantitative easing, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed begins raising the interest rate sometime in the coming 1-2 years. Glad to see the market avoid a taper tantrum today. </p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has previously communicated to the market that the timing of a so-called taper “will not be intended to carry a direct signal” on the timing of eventual rate hikes. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has been absorbing about $120 billion a month in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. But Fed officials have said in recent weeks that by the end of the year, the economy will likely make the “substantial further progress” indicated last December needed for the central bank to begin slowing the pace of those purchases.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the full transcript: <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>The Fed signaled, “Participants generally view that as long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate”. </p>\n\n<p>In other news, during remarks following the release of the the meeting, Powell promised to make changes to the central bank’s rules on members trading securities. e added that he was not aware of the controversial trades made by Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in 2020 prior to media reports over the past month.</p>\n\n<p>“We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that’s why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” - Benjamin Franklin</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pth3cd/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, September 22, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-23T01:20:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-23 01:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pth3cd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pth3cd/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pth3cd/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":164,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本日、2021年9月22日（水）のMarket Recapをご紹介します。","the_new_excerpt":"サイコ・マーケット・レビュー - 2021年9月22日（水\n\n今日の市場は反発し、今年最長の連勝記録を更新した。\n米国でのエバーグランデ懸念が緩和され、市場参加者は\n米国のEvergrandeの懸念が緩和され、市場参加者は米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の9月の金融政策会合のコメントを消化した。\nこれは、米国のEvergrande懸念が緩和されたことや、市場参加者が9月の連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の金融政策会合でのコメントを消化したことによる。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"以下是今天的市场回顾，2021年9月22日，星期三","the_new_excerpt":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年9月22日，星期三\n\n今天市场反弹，打破了今年以来最长的连跌纪录。\n由于美国的恒大恐惧有所缓解，市场参与者\n消化了美联储9月货币政策会议的评论。\n这表明...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是今天的市場回顧，2021年9月22日，星期三","the_new_excerpt":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年9月22日，星期三\n\n今天市場反彈，打破了今年以來最長的連跌紀錄。\n由於美國的恆大恐懼有所緩解，市場參與者\n消化了美聯儲9月貨幣政策會議的評論。\n這表明...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ptk4mf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ptk4mf/this_sub_when_someone_mentions_qqq/","title":"This sub when someone mentions QQQ","date":"September 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"誰かがQQQに言及した時のこのサブ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"当有人提到QQQ时，这个子","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當有人提到QQQ時，這個子","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pthwf5","excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/blackberry-beats-quarterly-revenue-expectations-on-cybersecurity-boost/ar-AAOIohe?ocid=uxbndlbing\n\n(Reuters) -Canada's BlackBerry Ltd beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter\nrevenue on Wednesday as hybrid working trends drove demand for its…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pthwf5/blackberry_beats_quarterly_revenue_expectations/","title":"BlackBerry beats quarterly revenue expectations on cybersecurity boost.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 23, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ブラックベリー社、サイバーセキュリティの強化により四半期の収益予想を上回る。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/blackberry-beats-quarterly-revenue-expectations-on-cybersecurity-boost/ar-AAOIohe?ocid=uxbndlbing\n\n(ロイター) -カナダのBlackBerry Ltd.は水曜日、第2四半期の売上高がウォール街の予想を上回った。\n水曜日、カナダのBlackBerry Ltd.は、ハイブリッド・ワーキング・トレンドが同社の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"黑莓公司因网络安全的提升而超越季度收入预期。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/blackberry-beats-quarterly-revenue-expectations-on-cybersecurity-boost/ar-AAOIohe?ocid=uxbndlbing\n\n(路透社）--加拿大黑莓有限公司第二季度业绩超出华尔街预期。\n周三的收入超过了华尔街的预期，因为混合工作的趋势推动了对其产品的需求...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"黑莓公司因網絡安全的提升而超越季度收入預期。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/blackberry-beats-quarterly-revenue-expectations-on-cybersecurity-boost/ar-AAOIohe?ocid=uxbndlbing\n\n(路透社）--加拿大黑莓有限公司第二季度業績超出華爾街預期。\n週三的收入超過了華爾街的預期，因爲混合工作的趨勢推動了對其產品的需求...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pth3cd","previousId":"RedditPost-ptk4mf","nextId":"RedditPost-pthwf5","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pth3cd/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
