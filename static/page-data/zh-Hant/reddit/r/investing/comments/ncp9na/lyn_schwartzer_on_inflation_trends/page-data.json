I notice some people don&#39;t like the website, which is fine, but this woman could write for Forbes or academic journals etc. if she wanted to do so, in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The article looks at inflation, money supply, international responses to inflation, and its effects on different classes of people. It also touches on how different asset classes may play out under different conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Of note is her conclusion that people who scream hyperinflation are farcically wrong, but she also notes when short term heavy inflation rears its head it stays on and doesn&#39;t dissipate. Say, if 5% inflation happens one year, it remains, even if it doesn&#39;t feature heavier inflation going further. Like many things in investing, the likely outcome is the middle road.</p>\n\n<p>She also points out how the macro economy may be trending more towards labor over capital. Overall I think such effects would balance out, as better wages and cheaper equities seem great to me personally, although she doesn&#39;t delve very far into the thought.</p>\n\n<p>My portfolio is equity REIT heavy so I especially liked her explanation of how real estate does okay with both higher inflation and higher interest rates, contrary to popular belief. Entry point is key--fixed rate debt is of course the best to have in an inflationary environment. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Interest rates: When interest rates rise, it puts downward pressure on most asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1970s. When interest rates remain low, then monetary inflation remains a decent environment for asset prices, as we saw in the inflationary decade of the 1940s from the market bottom in 1942.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Pendulum swings: Whenever the balance of power favors the wealthy, due to some combination of offshoring, automation, and the political environment, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into asset price inflation. Whenever the balance of power shifts towards labor, due to labor onshoring, labor organization, and/or populist politics gaining a foothold, then monetary inflation is more likely to translate into consumer price inflation. This is largely correlated to wage increases or lack thereof, as well as being correlated to the size and scope of government transfer payments and tax policy.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Inflation: During periods of moderate to high inflation, gold and commodities tend to do extremely well. Equities outperform bonds more often than not, but it depends on the type of equities and their starting valuations, and therefore have a huge variance. Real estate does well, mainly because leverage attached to it gets melted away from inflation. Bonds do poorly in inflationary environments.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Deflationary shock: If temporary deflation is caused by a deflationary shock, such as a recession or depression, bonds are the place to be, and outperform everything else. Gold also generally does fine compared to other assets. Stocks and commodities usually perform very poorly.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Productive deflation or disinflation: Bonds and stocks do well in goldilocks periods of strong real growth, with low inflation and high productivity gains. Between the two, stocks can do better. Commodities and gold are prone to poor performance in this type of environment.\nMy base case going forward continues to be that with the combination of sizable broad money supply growth, along with public opinion pushing the pendulum back away from globalization, consumer price inflation is likely to be higher in the 2020s decade than in the 2010s decade.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>These points may be common knowledge to some, but I found it informative. Consumer price inflation is pretty identical to what we think of as &quot;inflation,&quot; so it seems fair to submit inflation will be higher than we are used to but not catastrophic or anything. So, for me, I like to think my REITs, most of which have pretty strong rent escalators linked to CPI (up to 3% annually with base increase no matter what), will do fine over a multi-year period. </p>\n\n<p>I hate precious metals since I don&#39;t really think of them as hard assets--it&#39;s just a series of price quotes to most people who hold it--there is some correlation to real estate. Consider how the ticker LAND had pretty extreme outperformance compared to its own asset class during 2020 which is still ongoing since that REIT focuses on owning specialty crop farmland with water rights. It outperformed gold swiftly, yet probably appeals to the same kind of buyer and pays cash dividends. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d also like to remind people many REITs invest in free-standing properties on a triple net basis and that retail stores are still opening up en masse, largely among discount retailers which easily co-exist with internet commerce in poorer areas (think Dollar General, which works with companies like Instacart). Even with covid there was no retail apocalypse among corporate discount retailers. Most of these lease to REITs and pay a good deal of rent.</p>\n\n<p>It may also be worthwhile to consider that with higher than usual inflation comes a risk of higher than usual interest rates being implemented, again, not to a catastrophic scare mongering level. Financials that focus on offering floating rate loans may do well over the coming years. Burry recently invested a good deal of money in a multi-cycle weathered business development company, Ares Capital, which would organically benefit from even minor rate hikes.</p>\n\n<p>I think the best thing I pulled from the article is: don&#39;t worry so much. Inflation will happen, but it won&#39;t be insane. Perhaps focus less on long duration equities, ie. very high multiple tech corporations, and at least consider adding assets that are more down to Earth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ncp9na/lyn_schwartzer_on_inflation_trends/","title":"Lyn Schwartzer on Inflation Trends","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-16T02:46:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-16 02:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0ded7439-c4f5-5bf3-beaf-ef197f7773f0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ncp9na/lyn_schwartzer_on_inflation_trends/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ncp9na/lyn_schwartzer_on_inflation_trends/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ThemChecks","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThemChecks","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ThemChecks","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"リン・シュワルツァー氏が語る「インフレの動向","the_new_excerpt":"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4426754-investing-with-inflation-150-years-data\n\nシークリング・アルファについて何とでも言えますが、このライターは一般的に最も分析的なライターと考えられています。\nこの作家は、最も分析的な作家であり、決して彼女のチームの仕事をSeeking Alphaに限定しているわけではありません。\nAlphaに限定しているわけではありません。私は、何人かの人々がこのウェブサイトを好きではないことに気づきました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"林-施瓦茨谈通货膨胀趋势","the_new_excerpt":"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4426754-investing-with-inflation-150-years-data\n\n说说你对Seeking Alpha的看法，但这位作者被普遍认为是\n最具分析力的作者，而且她的团队的工作绝不局限于Seeking\n阿尔法。我注意到有些人不喜欢这个网站，这...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"林-施瓦茨談通貨膨脹趨勢","the_new_excerpt":"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4426754-investing-with-inflation-150-years-data\n\n說說你對Seeking Alpha的看法，但這位作者被普遍認爲是\n最具分析力的作者，而且她的團隊的工作絕不侷限於Seeking\n阿爾法。我注意到有些人不喜歡這個網站，這...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1393642540373614599","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1393642540373614599","title":"Does @elonmusk think his Tesla cars aren’t powered by the same shit BTC is?
