I followed the Motley Fool advice of buying a company called Lemonade (LMND). It was recommended at around $140 and I bought up a bundle of shares. It dropped to almost $80 within days and has hardly broken $100 in weeks. After reading some additional DD from other Redditors, their summary that Lemonade will simply be out leveraged in an already stiff market makes sense. Being new to investing, I made the mistake of buying quickly and not following research. Just for anybody else&#39;s sake, please don&#39;t make the mistake of buying LMND. It&#39;s complete garbage and would be surprised if I break even again with the initial investment.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m72whn/your_worst_picks_for_the_last_30_days/","title":"Your worst picks for the last 30 days","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T20:58:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 20:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"efdd75a0-ed6a-5970-8acb-a80b4ca1a64c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m72whn/your_worst_picks_for_the_last_30_days/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m72whn/your_worst_picks_for_the_last_30_days/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"A_Postal_Worker","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/A_Postal_Worker","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"A_Postal_Worker","score":143,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你过去30天最差的选择","the_new_excerpt":"看了本月至今的股票表现，我有一个明确的认识。\n赢家 我听从Motley Fool的建议，买了一家叫Lemonade的公司。\n(LMND)。它的推荐价格在140美元左右，我买了一捆股票。它\n几天内跌至近80美元，几乎没有突破100美元，在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你過去30天最差的選擇","the_new_excerpt":"看了本月至今的股票表現，我有一個明確的認識。\n贏家 我聽從Motley Fool的建議，買了一家叫Lemonade的公司。\n(LMND)。它的推薦價格在140美元左右，我買了一捆股票。它\n幾天內跌至近80美元，幾乎沒有突破100美元，在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1372252916615090178","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1372252916615090178","title":"\"IRS Said to Delay Tax-Filing Deadline Until Mid-May\"\n\nWhy do we even need taxes anymore when we can just borrow the money and have the Fed buy that debt?","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"\"据说国税局将把报税截止日期推迟到5月中旬\"\n\n既然我们可以直接借钱，让美联储买下这些债务，那为什么还需要税收呢？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"\"據說國稅局將把報稅截止日期推遲到5月中旬\"\n\n既然我們可以直接借錢，讓美聯儲買下這些債務，那爲什麼還需要稅收呢？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-f570caae-ea24-5129-9bef-f1463135fbb0","excerpt":"I believe in the apes\n[https://preview.redd.it/wm9yphariln61.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c70b7678fe5f9097fb10f89fca5c7b89c0ade4]","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m718f8/yolod_all_my_savings_10k_wife_doesnt_know_yet/","title":"YOLO'd all my savings 10k , wife doesnt know yet...","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我所有的积蓄都被YOLO掉了，老婆还不知道......","the_new_excerpt":"我相信人猿的存在\n[https://preview.redd.it/wm9yphariln61.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c70b7678fe5f9097fb10f89fca5c7b89c0ade4]","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我所有的積蓄都被YOLO掉了，老婆還不知道......","the_new_excerpt":"我相信人猿的存在\n[https://preview.redd.it/wm9yphariln61.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c70b7678fe5f9097fb10f89fca5c7b89c0ade4]","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-efdd75a0-ed6a-5970-8acb-a80b4ca1a64c","previousId":"TweetPost-1372252916615090178","nextId":"RedditPost-f570caae-ea24-5129-9bef-f1463135fbb0","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m72whn/your_worst_picks_for_the_last_30_days/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
