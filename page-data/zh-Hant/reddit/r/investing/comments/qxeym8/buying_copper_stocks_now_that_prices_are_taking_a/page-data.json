The situation is still volatile but I am planning to buy copper stocks because of the dip knowing that the demand for copper will just keep on increasing.</p>\n\n<p>I have already placed some in<a href=\"http://www.southerncoppercorp.com/\"> Southern Copper Corporation</a> (SCCO) since they are paying a dividend of $2.70 per share. I’m thinking of placing in Fortitude Gold, since they’re also paying a dividend which they just increased recently.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also into getting some juniors seeing how these companies might have some future once the demand for copper increases even more. I’m thinking of getting <a href=\"https://cumtn.com/\">Copper Mountain Mining</a> (CMMC), since they are already producing approximately 100 million pounds of copper equivalent. <a href=\"https://www.threevalleycopper.com/\">Three Valley Copper</a> (TVC) is also promising especially after their upsize with a recent deal financing up to $16 million. Their second quarter results are also remarkable and they are expected to start annual production by the end of next year.</p>\n\n<p>The copper demand is rising and will probably increase and even double in the next few years so I’m taking my chance on this metal. I didn’t put much anyways since I’m making sure I only invest the money I know I might lose in the end.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/","title":"Buying copper stocks now that prices are taking a dip","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-19T13:31:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-19 13:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qxeym8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"KatheKnuth","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/KatheKnuth","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"KatheKnuth","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"価格が下落している今、銅の銘柄を買う","the_new_excerpt":"銅価格が下落したのは、中国の不動産部門が低迷しているにもかかわらず、工業生産が好調なためです。\n銅価格が下落したのは、中国の工業生産が好調であるにもかかわらず、不動産部門が低迷しているためです。状況はまだ不安定ですが、私は\n私は、銅の需要は今後も増え続けると考え、銅の株を買おうと思っています。\n銅の需要は増加し続けるだろうと考え、銅の株を買おうと思っています。\n\n私はすでにいくつかの銘柄を...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在价格下跌的情况下买入铜股","the_new_excerpt":"铜价刚刚下跌，因为中国的工业产出强劲，尽管\n他们的房地产行业疲软。形势仍然动荡，但我正\n计划买入铜股，因为我知道对铜的需求会不断增加。\n铜的需求将继续增加。\n\n我已经买了一些在中国的股票。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在價格下跌的情況下買入銅股","the_new_excerpt":"銅價剛剛下跌，因爲中國的工業產出強勁，儘管\n他們的房地產行業疲軟。形勢仍然動盪，但我正\n計劃買入銅股，因爲我知道對銅的需求會不斷增加。\n銅的需求將繼續增加。\n\n我已經買了一些在中國的股票。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qx3aqt","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qx3aqt/why_is_the_new_vanguard_app_so_bad/","title":"Why is the new Vanguard app so bad?","date":"November 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"新しいVanguardのアプリはなぜそんなに悪いのか？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么新的Vanguard应用程序如此糟糕？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼新的Vanguard應用程序如此糟糕？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1461456571570040843","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1461456571570040843","title":"FUCK AUSTRALIA \nhttps://t.co/X8yNGH1Wxq","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 19, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":null}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qxeym8","previousId":"RedditPost-qx3aqt","nextId":"TweetPost-1461456571570040843","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
