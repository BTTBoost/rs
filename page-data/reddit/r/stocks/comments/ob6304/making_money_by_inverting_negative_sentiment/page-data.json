I tested it out. It actually worked out well for me several times now. But it’s a really difficult strategy to execute.</p>\n\n<p>My theory was that you can identify a good entry point in a stock based on a negative change in online sentiment which is NOT correlated to company news and updates or market performance etc.</p>\n\n<p>I believed that if the online sentiment changed to a negative one overall without there being an underlying reason, that it was a good sign that people shorting the stock were anxious to keep the price down and others were bashing it online to get a better entry point.</p>\n\n<p>My theory is that the bashing behaviour doesn’t occur at random. It occurs strategically.</p>\n\n<p>If people know the share price is going to go up in the mid term and want to keep it quiet to get a better entry point there are going to be some people who attack the stock online to try to bring the price down to give themselves more time for a lower buy in point.</p>\n\n<p>If people have been shorting a stock and need time to exit their positions as they are anticipating a rise in share price they will be inclined to do the same as well.</p>\n\n<p>So, in a way, online stock bashing could be seen as an inverse indicator of the current overall expectations of the actual future share price.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s how the strategy works. Use websites that provide indicators of stock sentiment on social media. Pick out companies which have recently had strong negative sentiment. Figure out if there is a valid reason for the change in sentiment based on publicly available information about the company.</p>\n\n<p>If nothing has changed in the companys underlying performance and they were in an uptrend before the negative sentiment began, begin to investigate the nature of the online sentiment.</p>\n\n<p>Go on Reddit, Stocktwits or Twitter and actually read through all the comments you can find. Check to see whether or not the negative comments are baseless.</p>\n\n<p>If the sentiment of the stock online is negative for a good reason, such as anticipating a logical negative outcome, then stay away.</p>\n\n<p>If the comments bashing the stock are baseless and can’t be backed up by logic, fact or reasonable predictions then you probably have a winner.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this strategy can be stressful. You have to read a lot of negativity. You have to think critically and have extensive knowledge of how the market and businesses work. You have to be able to discern bullshit and emotional statements from logic. You have to be able to tell the difference between genuine criticism of a company’s performance and false criticism which can sound logical but often skews the facts to try to generate a negative view of the company. But those types of statements won’t stand up to solid research on the company.</p>\n\n<p>If a stock is being heavily attacked online using flawed logic and emotional statements and there are no red flags about the company other than a recent change in share price caused by the above bashing and trolling behaviours then you probably have a good buy in point as the stock will now have an unfair lower price point caused exclusively by bashers.</p>\n\n<p>If you strongly believe this is the case and there is no discernible grey area after solid investigation, just buy the stock. Ignore websites that give price targets as those are always generated based on existing numbers including the dips caused by bashing.</p>\n\n<p>You have to be willing to hold until the bashing behaviour subsides or until the company’s performance proves them wrong. Once it does and investor sentiment returns to the norm you will gain by the artificial price suppression being lifted. In addition, companies being bashed like this usually have something going for them so you can capitalize on their progress at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>I guess you could say this strategy basically takes advantage of trolls and bashers and uses the price suppression resulting from their online behaviour as leverage to amplify your gains.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ob6304/making_money_by_inverting_negative_sentiment/","title":"Making money by inverting negative sentiment created by stock bashing and trolling","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-01T20:26:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-01 20:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"cbf0ac74-894e-5c72-8d9f-d0bd4a937192","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ob6304/making_money_by_inverting_negative_sentiment/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ob6304/making_money_by_inverting_negative_sentiment/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TheSqueezeHasSquozen","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheSqueezeHasSquozen","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TheSqueezeHasSquozen","score":40,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"株のバッシングや荒らしで生じた負の感情を反転させて儲ける","the_new_excerpt":"この方法は、急激な感情の変化や価格変動が起こりやすいペニーストックには特に有効です。\n感情の変化や価格の変動が激しいペニーストックには特に有効です。\n\nトレンドを見つけた。私はそれを試してみました。実際、私にとってはうまくいった。\n今では何度も成功しています。でも、実行するのは本当に難しい戦略なんだ。\n\n私の理論は、良いエントリーを見極めることができるというもので...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"通过颠倒抨击和嘲弄股票所造成的负面情绪来赚钱","the_new_excerpt":"这对细价股特别有效，因为它们更容易出现快速的\n情绪变化和价格波动。\n\n我发现了一个趋势。我测试了它。它实际上为我带来了好几\n次。但这是一个真正难以执行的策略。\n\n我的理论是，你可以确定一个好的入口...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"通過顛倒抨擊和嘲弄股票所造成的負面情緒來賺錢","the_new_excerpt":"這對細價股特別有效，因爲它們更容易出現快速的\n情緒變化和價格波動。\n\n我發現了一個趨勢。我測試了它。它實際上爲我帶來了好幾\n次。但這是一個真正難以執行的策略。\n\n我的理論是，你可以確定一個好的入口...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1410676463636996101","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1410676463636996101","title":"RT @zerohedge: Robinhood paid former SEC head  Dan Gallagher $30 million, most of it in stock https://t.co/aTxrpsuv1c","date":"July 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: ロビンフッドは元SEC長官のダン・ギャラガー氏に3,000万ドルを支払い、そのほとんどが株式で支払われた https://t.co/aTxrpsuv1c","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"ロビンフッドは元SEC長官のダン・ギャラガー氏に3,000万ドルを支払い、そのほとんどが株式であった https://t.co/aTxrpsuv1c"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: Robinhood支付给前SEC负责人Dan Gallagher 3000万美元，其中大部分是股票https://t.co/aTxrpsuv1c。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"Robinhood向前SEC负责人Dan Gallagher支付了3000万美元，其中大部分为股票https://t.co/aTxrpsuv1c"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: Robinhood支付給前SEC負責人Dan Gallagher 3000萬美元，其中大部分是股票https://t.co/aTxrpsuv1c。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"Robinhood向前SEC負責人Dan Gallagher支付了3000萬美元，其中大部分爲股票https://t.co/aTxrpsuv1c"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-32b35ccf-7ecf-5e97-ae12-875432b035c9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obd5vx/hi_am_an_genius_who_thinks_stocks_mentioned_on/","title":"Hi am An genius who thinks stocks mentioned on WSB will all explode so I go and buy the peak with all his gains now I need a sugar moma or daddy idc anymore 💔","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 01, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私は、WSBで紹介されている銘柄が全て爆発すると思っている天才で、彼が得た全ての利益でピークを買いに行きました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"嗨，我是一个天才，认为WSB上提到的股票都会爆炸，所以我去买了他所有的收益，现在我需要一个糖妈妈或糖爸爸，我不知道了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"嗨，我是一個天才，認爲WSB上提到的股票都會爆炸，所以我去買了他所有的收益，現在我需要一個糖媽媽或糖爸爸，我不知道了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-cbf0ac74-894e-5c72-8d9f-d0bd4a937192","previousId":"TweetPost-1410676463636996101","nextId":"RedditPost-32b35ccf-7ecf-5e97-ae12-875432b035c9","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ob6304/making_money_by_inverting_negative_sentiment/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
