At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO&#39;s cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we&#39;ve subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO&#39;s 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299\">link</a> to see.</p>\n\n<p>I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here&#39;s a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1\">link</a>. As you can see, NIO is doing <strong>considerably better</strong>; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--<a href=\"https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984\">link</a> to see that too.</p>\n\n<p>So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a <a href=\"https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/\">link</a>. Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany&#39;s biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what&#39;s coming for NIO.</p>\n\n<p>Where does amusement come in? That&#39;s right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.</p>\n\n<p>Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593\">link</a>. And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That&#39;s right, Citrons price target. Of course, what&#39;s interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer&#39;s post; some of my favorites are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853\">3</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226\">4</a>, it seems like the tactic used isn&#39;t working. In fact I think it&#39;s pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO&#39;s price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work. What&#39;s also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.</p>\n\n<p>Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376\">link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I think we&#39;ll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553\">buying</a> NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They&#39;ve really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I&#39;m confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!</p>\n\n<p>I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.</p>\n\n<p>NIO all the way.</p>\n\n<p>And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Edit* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here&#39;s a few links for proof <a href=\"https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721\">2</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mlvi50/interesting_and_amusing_news_about_nio/","title":"Interesting, and amusing news about NIO","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-07T18:57:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-07 18:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"76563ca6-2bfe-5122-b907-de5a053d4a95","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mlvi50/interesting_and_amusing_news_about_nio/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mlvi50/interesting_and_amusing_news_about_nio/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"the_mirror_viewer01","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_mirror_viewer01","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"the_mirror_viewer01","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"NIOに関する興味深く、面白いニュース","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。\n\nNIOを取り巻くいくつかの興味深いニュースがありました。\nNIOgangは日々の生活や仕事に追われながらも、常にNIOの動向を気にかけています。\nNIOgangは日々の生活や仕事に追われながらも、常にNIOの動向を把握しています。\n\nNIOの第1四半期の売上は非常に印象的で、20,060...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"关于NIO的有趣、好玩的新闻。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，又是大家。\n\n所以，围绕着NIO又出现了一些有趣的消息；而NIOgang，虽然。\n我们每天都忙于生活和工作，我们总是在忙于指\nNIO的脉搏；或者说至少在努力，哈哈。\n\n所以我们知道NIO在第一季度的销量非常惊人--达到了20,060-...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於NIO的有趣、好玩的新聞。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，又是大家。\n\n所以，圍繞着NIO又出現了一些有趣的消息；而NIOgang，雖然。\n我們每天都忙於生活和工作，我們總是在忙於指\nNIO的脈搏；或者說至少在努力，哈哈。\n\n所以我們知道NIO在第一季度的銷量非常驚人--達到了20,060-...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-33470023-fe79-54c4-a0e8-46224e525a39","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mm43ro/calling_your_bluff_hf_im_all_in/","title":"Calling your bluff HF!
