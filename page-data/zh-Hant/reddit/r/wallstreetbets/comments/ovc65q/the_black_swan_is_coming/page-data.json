Out of five hospitalizations, four were fully vaccinated, but there were no deaths, the federal agency said.\nThe CDC calls the vaccination the most important strategy to prevent the severe form of COVID-19 and death.\nHowever, citing the findings of the analysis, the agency says that tougher public health measures such as indoor masking are likely irrespective of vaccination status even in areas “without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission.”\nEarly this week, CDC updated guidance recommending indoor masks for those in areas with substantial and high levels of COVID-19 transmission”</p>\n\n<p>Short summary, resurgence of Covid has not been priced in stock market today.
