The S&amp;P 500 index SPX, -0.26% has rallied 30.0% over a 12-month span and gained 5.5% over a three-month span.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roku-stock-plunges-after-downgrade-estimates-are-just-too-damn-high-says-analyst-11637166554\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roku-stock-plunges-after-downgrade-estimates-are-just-too-damn-high-says-analyst-11637166554</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qwdhgz/roku_stock_plunges_after_downgrade_estimates_are/","title":"Roku stock plunges after downgrade; estimates ‘are just too damn high,’ says analyst","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-18T13:31:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-18 13:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qwdhgz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qwdhgz/roku_stock_plunges_after_downgrade_estimates_are/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qwdhgz/roku_stock_plunges_after_downgrade_estimates_are/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rockinoutwith2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rockinoutwith2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rockinoutwith2","score":47,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Rokuの株価が格下げされて急落、アナリストは「予想があまりにも高すぎる」と指摘","the_new_excerpt":"Roku Inc.の株価は、あるアナリストがRoku Inc.の株式を格下げし、投資家がRoku Inc.\nアナリストがRoku Inc.の株価を下げ、投資家が最近の同社のストーリーを誤解していると指摘したため、同社の株価は水曜日に急落しました。\n水曜日、Roku Inc.\n\n「株価が予想以上に好調で上昇しているときは\n株価が予想以上に好調で上昇しているときには、投資家が会社のストーリーを間違って解釈しているのではないかと疑うような質問はほとんどされません。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"下调评级后Roku股价暴跌；分析师称估计 \"太他妈高了","the_new_excerpt":"在一位分析师下调了Roku公司的评级后，该公司的股价周三受到了打击。\n并表示投资者误解了该公司近期的情况。\n最近的情况。\n\n\"当一只股票因一系列强劲和好于预期的业绩而上涨时。\n当一只股票因一系列强劲且好于预期的业绩而上涨时，很少有人会提出探究性问题，因为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"下調評級後Roku股價暴跌；分析師稱估計 \"太他媽高了","the_new_excerpt":"在一位分析師下調了Roku公司的評級後，該公司的股價週三受到了打擊。\n並表示投資者誤解了該公司近期的情況。\n最近的情況。\n\n\"當一隻股票因一系列強勁和好於預期的業績而上漲時。\n當一隻股票因一系列強勁且好於預期的業績而上漲時，很少有人會提出探究性問題，因爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qwo0q3","excerpt":"Alibaba missed revenue and earnings expectations for the September quarter, as\nslowing economic growth in China and the country’s crackdown on its technology\ncompanies weighed on results.\n\nHere’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal second-quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus\nestimates:\n\nRevenue: 200.69…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qwo0q3/alibaba_misses_expectations_as_earnings_plunge_38/","title":"Alibaba misses expectations as earnings plunge 38% in the September quarter","date":"November 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アリババ、9月期の収益が38%急落し、予想を下回る","the_new_excerpt":"アリババ社の9月の四半期決算は、売上高、利益ともに予想を下回りました。\nこれは、中国の経済成長の鈍化および中国におけるテクノロジー企業の取り締まりが業績に影響を与えたためです。\nこれは、中国の経済成長の鈍化とテクノロジー企業に対する取り締まりが業績を圧迫したためです。\n\nアリババの第2四半期の業績は、Refinitivのコンセンサスに対して以下の通りです。\n予想との比較です。\n\n売上高: 200.69...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"阿里巴巴9月季度盈利暴跌38%，不及预期","the_new_excerpt":"阿里巴巴9月份的收入和盈利未达预期，因为\n因为中国经济增长放缓和中国对其技术公司的打击\n公司的打击，影响了业绩。\n\n以下是阿里巴巴第二财季的表现，与Refinitiv共识相比\n估计。\n\n收入：200.69亿美元","locale":"zh"},{"title":"阿里巴巴9月季度盈利暴跌38%，不及預期","the_new_excerpt":"阿里巴巴9月份的收入和盈利未達預期，因爲\n因爲中國經濟增長放緩和中國對其技術公司的打擊\n公司的打擊，影響了業績。\n\n以下是阿里巴巴第二財季的表現，與Refinitiv共識相比\n估計。\n\n收入：200.69億美元","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1461230505697984516","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1461230505697984516","title":"Former New York Jets running back Zac Stacy \nhttps://t.co/2yo0KnFV2K","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 18, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"元ニューヨーク・ジェッツのランニングバック、ザック・ステイシー氏 \nhttps://t.co/2yo0KnFV2K","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"前纽约喷气机队跑卫扎克-斯泰西 \nhttps://t.co/2yo0KnFV2K","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"前紐約噴氣機隊跑衛扎克-斯泰西 \nhttps://t.co/2yo0KnFV2K","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qwdhgz","previousId":"RedditPost-qwo0q3","nextId":"TweetPost-1461230505697984516","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qwdhgz/roku_stock_plunges_after_downgrade_estimates_are/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
