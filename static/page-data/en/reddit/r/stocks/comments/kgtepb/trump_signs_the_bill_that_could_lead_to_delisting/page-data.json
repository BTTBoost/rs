Last year, the government supported Nio by offering it a RMB7 billion (US$1b) bailout last year, providing the company some much needed financial support (the company&#39;s cash was down to RMB863m at the end of 2019 from RMB3.1b in the preceding year).  </p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-motors-nyse-nio-chinese-164539129.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-motors-nyse-nio-chinese-164539129.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, this seems to be a very risky stock. However, an opportunity for us. How? Because:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>NIO and other Chinese stocks have 3 years to comply with the legislation.</li>\n<li>If they fail to do so, they might be delisted from NYSE but <strong>NOT</strong> from the other stock exchanges. However, there might be some stock transfer charges which NIO shareholders have to undergo which no one is clear about.</li>\n<li>EV market cap</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>..and we all know the &quot;fear&quot; - &quot;greedy&quot; saying from our godfather. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: Only my opinion, I am a newbie as the name suggests.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kgtepb/trump_signs_the_bill_that_could_lead_to_delisting/","title":"Trump Signs the Bill, That Could Lead To Delisting Of Chinese Stocks - Opportunity in NIO, BABA, XPeng, etc?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 20, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-20T21:37:29.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-20 21:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"708cb918-05c8-5e86-a145-7e4bb1bf1de1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kgtepb/trump_signs_the_bill_that_could_lead_to_delisting/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kgtepb/trump_signs_the_bill_that_could_lead_to_delisting/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"newbie_3297","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/newbie_3297","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"newbie_3297","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"特朗普签署法案，可能导致中国股票退市-NIO，巴巴，XPeng等机会？","the_new_excerpt":"所以这一天终于到了，特朗普签署了一项立法，可以\n中国股票退市：\n\n重要的是要知道：\n\n>该法案还将要求上市公司披露它们是否拥有\n>或由外国政府控制。\n>\n>来源：\n>…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特朗普簽署法案，可能導致中國股票退市-NIO，巴巴，XPeng等機會？","the_new_excerpt":"所以這一天終於到了，特朗普簽署了一項立法，可以\n中國股票退市：\n\n重要的是要知道：\n\n>該法案還將要求上市公司披露它們是否擁有\n>或由外國政府控制。\n>\n>來源：\n>…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-db262e1b-500e-50a8-800f-164c5de3d182","excerpt":"Even more bad news came in for SolarWinds over the weekend, and SolarWinds is\ngoing to crash again on Monday.
