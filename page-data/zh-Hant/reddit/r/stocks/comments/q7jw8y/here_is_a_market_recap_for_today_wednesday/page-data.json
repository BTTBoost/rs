Today&#39;s recap is a bit longer than usual because there was a lot of really important information released. I urge you to read until the end, especially the part regarding the CPI.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Stocks finished mostly even, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the day as market participants digested the start of earnings season, the consumer and producer price indexes, which showed an acceleration in inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s September meeting minutes, which are basically notes of what was discussed in the meeting. </p>\n\n<p>While supply-side disruptions have been going on since the beginning of the pandemic (when the world was essentially forced to shut down overnight), recent developments reflect the extent of these disruptions heading into the holidays, by far the busiest season for retailers. Due to congestions in the ports and sky-high shipping rates, companies like Target (TGT), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT) have resorted to chartering their own ships and diverting the usual routes to less congested ports. In a statement, Target recently said “As co-managers of the ship, we can avoid delays from additional stops and steer clear of particularly backed-up ports.”</p>\n\n<p>In addition, President Biden met with leaders from the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to discuss supply chain issues at the ports. In the end, the parties agreed to expand port operations activities to be 24/7 nationwide. </p>\n\n<p>The latest batch of economic data due Wednesday confirmed that these supply and demand mismatches translated to ongoing inflationary pressures.  Labor Department&#39;s Consumer Price Index, core prices, excluding food and energy, rose by 4.0% in September over last year, coming down only slightly from June&#39;s 30-year high of 4.5%. And a broader measure of consumer prices including all categories rose 5.4% in September compared to last year, coming in at the fastest pace since 2008. Please, before you ask why food and energy are excluded from core CPI, read the exact reason by the Federal Reserve below. </p>\n\n<p>To understand why the categories of food and energy are more sensitive to price changes and thus not useful measures when considering broad inflationary measures, consider environmental factors that can ravage a year’s crops or fluctuations in the oil supply resulting from the OPEC cartel. Each is an example of a supply shock that may affect the prices for that product. However, although the prices of those goods may frequently increase or decrease at rapid rates, the price disturbances may not be related to a trend change in the economy’s overall price level. Instead, changes in food and energy prices often are more likely related to temporary factors that may reverse themselves later. Basically, including food and energy prices economists may be fooled into believing that general prices are rising or falling more rapidly than they really are</p>\n\n<p>Please, I urge you to read the Fed’s exact reasoning as to why Core CPI is taken as the real measure of inflation, I’ve seen a TON of misinformation spreading about this across social media. Core CPI has been calculated the exact same way for decades, I don’t understand why it became so controversial this year. Please read to link below, it is fundamentally necessary for us market participants to understand how this works. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/october/core-inflation-headline/\">https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/october/core-inflation-headline/</a></p>\n\n<p>In the latest monthly monetary policy meeting, the Fed signaled it would likely begin reducing the pace of asset-purchasing by $15 billion per month starting in November or December. As a reminder, since early on in the pandemic, the Fed implemented a program of quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion per month. This is exactly what I said would happen last month, and it seems the market already priced this in. Like I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing raising the interest rate. </p>\n\n<p>Q3 earnings season kicked off with JP Morgan (JPM), the largest bank in the US, and BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset management company in the world, reporting earnings. Both smashed earnings estimates. Here are the numbers</p>\n\n<p><strong>JP Morgan - JPM</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue of $30.44 billion v $29.8 billion expected</li>\n<li>Earnings per share of $3.74 v $3 expected</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>BlackRock - BLK</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Asset Under Management (AUM): $9.46 trillion v $7.81 trillion last year</li>\n<li>Revenue of $5.1 billion v $4.9 billion expected</li>\n<li>Earnings per share of $10.95 v $9.54</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, <a href=\"https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf\">according to FactSet data. </a>Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter&#39;s nearly 90% pace. </p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.&quot; -Eleanor Roosevelt</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q7jw8y/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, October 13, 2021.
