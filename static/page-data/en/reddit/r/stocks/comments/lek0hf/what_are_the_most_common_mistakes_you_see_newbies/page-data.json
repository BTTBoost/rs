I&#39;ve spent most of the past two weeks reading about topics such as DD, some of the stocks that are popular here and on other investing-related subreddits, and the basics of options (CC, CSP, long calls/puts, wheel). At the same time, looking through a variety of stocks makes me feel like a lot of potential for putting some money into the market now and it feels like the majority of moves would be profitable. I recognize part of that is likely because of the current bull market. However, if you were to just stick with buying stable stocks (e.g. GOOG, AAPL) or even buying/selling options barely OTM with a decent expiration date, seems like you could make pretty easy money.</p>\n\n<p>I can foresee a couple of scenarios where there is potential for big losses:</p>\n\n<p>1) Market crashes.
