INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.\nYes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.</p>\n\n<p>/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it&#39;s also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.</p>\n\n<p>/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel&#39;s 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.</p>\n\n<p>For reference, TSMC&#39;s market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that&#39;s a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).</p>\n\n<p>/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.\nWhich would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.</p>\n\n<p>/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.</p>\n\n<p>/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don&#39;t know how big this will be in 10 years, but it&#39;s likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.</p>\n\n<p>/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that&#39;s also something that&#39;s worth noting at least. </p>\n\n<p>However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.</p>\n\n<p><em>Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel&#39;s lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.</em></p>\n\n<p>/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel&#39;s management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.</p>\n\n<p>/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that&#39;s good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.</p>\n\n<p>/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.</p>\n\n<p>/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it&#39;s near that range right now.</p>\n\n<p>/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?</p>\n\n<p>/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bear Cases</strong></p>\n\n<p>/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit&#39;s circejerk. So, it&#39;s difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management&#39;s conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn&#39;t care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.</p>\n\n<p>/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division&#39;s predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.</p>\n\n<p>/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.</p>\n\n<p>/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.</p>\n\n<p>/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/xxYyDIE\">positions or ban. bought 100 shares for now. will be selling some puts to enter into more. And then around the next earnings, will buy some calls</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qpxq94/intel_the_second_coming_of_christ/","title":"Intel: The second coming of christ","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-09T15:01:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-09 15:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qpxq94","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qpxq94/intel_the_second_coming_of_christ/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qpxq94/intel_the_second_coming_of_christ/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Last_Interview_4332","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Last_Interview_4332","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Last_Interview_4332","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"インテル キリストの再臨","the_new_excerpt":"BULL CASES\n\n/INTCは、韓国のSamsunに対抗できる唯一の米国チップメーカーである。\n韓国のSamsungや台湾のTSMCに合理的に対抗できる唯一の米国チップメーカーである。\nまた、政府から文字通り多額の資金（約500億ドル相当）を得ている。\n政府から文字通り巨額の現金(約5,000億ドル相当)を得ており、これは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"英特尔。基督的第二次降临","the_new_excerpt":"牛市案例\n\n/1.INTC是唯一真正的美国芯片制造商，可以合理地与韩国三星竞争。\n韩国的三星和台湾的台积电（承认台湾而获得-100分）。\n它正在获得大量的现金（大概是500亿美元）。\n等值），这对它来说是积极的。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"英特爾。基督的第二次降臨","the_new_excerpt":"牛市案例\n\n/1.INTC是唯一真正的美國芯片製造商，可以合理地與韓國三星競爭。\n韓國的三星和臺灣的臺積電（承認臺灣而獲得-100分）。\n它正在獲得大量的現金（大概是500億美元）。\n等值），這對它來說是積極的。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qpxxmh","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpxxmh/50k_to_700k_in_a_year/","title":"$50k to $700k in a year 🚀","date":"November 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"1年で5万ドルから7万ドル🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"一年内5万到70万 🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"一年內5萬到70萬 🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qpz1g4","excerpt":"hi,\n\nwhat's the biggest mistakes or events that can destroy your wealth once you've\nreached your number?\nIn other words the best and intelligent way to preserve your wealth.\n\nThanks guys","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qpz1g4/how_to_not_get_rich_twice/","title":"how to not get rich twice ?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 09, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"二度金持ちにならないためには？","the_new_excerpt":"をご覧ください。\n\nあなたが自分の番号に到達した後に、あなたの富を破壊する最大の間違いや出来事は何ですか？\n到達した後に富を失う最大の失敗や出来事は何ですか？\n言い換えれば、あなたの富を維持するための最良で知的な方法です。\n\nありがとうございます。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如何不致于两次致富？","the_new_excerpt":"嗨。\n\n一旦你达到了你的数字，什么是最大的错误或事件可以摧毁你的财富？\n达到你的数字？\n换句话说，就是保存你的财富的最佳和明智的方法。\n\n谢谢大家","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何不致於兩次致富？","the_new_excerpt":"嗨。\n\n一旦你達到了你的數字，什麼是最大的錯誤或事件可以摧毀你的財富？\n達到你的數字？\n換句話說，就是保存你的財富的最佳和明智的方法。\n\n謝謝大家","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qpxq94","previousId":"RedditPost-qpxxmh","nextId":"RedditPost-qpz1g4","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qpxq94/intel_the_second_coming_of_christ/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
