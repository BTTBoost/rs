In a post on the company’s blog, Robinhood HOOD, +2.62% disclosed that a customer-support employee was tricked into giving access to systems late on Nov. 3. The hacker was then able to access a list of about 5 million email addresses as well as full names for about 2 million customers, with a smaller subset of customers — 310, according to Robinhood — potentially having more data at risk.</p>\n\n<p>The company said that no social security numbers nor payment information was accessed, and no customers had suffered financial losses as a result. Robinhood’s blog stated that the hackers sought an extortion payment after the intrusion, but did not say if a ransom was paid. The company said it had informed law enforcement and called in cybersecurity company Mandiant Inc. MNDT, +3.00% to help investigate.</p>\n\n<p>“Following a diligent review, putting the entire Robinhood community on notice of this incident now is the right thing to do,” Robinhood Chief Security Officer Caleb Sima said in the post. Robinhood is in the process of informing affected customers directly, the company disclosed. The company directed customers to the “Account Security” portion of its “Help Center” for more information on keeping personal data secure. Robinhood shares declined about 3% in after-hours trading, after closing with a 2.6% gain at $37.98.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/robinhood-says-customer-data-was-accessed-in-breach-stock-falls-in-after-hours-11636407045?siteid=bnbh\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/robinhood-says-customer-data-was-accessed-in-breach-stock-falls-in-after-hours-11636407045?siteid=bnbh</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qpyitj/robinhood_says_customer_data_was_accessed_in/","title":"Robinhood says customer data was accessed in breach, stock falls in after-hours","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-09T13:05:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-09 13:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qpyitj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qpyitj/robinhood_says_customer_data_was_accessed_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qpyitj/robinhood_says_customer_data_was_accessed_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rodriq04","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rodriq04","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rodriq04","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロビンフッド社、顧客データへのアクセスがあったと発表、時間外で株価下落","the_new_excerpt":"ロビンフッド・マーケッツ社は月曜日の午後、同社のモバイル・トレーディング・アプリの顧客のデータが先週、侵害されたと発表しました。\n同社のモバイル・トレーディング・アプリの顧客データが、先週の情報漏えい事件でアクセスされたと発表し、株価は取引終了後に下落しました。\n株式は取引終了後に下落しました。同社のブログでは、Robinhood HOOD, +2.62% が次のように述べている。\nカスタマーサポートの従業員が、騙されてアクセス権を与えられたことを明らかにしました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Robinhood称客户数据被入侵，盘后股价下跌","the_new_excerpt":"Robinhood Markets Inc.周一下午表示，其移动交易应用程序的客户数据在上周被入侵。\n的移动交易应用程序的客户数据在上周的一次漏洞中被访问，股价在晚间交易中下跌。\n股价在晚间交易中下跌。Robinhood HOOD, +2.62%在该公司博客上发表文章披露\n一名客户支持员工被骗，让他访问了该网站。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood稱客戶數據被入侵，盤後股價下跌","the_new_excerpt":"Robinhood Markets Inc.週一下午表示，其移動交易應用程序的客戶數據在上週被入侵。\n的移動交易應用程序的客戶數據在上週的一次漏洞中被訪問，股價在晚間交易中下跌。\n股價在晚間交易中下跌。Robinhood HOOD, +2.62%在該公司博客上發表文章披露\n一名客戶支持員工被騙，讓他訪問了該網站。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qq1153","excerpt":"Ever since last year I have been investing mostly in gold and silver.
