The country’s Supreme Court upheld a ruling that a group of drivers were workers, not independent contractors. While the decision applied to a small group of drivers, thousands more have taken action against the company.</p>\n\n<p>In an op-ed in The Evening Standard, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote that following the Supreme Court ruling, “we could have continued to dispute drivers’ rights to any of these protections in court. Instead, we have decided to turn the page.”</p>\n\n<p>“I know many observers won’t pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle,” Khosrowshahi said. “They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change.”</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Uber and the gig economy as a whole is facing regulatory challenges around the globe. Uber has spent millions battling those challenges in other regions. </p>\n\n<p>In California, Uber pushed back against Assembly Bill 5, a gig-economy law passed by the state legislature in 2019 that tightened the rules for classifying workers as independent contractors. </p>\n\n<p>After a widespread campaign, costing over $200 million — the most expensive ballot measure in the state’s history — Uber and a handful of other gig-economy companies persuaded voters to support a ballot measure called Proposition 22, which exempted Uber and other gig-economy platforms from state employment law.</p>\n\n<p>In turn, gig workers received some benefits without full employment status. Some of the additional costs of providing benefits were passed on to ride-hailing customers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6o8ek/cnbc_uber_grants_more_than_70000_uk_drivers/","title":"[CNBC] Uber grants more than 70,000 UK drivers worker status after losing major labor battle.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T02:44:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 02:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b4982a1a-557e-5f6f-a331-206dc59a5e00","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6o8ek/cnbc_uber_grants_more_than_70000_uk_drivers/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6o8ek/cnbc_uber_grants_more_than_70000_uk_drivers/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"rrdonoo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rrdonoo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rrdonoo","score":1148,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"中新网】Uber在劳资大战中大败后，授予7万多名英国司机工人身份。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/uber-grants-uk-drivers-worker-status-after-losing-major-labor-battle.html\n\n在英国的一场重大劳资争夺战中失利后，Uber将\n将所有在英国的司机重新归类为工人。\n\n根据新的规定，超过7万名司机将获得一些... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中新網】Uber在勞資大戰中大敗後，授予7萬多名英國司機工人身份。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/uber-grants-uk-drivers-worker-status-after-losing-major-labor-battle.html\n\n在英國的一場重大勞資爭奪戰中失利後，Uber將\n將所有在英國的司機重新歸類爲工人。\n\n根據新的規定，超過7萬名司機將獲得一些... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1371838404233674756","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1371838404233674756","title":"The Twenty Craziest Investing Facts Ever\n\nhttps://t.co/kl9T35aMRw","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"史上最疯狂的20个投资事实\n\nhttps://t.co/kl9T35aMRw","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"史上最瘋狂的20個投資事實\n\nhttps://t.co/kl9T35aMRw","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-adcb07d4-b1cd-5e39-8db1-e327d5fcc2aa","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m69fhh/nobody_tell_him/","title":"Nobody tell him 💎🤌🏻","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"没有人告诉他💎🤌🏻。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"沒有人告訴他💎🤌🏻。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-b4982a1a-557e-5f6f-a331-206dc59a5e00","previousId":"TweetPost-1371838404233674756","nextId":"RedditPost-adcb07d4-b1cd-5e39-8db1-e327d5fcc2aa","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m6o8ek/cnbc_uber_grants_more_than_70000_uk_drivers/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
