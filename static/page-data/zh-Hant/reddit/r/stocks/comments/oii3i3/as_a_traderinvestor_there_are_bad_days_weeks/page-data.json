I thought it was important to go over this very important topic because I have read a lot about this all over Reddit. Some of the Elite Traders are going thru this. I am front lines with them on a daily basis. I wanted to tell everyone and anyone that it is ok, even the best of us have bad days, weeks, months, quarters....but rarely a year/years. I have been trading since very late 1994 and there is no way I can tell you everything was fine and dandy. The dot com crash of 2000 where I lost 75% off my peak was a true learning experience, and that has never happened again. But yes, I too have bad days, weeks or months. Last year with covid hit I was down about 25%, and that is because I was about 50% cash, had I been all in stocks I would have been down 40-50%...There are alot of lessons learned each time we are down.</p>\n\n<p>It is fair to measure yourself against an index like the SP500 because since its creation it has been up 8% year over year.. However, if last month you were down, and the SP was up 3% it isnt fair to be down on yourself over this! It is cap weighted index where APPL accounts for nearly 25-30% alone! AAPL accounts for 20 of the Nasdaq 100! I too, was down the last few weeks when the market turned upside down. Give yourself some time before you measure yourself against an index or another trader. Do not be so down on yourself and follow the course.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to measure yourself and get angry just look at 50% of the Nasdaq 100 that is off 33-50% off their highs.. Most of us trade tech and growth. Great company&#39;s always come back to make newer highs especially if they make cash and have earnings. So if your account is down even 50% but you are down on something solid rest assured it will come back 33-50%, Earnings season kicks off this week. And as long as you have something with earnings if the stock has been beaten down, dont fret this is the perfect time for your company to fight for proper valuation. (TCOM, SGEN, WBA, PTON, ZM, PDD) there are many more that are slammed off their highs, PDD is off 55%! If the company is solid think of this as a blip on the map....</p>\n\n<p>If you are using the market to give you steady income daily, weekly it will be a roller coaster ride. Remember, a stock is a live auction, it rarely tracks the company performance in real time, and momentum/speculation moves stocks faster. That means it is very hard to always be right every single trading day my friends. Do not be so hard on yourself and it is very hard to have a steady flow of income unless you are working with sizeable capital. Dont fret my friends, earnings season is here and most of the stocks I trade have a low PE 20 or so, and they have consistently beat top and bottom line the last few quarters so I await the earnings reports! Please do not be down on yourself just yet.... the earnings reports will give solace! If you have a speculative stock with no earnings, and they lose money and burn cash good luck!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oii3i3/as_a_traderinvestor_there_are_bad_days_weeks/","title":"As a trader/investor there are bad days, weeks, months, even quarters..
