Banks use the borrowed T-Notes to keep bond interest down so no one wants to buy government bonds. Not sure if this summation is correct, but it would be similar to Banks shorting the bond market.</p>\n\n<p>-- Yep, this is looking more and more like the case, but even weirder with Banks loaning HF&#39;s money and negative interest rates to get more treasurey notes, still reading more on this one....</p>\n\n<p>--&gt; If Bond interest rates keep going up, then prices for them will go down. If Banks buy up treasuries and then sell them on the treasury market, they can buy them back at a later date after interest rates have risen, AT A LOWER PRICE, banks keep the difference, BUT if there&#39;s a shortage of TNotes, OR if interest rates start falling again, Banks have to buy them back at higher prices, which....  ------&gt; This is gonna need a whole new post, this is getting DEEP.</p>\n\n<p>---&gt; Yea, this is atobitt&#39;s stuff definitely, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/\">READ THEIR POST about the shorting of the bond market and the short squeeze for TNotes</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhl9mg/why_has_there_been_two_days_of_100_billion_in/","title":"Why Has There Been Two Days Of $100+ Billion In Reverse Repo Operations?","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"April 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-01T23:18:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-01 23:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1bf21c43-6cfc-5df1-b0b9-0c4e2e1ad9b0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhl9mg/why_has_there_been_two_days_of_100_billion_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhl9mg/why_has_there_been_two_days_of_100_billion_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"President_Wolfe","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/President_Wolfe","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"President_Wolfe","score":1033,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么这两天出现了千亿以上的逆回购操作？","the_new_excerpt":"这几天，当日逆回购疯狂涌动\n纽约联储的业务。\n\n你问的这些逆向回购是什么，我也问了BTW，但根据纽约\n美联储。\n\n\" 纽约联储每天都会进行回购和逆回购操作，以此作为\n以帮助保持联邦...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼這兩天出現了千億以上的逆回購操作？","the_new_excerpt":"這幾天，當日逆回購瘋狂湧動\n紐約聯儲的業務。\n\n你問的這些逆向回購是什麼，我也問了BTW，但根據紐約\n美聯儲。\n\n\" 紐約聯儲每天都會進行回購和逆回購操作，以此作爲\n以幫助保持聯邦...","locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"なぜ、2日間で1000億ドル以上のリバースレポオペレーションが行われたのか？","the_new_excerpt":"ここ数日、即日リバースレポが異常に急増しています。\n操作が急増しています。\n\nこのリバース・レポとは何なのか、と皆さんは尋ねるでしょうし、私も同様に尋ねますが、ニューヨーク連銀によると、次のようになっています。\nFRBによると\n\n\" ニューヨーク連銀は、連邦政府の国債を維持するための手段として、毎日レポとリバースレポのオペレーションを行っています。\nレポとリバース・レポ・オペレーションを行っている。","locale":"ja-JA"},{"title":"なぜ、2日間で1000億ドル以上のリバースレポオペレーションが行われたのか？","the_new_excerpt":"ここ数日、即日リバースレポが異常に急増しています。\n操作が急増しています。\n\nこのリバース・レポとは何なのか、と皆さんは尋ねるでしょうし、私も同様に尋ねますが、ニューヨーク連銀によると、次のようになっています。\nFRBによると\n\n\" ニューヨーク連銀は、連邦政府の国債を維持するための手段として、毎日レポとリバースレポのオペレーションを行っています。\nレポとリバース・レポ・オペレーションを行っている。","locale":"ja"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e25052f6-33e4-511a-8b2e-cc1e26c14725","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi5at0/diamond_hands_cocktail/","title":"💎🙌 Diamond Hands Cocktail 💎🙌","date":"April 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"💎🙌钻石手鸡尾酒💎🙌。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"💎🙌鑽石手雞尾酒💎🙌。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"💎🙌ダイヤモンドハンズのカクテル","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja-JA"},{"title":"💎🙌ダイヤモンドハンズのカクテル","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-9dd7d1da-fa8b-54e5-9c48-a7ecc00741b4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi5og1/april_fools_day_came_a_day_early_for_me_fidelity/","title":"April Fools Day came a day early for me.
