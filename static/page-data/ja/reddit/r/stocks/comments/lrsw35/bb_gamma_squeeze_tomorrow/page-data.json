T<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrsn56/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/\">ake a look at the open interest for calls expiring this Friday</a> (i.e., Feb. 26) at strike prices of $11.00, $11.50, and $12.00. You are looking at 18,722 contracts open as of the close of trading today (i.e., Feb. 24).</p>\n\n<p>Given the sell-off in the NASDAQ this week, many hedge funds / others thought BB was going to stay under $11. (Look at the spike in open interest at $11). I bet a bunch of the options at $11 and above were written naked. If BB can close above $13 tomorrow, a boat load of call options will be in the money. Friday could bring a gamma squeeze where BB really takes off.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrsw35/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/","title":"$BB Gamma squeeze tomorrow??","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T02:32:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 02:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"679fa1e9-f917-5328-b256-f29699f92fb9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrsw35/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrsw35/bb_gamma_squeeze_tomorrow/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"growthinvestor123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/growthinvestor123","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"growthinvestor123","score":594,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$BB伽马明天挤吗？","the_new_excerpt":"从图表上看，认为明天可能会看到BB的伽马压制。\n\n现在我打这个字的时候，BB的盘后价格是12.40元/股。这\n价格放置不少看涨期权的钱。看一看公开的\n兴趣的电话到期，这...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BB伽馬明天擠嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"從圖表上看，認爲明天可能會看到BB的伽馬壓制。\n\n現在我打這個字的時候，BB的盤後價格是12.40元/股。這\n價格放置不少看漲期權的錢。看一看公開的\n興趣的電話到期，這...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-606147a6-ff85-53e4-90a6-20f8f78e74db","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrpl25/power_to_the_players/","title":"Power to the players","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"权力给球员","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"權力給球員","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-3dd648e6-d698-5247-8d59-befbbacc432c","excerpt":"Sometimes funds go down.
