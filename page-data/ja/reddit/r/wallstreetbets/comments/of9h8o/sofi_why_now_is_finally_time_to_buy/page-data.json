(and what little selling may occur from employees- is a drop in the ocean compared to retail buyers... considering SOFI has less than 1000 employees). </p>\n\n<p>Cramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). </p>\n\n<p>And with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to spin off in the Future (similar to EBay &amp; Paypal)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...\nthey also have Galileo for the platform/\nSoftware fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting... Anthony Noto as CEO.. CFO came from Uber... person in charge of Galileo from Google,etc.</p>\n\n<p>*<em>Overview of Business *</em></p>\n\n<p>SoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a\nnational bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will\nallow SOFI to take direct deposits &amp; make\nloans based on those deposits, rather than\nacting as a re-seller.</p>\n\n<p>Sofi also offers Credit Cards &amp; recently\nannounced it deal to offer auto loans. Also,\ntheres SoFi brokerage, which competes with\nRobinhood.</p>\n\n<p>Then add to the mix, Galileo, a payments\nprocessor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for\n$1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-\nService (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers\nbanking platform for over 90% of all digital\nbanks in North America. Over 70% of Top100\nFintechs globally are clients- including Chime\nand Robinhood.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of9h8o/sofi_why_now_is_finally_time_to_buy/","title":"SOFI- Why now is Finally time to buy...","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-07T17:54:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-07 17:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"07d61137-869a-5db1-9e5a-192ab5fbceaa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of9h8o/sofi_why_now_is_finally_time_to_buy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of9h8o/sofi_why_now_is_finally_time_to_buy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"SCModerate","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SCModerate","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SCModerate","score":1152,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SOFI-なぜ今が最後の買い時なのか...","the_new_excerpt":"SOFIは今日、17.25ドルあたりで底を打ったようです...PIPEの売りがなくなったことで\nはもっと上に行く準備ができています。(そして、従業員からのわずかな売りは\n従業員からのわずかな売りは、小売店のバイヤーに比べれば大海の一滴に過ぎません...SOFIの従業員は1000人にも満たないのですから)\nの従業員は1000人にも満たないのですから）。)\n\nクレーマーはSoFIを1...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"SOFI-为什么现在是购买的最后时机...","the_new_excerpt":"今天SOFI似乎已经在17.25美元左右触底......并且随着PIPE卖盘的耗尽\n已用尽--已准备好大幅上涨。雇员可能出现的少量卖盘\n与零售买家相比，这只是沧海一粟...考虑到SOFI\n有不到1000名员工）。)\n\nCramer刚刚将SoFI列为1...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"SOFI-爲什麼現在是購買的最後時機...","the_new_excerpt":"今天SOFI似乎已經在17.25美元左右觸底......並且隨着PIPE賣盤的耗盡\n已用盡--已準備好大幅上漲。僱員可能出現的少量賣盤\n與零售買家相比，這只是滄海一粟...考慮到SOFI\n有不到1000名員工）。)\n\nCramer剛剛將SoFI列爲1...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1412803496752123914","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1412803496752123914","title":"Covid-19 deaths in the US hit another pandemic low, now down 94% from their peak in January. https://t.co/kayc9knbiu","date":"July 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国におけるコヴィド-19の死亡者数は、1月のピーク時に比べて94％減少し、パンデミックの最低水準を記録。https://t.co/kayc9knbiu","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国的Covid-19死亡人数再次创下大流行的新低，现在比1月份的峰值下降了94%。https://t.co/kayc9knbiu","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國的Covid-19死亡人數再次創下大流行的新低，現在比1月份的峯值下降了94%。https://t.co/kayc9knbiu","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-87494170-3496-512d-8fbb-81c760577a6d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2swv/bought_at_the_beginning_of_the_day_sold_at_the_end/","title":"Bought at the beginning of the day, sold at the end.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 07, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"一日の始まりに買って、終わりに売る。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"在一天的开始时买入，在结束时卖出。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在一天的開始時買入，在結束時賣出。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-07d61137-869a-5db1-9e5a-192ab5fbceaa","previousId":"TweetPost-1412803496752123914","nextId":"RedditPost-87494170-3496-512d-8fbb-81c760577a6d","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of9h8o/sofi_why_now_is_finally_time_to_buy/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
