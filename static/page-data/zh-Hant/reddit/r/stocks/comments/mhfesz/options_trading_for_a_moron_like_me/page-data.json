About a week later they sent me an email asking me to call them. I assume to laugh at me and call me an idiot because on the application I had to put that I have never traded options and am a moron. So I called them today. The guys asked what my strategy was and my knowledge base. He asked me if I knew what a &quot;call&quot; and &quot;put&quot; were. Honestly I gotta say he was more polite and understanding than I would have been with someone as stupid as I am. I said I read books and watched videos. Actually other people read books and told me about it and I watched YouTube videos. I asked him what level access do I need to short stocks and I said it with a straight face. He said I&#39;d need a margin account, so I asked what level could I trade options without margin and he gave me level 1 access. Tbh, I&#39;m surprised he let me have that. He said for the higher level 3 access I originally asked for I would need margin and a minimum of 100k in my account.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mhfesz/options_trading_for_a_moron_like_me/","title":"Options trading for a moron like me","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-01T03:04:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-01 03:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5f31c79b-8c0f-53f8-8895-b9ac68c7b563","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mhfesz/options_trading_for_a_moron_like_me/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mhfesz/options_trading_for_a_moron_like_me/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TrueNeutrino","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrueNeutrino","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TrueNeutrino","score":79,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"像我这样的白痴的期权交易","the_new_excerpt":"我申请了期权交易和保证金。我要求完全的3级权限，像\n大狗。大约一周后，他们给我发了一封邮件，让我给他们打电话。I\n假设嘲笑我，说我是白痴，因为在申请书上我必须...\n把我从来没有交易的选项，是一个白痴。所以我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"像我這樣的白癡的期權交易","the_new_excerpt":"我申請了期權交易和保證金。我要求完全的3級權限，像\n大狗。大約一週後，他們給我發了一封郵件，讓我給他們打電話。I\n假設嘲笑我，說我是白癡，因爲在申請書上我必須...\n把我從來沒有交易的選項，是一個白癡。所以我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-386aab04-8234-5bf1-bc84-e4286ba993f2","excerpt":"I see many paper-handed individuals dumping their shares for cheap because OMG\nBB has missed its revenue expectations for Q4.
