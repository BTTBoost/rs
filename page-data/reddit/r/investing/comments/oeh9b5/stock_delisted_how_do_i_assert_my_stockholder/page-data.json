They went private on purpose. It is an Irish based (but actually mostly US) company called Mainstay Medical. If all goes well they&#39;ll most likely go public again at some point in the future, most likely with a US listing.</p>\n\n<p>Now my EU based broker (DeGiro) kept the stock listed in my account for the shares I own (worth a couple of thousand euro&#39;s when i bought them), but the worth was set to zero and it was marked non-tradeable. I was told by customer service the line was still in my account because &quot;our custodian still keeps the record of stockholders&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Now fast forward 15 months and they removed the line from my account today. So basically I now feel pretty vulnerable and like I need to make sure my ownership of the shares can still be proven and remains intact. Of course I sent my broker an e-mail already and waiting for a response, but I would appreciate some more input. I&#39;m pretty sure my broker can basically tell me to figure it out myself now, because they have nothing to do with this company anymore. </p>\n\n<p>So my question is, does anybody have experience in this field and know the proper course of action for me? There is lots of info on Google about stock delistings, but I find nothing about how to assert your rights when you&#39;re all of a sudden a private shareholder. Who even keeps the record or knows who owns which shares at this point? I guess I can simply contact the company myself, but I would like to know what I need from them and what to expect from them before I do that.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: To be clear. This company delisted but left all the shareholders intact. The shares were not bought back to then go private and the company didn&#39;t go bust.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT2: Here is the press release from when the delisting was finalized</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>In accordance with the terms of the Scheme, ordinary shareholders of Mainstay Medical International plc (&#39;Mainstay&#39;) at 6.00 p.m. on Thursday, 4 June 2020 will be issued with one Mainstay Holdings Share for every Mainstay plc Share held at such time. Shareholders who held their Mainstay plc Shares in uncertificated form will have their CREST accounts credited with their entitlement to Mainstay Holdings Shares on Monday, 8 June 2020.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Shareholders who held their Mainstay plc Shares in certificated form will be issued with share\ncertificates in respect of their Mainstay Holdings Shares in June 2020.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Shareholders are advised that all instructions, mandates, elections, communication preferences and group requirements relating to notices and other communications in respect of ordinary shares in effect on 5 June 2020 will, unless and until varied or revoked, be deemed to be valid and effective mandates or instructions to Mainstay Holdings in relation to the corresponding holding of Mainstay Holdings Shares.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Cancellation of listing of Mainstay plc Shares</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Mainstay plc Shares will be delisted from trading on Euronext Paris and the Euronext Growth market of Euronext Dublin with effect from 7.00 a.m. on 8 June 2020. Mainstay plc Shares in uncertificated form have been disabled in CREST.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT3:</strong> I guess I&#39;m getting some clues from the press release myself as I posted it. I just found that &quot;CREST is the central securities depository and settlement system for the UK and Ireland.&quot; I&#39;m assuming I had uncertified shares, held at CREST on behalf of me (in nominee) in the name of my broker DeGiro. So I guess I need to start there and ask for these shares to be put in my name somehow.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oeh9b5/stock_delisted_how_do_i_assert_my_stockholder/","title":"Stock delisted, how do I assert my stockholder rights?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-06T01:44:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-06 01:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b5cd4f1b-5558-5945-9abd-63069805318a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oeh9b5/stock_delisted_how_do_i_assert_my_stockholder/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oeh9b5/stock_delisted_how_do_i_assert_my_stockholder/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"satchelsofgold","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/satchelsofgold","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"satchelsofgold","score":632,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"株式が上場廃止になったが、株主権を主張するにはどうすればよいか？","the_new_excerpt":"私が投資した銘柄が去年、上場廃止になったんですね。わざと非公開にしたらしい。\nこれはアイルランドに本拠地を置く（実際にはほとんどがアメリカ）Mainstay Medicalという会社です。\nもしうまくいけば、彼らは将来のある時点で再び株式を公開することになるでしょう。\n米国で上場することになるでしょう。\n\nさて、私のEUベースのブローカーは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"股票退市，我如何维护我的股东权利？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我投资的一只股票去年被退市了。他们是故意私有化的。\n这是一家位于爱尔兰（但实际上主要是美国）的公司，名为Mainstay Medical。\n如果一切顺利的话，他们很可能在未来的某个时间点再次上市。\n未来，最有可能在美国上市。\n\n现在我在欧盟的经纪人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"股票退市，我如何維護我的股東權利？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我投資的一隻股票去年被退市了。他們是故意私有化的。\n這是一家位於愛爾蘭（但實際上主要是美國）的公司，名爲Mainstay Medical。\n如果一切順利的話，他們很可能在未來的某個時間點再次上市。\n未來，最有可能在美國上市。\n\n現在我在歐盟的經紀人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-66ffcc54-04ca-552d-8309-1095af443032","excerpt":"Hello, I am up about 50% on AAPL and 20% on MSFT.
