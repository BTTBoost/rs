I&#39;m a university student who got laid off due to the pandemic and have yet to find a job since. When meme stocks blew up (BB, AMC, NOK, and GME or BANG) I jumped on the bandwagon thinking it&#39;s a fast way to make gains overnight instead of waiting for a company to grow organically. I spent 80% of what I have to my name and bought out shares of BANG, unfortunately, I have now lost 75% of my initial investment. Really expensive lesson but now I&#39;ve learned and will grow from this and come back stronger. Luckily, I made a deal with my mom when I started university so I don&#39;t have any bills to pay other than phone bill, gym membership, netflix, spotify etc. Just the basic stuff so I can still live off of what I left myself with for at least a few months. I&#39;m also in the last semester for a Computer Information System degree so I&#39;m hoping that I can get a job and get back what I lost. I will be holding my meme stocks until I die as a reminder of my very expensive mistake. If they go up great, if not it&#39;s no big deal as I have come to finally accept that I lost. Just something I wanna get out of my chest to be at peace with myself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcroz5/gme_and_meme_stock_an_expensive_lesson_to_learn/","title":"GME and meme stock an expensive lesson to learn.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T00:46:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 00:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"043097d5-f094-5386-95b2-606b2ef95980","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcroz5/gme_and_meme_stock_an_expensive_lesson_to_learn/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcroz5/gme_and_meme_stock_an_expensive_lesson_to_learn/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"kazamasta31","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kazamasta31","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"kazamasta31","score":915,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME和meme股票昂贵的教训。","the_new_excerpt":"我去年开始交易股票，当电晕发生时，就像其他人一样。\n了。我是一名大学生，因为流行病而下岗，还没有。\n来找工作，因为。当meme股票炸了（BB，AMC，NOK，和GME或BANG），我\n跳上了这个行列，认为这是一个快速的方式，使... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME和meme股票昂貴的教訓。","the_new_excerpt":"我去年開始交易股票，當電暈發生時，就像其他人一樣。\n了。我是一名大學生，因爲流行病而下崗，還沒有。\n來找工作，因爲。當meme股票炸了（BB，AMC，NOK，和GME或BANG），我\n跳上了這個行列，認爲這是一個快速的方式，使... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-14a8c1a5-21dc-5f87-80be-b3ce69939601","excerpt":"So much FUD lately.\nThey want us scared and it is working.\nRetards are becoming normal humans.\nRetards don't get scared.\nI dont see rockets no more.\nWe achieved so much that we forget about the real reason we invested in GME.\nYes tendies matter but we achieved more than that.\nYou guys made more than…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcd4g8/gme_is_not_over/","title":"GME is not over 🚀🚀🚀🚀👐💎","date":"February 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME还没有结束🚀🚀🚀🚀👐💎。","the_new_excerpt":"最近有那么多FUD。\n他们想让我们害怕，这很有效。\n弱智正在变成正常人。\n迟钝的人不会害怕。\n我没看到火箭了\n我们取得了这么多成就，以至于忘记了我们投资GME的真正原因。\n是的 Tendies很重要，但我们取得的成就不止于此。\n你们赚的不止是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME還沒有結束🚀🚀🚀🚀👐💎。","the_new_excerpt":"最近有那麼多FUD。\n他們想讓我們害怕，這很有效。\n弱智正在變成正常人。\n遲鈍的人不會害怕。\n我沒看到火箭了\n我們取得了這麼多成就，以至於忘記了我們投資GME的真正原因。\n是的 Tendies很重要，但我們取得的成就不止於此。\n你們賺的不止是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-54e3c701-6d2b-57e2-84ee-0cbb4cf1eeba","excerpt":"Hello, paste-eating apes of WSB,\n\nThere is a second wave of GME coming and here’s why: after hearing about you\nheroes on the news I decided to open an Etrade account (because this is the\nsecond time I’ve seen Robinhood freeze its own clientele out of fat gainz), and\nthose funds are taking 5 days to…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcfzdf/gme_second_wave/","title":"GME Second Wave","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 05, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME第二波","the_new_excerpt":"你好，WSB的食膏猿。\n\n第二波GME来了，原因是：听闻你的事迹后。\n英雄的新闻，我决定开一个Etrade账户(因为这是一个很好的例子)。\n第二次我看到Robinhood把自己的客户冻结在脂肪增加的地方)，而且。\n这些资金需要5天的时间来...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME第二波","the_new_excerpt":"你好，WSB的食膏猿。\n\n第二波GME來了，原因是：聽聞你的事蹟後。\n英雄的新聞，我決定開一個Etrade賬戶(因爲這是一個很好的例子)。\n第二次我看到Robinhood把自己的客戶凍結在脂肪增加的地方)，而且。\n這些資金需要5天的時間來...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-043097d5-f094-5386-95b2-606b2ef95980","previousId":"RedditPost-14a8c1a5-21dc-5f87-80be-b3ce69939601","nextId":"RedditPost-54e3c701-6d2b-57e2-84ee-0cbb4cf1eeba","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcroz5/gme_and_meme_stock_an_expensive_lesson_to_learn/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
