The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps outperformed, closing the day 1.48% higher. Market participants continue to digest the evolving situations in China and a bevy of news coming out of Congress. </p>\n\n<p>The Evergrande situation has been covered in detail in previous recaps, but there are a few updates. The company announced it was canceling plans to issue shares of its electric vehicle unit on the Shanghai stock exchange and its wealth management arm is facing an inquiry by the local government. </p>\n\n<p>In other news, a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country’s electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904\">https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904</a></p>\n\n<p>There are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. </p>\n\n<p>Publicly traded companies, including suppliers for Apple (AAPL) and one to Tesla (TSLA), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) issued statements on Sunday night warning that their factories were among those affected. Apple had no immediate comment, while Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-power-outages-pose-new-threat-to-supplies-of-chips-and-other-goods-11632769617\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-power-outages-pose-new-threat-to-supplies-of-chips-and-other-goods-11632769617</a></p>\n\n<p>In the US, Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. </p>\n\n<p>Congress is set to vote tonight on a bill that would extend government funding through December while also raising or suspending the debt limit until the end of next year to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt, which would be disastrous. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would oppose raising the debt ceiling. </p>\n\n<p>McConnell said he would support a clean stop-gap bill in order to avoid a government shutdown said he “will not provide Republican votes for raising the debt limit.” Wednesday of last week, however, McConnell said, “America must never default -- we never have and we never will”, as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase. </p>\n\n<p>David Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note this morning, “Speaker Pelosi and Senate Schumer announced that they will move forward with legislation that ties an extension of government spending authority to a suspension of the debt limit. Our political economist believes that the likelihood of a government shutdown increases the longer Democrats pursue this course. However, we find no major consistent reaction of the S&amp;P 500 to government shutdowns since 1980.”</p>\n\n<p>Here is a very informative article by the Associated Press: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c\">https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c</a></p>\n\n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said yesterday the chamber would vote Thursday on the bipartisan infrastructure deal, which the Senate passed last month. This would be the same day that lawmakers need to come to an agreement to fund the government to avoid a partial shutdown, which would take place Friday at 12:01 a.m. ET if nothing is done. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Along with the news of power constraints in China, analysts at JP Morgan raised estimates for how long it will take customers to get the new iPhone 13, saying it will likely take more than four weeks for the pro models and 2 weeks for the base model.</li>\n<li>XLF, an ETF that tracks the performance of banks in the SPY, vastly outperformed the market today, closing 1.39% higher amid continued strength by financial stocks.<br/>\nFacebook (FB) pauses the “Instagram for kids” project after lawmakers and the public voiced valid concerns. </li>\n<li>Facebook (FB) also said it will invest $50 million to partner with organizations/companies to build the “metaverse”, which is the name for a 3D, interactive, collaborative virtual space. In the latest earnings call Zuckerberg said “It is going to require very significant investment over many years”. I’m sure we will see many more headlines about this in year to come.</li>\n<li>Order of durable goods, which are goods meant to last at least three years, in the US far exceeded estimates in August, suggesting that demand remains very strong despite supply-chain disruptions. Orders rose 1.8% in August, much higher than estimates of a gain of 0.7% and the 0.5% gain recorded in July.</li>\n<li>Google criticized EU anti-trust regulators for ignoring Apple as it launches an attempt to get the second-higher cort to annul a record $5.1 billion fine related to its Android operating system. Regulators allege that in 2011, Google used Android to cement its dominance in internet search.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Accenture (ACN) target raised by Barclays from $335 to $384 at Overweight.
