That´s my second analysis for AAPL, the last one was from May. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.</p>\n\n<p>Today we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow.</p>\n\n<p>This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.</p>\n\n<p>First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around <strong>50%</strong> of their sales comes from the <strong>iPhone</strong>. The <strong>Mac</strong> makes up around <strong>11%</strong>, the <strong>iPad</strong> around <strong>9%</strong>, <strong>Services</strong> around <strong>19%</strong> and <strong>Wearables, Home and Accessories</strong> around <strong>11%</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For the valuation:</p>\n\n<p>We take <strong>analyst estimates</strong>, we discount that by our <strong>required return of 8%</strong>. Then we use the <strong>perpetual growth rate of 2,5%</strong> and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of <strong>$99 per share</strong>. But because we have to account for <strong>Apple´s debt</strong> as well, our <strong>fair value of equity</strong> would be <strong>$94 per share</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.</p>\n\n<p>With Apple´s price being at <strong>$160</strong> <strong>per share</strong> right now, it´s a little too high. That´s why I don´t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years.</strong> We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the <strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)</strong>, the <strong>Estimated Growth Rate</strong> and the <strong>Future P/E Value</strong>. With this method I get a stock price of <strong>$293 per share</strong> which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That´s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I´ll do.</strong> I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to <strong>dollar-cost-average</strong>. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don´t double in 5 years, I´m rather bullish on this company.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r576vm/is_aapl_a_good_buy_right_now/","title":"Is AAPL a good buy right now?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-30T01:13:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-30 01:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r576vm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r576vm/is_aapl_a_good_buy_right_now/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r576vm/is_aapl_a_good_buy_right_now/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"PeekingPotato","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PeekingPotato","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PeekingPotato","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AAPLは今、買いなのか？","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは！私は株の分析を始めたばかりで、私もやってみようと思いました。\nして、ここに投稿しようと思いました。AAPLの分析はこれで2回目です。\n5月のものです。もしご意見があれば、それは素晴らしいことで、非常に感謝します。\n大変ありがたいです。もし質問があれば、遠慮なく聞いてください。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"AAPL现在是一个好的买点吗？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们，我刚刚开始更多的分析股票，我想我将尝试\n并在这里发表。这是我对AAPL的第二次分析，最后一次是\n5月份的。如果你对我有任何反馈意见，那将是非常好的。\n感谢。如果你有问题，请随时提出，我将尽力解决。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AAPL現在是一個好的買點嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們，我剛剛開始更多的分析股票，我想我將嘗試\n並在這裏發表。這是我對AAPL的第二次分析，最後一次是\n5月份的。如果你對我有任何反饋意見，那將是非常好的。\n感謝。如果你有問題，請隨時提出，我將盡力解決。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r51mb7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r51mb7/jack_dorsey_resigns_to_focus_on_his_beard/","title":"Jack Dorsey resigns to focus on his beard","date":"November 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ジャック・ドーシー、ヒゲに専念するために辞任","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"杰克-多尔西辞职，专注于他的胡须","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"傑克-多爾西辭職，專注於他的鬍鬚","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1465454012250132487","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1465454012250132487","title":"UK NOW RECOMMENDING COVID BOOSTER EVERY 3 MONTHS\nhttps://t.co/UKOndcb7la","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 30, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"英国、コヴィッドブースターを3ヶ月ごとに推奨開始\nhttps://t.co/UKOndcb7la","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"英国现在建议每3个月进行一次covid强化治疗\nhttps://t.co/UKOndcb7la","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"英國現在建議每3個月進行一次covid強化治療\nhttps://t.co/UKOndcb7la","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-r576vm","previousId":"RedditPost-r51mb7","nextId":"TweetPost-1465454012250132487","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r576vm/is_aapl_a_good_buy_right_now/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
