As many of you probably know, Cathy&#39;s investment strategy is based on Wright&#39;s law, which states that for every cumulative doubling of units produced, costs decline at a consistent rate. According to Cathy, ARK&#39;s research strategy starts by discovering when the costs in various innovative industries have declined to a low enough point to indicate exponential growth in that industry, and therefore the leading companies in that industry. </p>\n\n<p>Seems simple enough, but I&#39;m curious as to how a retail investor would ever be able to find the relevant information to use a similar strategy. I can only assume that ARK has tons of research vehicles in play to analyze how quickly costs change and at what price level customers will start entering into the market. I&#39;ve been trying to think if there is a way to find this information in a companies financials, maybe hidden within some relationship of numbers but I just don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have anything to contribute? I&#39;m really just curious if other people have gone down this path and whether they have gotten anywhere with it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kdsof0/ark_discussion/","title":"ARK discussion","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 16, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-16T06:42:40.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-16 06:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8683176b-0ebe-5393-aa39-1fdf4a95d57d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kdsof0/ark_discussion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kdsof0/ark_discussion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"gravy_train99","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gravy_train99","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"gravy_train99","score":80,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"方舟讨论","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，\n\n像你们中的许多人一样，我一直在关注凯西·伍兹和方舟投资公司\n最近。你们中的许多人可能都知道，凯西的投资策略是基于\n赖特定律指出，单位产量每累计翻一番，\n成本以一致的速度下降。据凯西说，…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"方舟討論","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，\n\n像你們中的許多人一樣，我一直在關注凱西·伍茲和方舟投資公司\n最近。你們中的許多人可能都知道，凱西的投資策略是基於\n賴特定律指出，單位產量每累計翻一番，\n成本以一致的速度下降。據凱西說，…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-afa0437d-c00b-5657-a22f-c63b50daa8f9","excerpt":"Canadian cannabis producers Aphria Inc. and Tilray Inc. are in advanced talks to\ncombine, with an announcement possible as early as this week, according to\nsources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe merged company is expected to retain the Tilray name and appoint Aphria\nChief Executive Officer Irwin…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kdvshi/apha_skyrockets_20_ah_after_news_of_blockbuster/","title":"APHA skyrockets 20% AH after news of blockbuster merger with Tilray","date":"December 16, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"APHA在与Tilray重磅合并的消息传出后飙升20%AH","the_new_excerpt":"加拿大大麻生产商Aphria Inc.和Tilray Inc.正在进行深入的谈判，以\n合并，最早可能在本周宣布，根据\n知情人士说。\n\n合并后的公司预计将保留Tilray的名字，并任命Aphria\n首席执行官Irwin…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"APHA在與Tilray重磅合併的消息傳出後飆升20%AH","the_new_excerpt":"加拿大大麻生產商Aphria Inc.和Tilray Inc.正在進行深入的談判，以\n合併，最早可能在本週宣佈，根據\n知情人士說。\n\n合併後的公司預計將保留Tilray的名字，並任命Aphria\n首席執行官Irwin…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1333944194445021186","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1333944194445021186","title":"We might never see anything like this again in our lifetimes.\n\nhttps://t.co/IFvsoBJeoP","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 16, 2020","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"在我们的有生之年，我们可能再也看不到这样的事情了。\n\nhttps://t.co/IFvsoBJeoP","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"在我們的有生之年，我們可能再也看不到這樣的事情了。\n\nhttps://t.co/IFvsoBJeoP","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-8683176b-0ebe-5393-aa39-1fdf4a95d57d","previousId":"RedditPost-afa0437d-c00b-5657-a22f-c63b50daa8f9","nextId":"TweetPost-1333944194445021186","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kdsof0/ark_discussion/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
