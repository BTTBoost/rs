But does anyone feel like or better yet have any evidence that we are fucked? By that I mean that are we headed for a market collapse worse than 08?</p>\n\n<p>From what is happening, inflation going to 30 year record, Chinese housing market collapsing, supply shortages, labor shortages, govt that seems to be sitting on a very large dildo, it seems like all of this is not going to end well. </p>\n\n<p>Is all of this going to lead to an I am Legend scenario without the zombies or is the fed just going to keep lying and is everyone just going to not care at all.</p>\n\n<p>From my position it seems that all the shit happening cannot last forever and it has to come crumbling down some time. But I am also very stupid. Any input welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I would like to also add that everyone always thought “oh I live in America where everything is made of sunshine and rainbows” but recently people have woken up to the fact that we are vulnerable to the same shit the third world countries have been dealing with for years. So if you think you are protected just because you live in a nice neighborhood, you are wrong. And you can primarily blame the government for that.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: of all the people saying “oh people have been saying this for years” or “just another gay bear.” None of those people have offered any evidence that I’m wrong, which I find interesting. And you dorks just saying “we had 12 green days in a row” that literally proves my point. That the market is stupid and not based on anything close to resembling fundamentals and that this market is simply unsustainable.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr9ri8/are_we_heading_down_the_shitter/","title":"Are we heading down the shitter?","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T13:17:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 13:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qr9ri8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr9ri8/are_we_heading_down_the_shitter/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr9ri8/are_we_heading_down_the_shitter/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"ILostAlotOfTendies","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ILostAlotOfTendies","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ILostAlotOfTendies","score":1038,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"このままではダメになってしまう？","the_new_excerpt":"純粋な質問です。ここにいる皆さんはただのギャンブラーで、私を含めて誰も知らないことを知っています。\n自分も含めてね。しかし、誰もがそう感じていて、もっと言えば何か証拠があるのでしょうか？\n何か証拠はありますか？つまり、私たちは2008年よりもひどい市場崩壊に向かっているということです。\nつまり、2008年よりもひどい市場崩壊に向かっているということです。\n\n今起こっていることは、インフレ率が30...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们是否正在走向衰败？","the_new_excerpt":"这里有一个真正的问题。我知道这里的每个人都只是一个赌徒，没有人知道\n狗屎，包括我自己。但有没有人觉得，或者最好是有任何\n证据表明我们已经完蛋了？我的意思是，我们是否正在走向一个比08年更糟糕的市场\n崩溃，比08年还严重？\n\n从目前发生的情况来看，通货膨胀率将达到30...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們是否正在走向衰敗？","the_new_excerpt":"這裏有一個真正的問題。我知道這裏的每個人都只是一個賭徒，沒有人知道\n狗屎，包括我自己。但有沒有人覺得，或者最好是有任何\n證據表明我們已經完蛋了？我的意思是，我們是否正在走向一個比08年更糟糕的市場\n崩潰，比08年還嚴重？\n\n從目前發生的情況來看，通貨膨脹率將達到30...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qrie43","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrie43/bought_the_wish_dip_months_ago/","title":"Bought the WISH dip months ago","date":"November 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WISHのディップを購入したのは数ヶ月前","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"几个月前买了 \"愿望 \"牌浸剂","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"幾個月前買了 \"願望 \"牌浸劑","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1458716009645420546","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1458716009645420546","title":"Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose vaccine plunged from 86% to just 13% protection against COVID over 6 months ***","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 11, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ジョンソン・アンド・ジョンソン社の単回接種ワクチンは、6ヶ月間でCOVIDに対する防御率が86%からわずか13%にまで低下した。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"强生公司的单剂量疫苗在6个月内对COVID的保护率从86%骤降到只有13% ***。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"強生公司的單劑量疫苗在6個月內對COVID的保護率從86%驟降到只有13% ***。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qr9ri8","previousId":"RedditPost-qrie43","nextId":"TweetPost-1458716009645420546","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr9ri8/are_we_heading_down_the_shitter/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
