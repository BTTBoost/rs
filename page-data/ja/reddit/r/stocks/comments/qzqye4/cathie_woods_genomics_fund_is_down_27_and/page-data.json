The fund is down 27% year-to-date as investors shun health-care stocks in favor for more cyclical names that perform well during an economic recovery. Even so, the ETF is faring far worse than the broader biotech sector, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index up 10.49% this year.</p>\n\n<p>ARKG is currently trading at $66.38 a share, lower than its level a year ago, before a steep rally that crested early in 2021. The genomics fund has also seen the largest outflows among Ark’s ETFs this year.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s interesting that typically loyal Ark investors have been bailing on the ETF,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an advisory firm. “The fund’s assets have been chopped in half since February. While I don’t believe the ETF is experiencing some of sort of ‘doom loop,’ clearly the outflows are putting downward price pressure on the underlying holdings and testing the will of remaining fund owners.”</p>\n\n<p>The ETF’s two top holdings, Teladoc Health Inc. and Exact Sciences Corp., have weighed on its performance, with drops of some 45% and 37% this year, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>The recent outflows may be due to investors looking for shorter-term opportunities into the year-end and freeing up cash, said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.</p>\n\n<p>Ark Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood is well-known for prioritizing longer term investments over short-term gains.</p>\n\n<p>“This is a 5-10 year hold. AI in health care is going to change the way that we can predict, treat and manage the most difficult diseases like cancer, and the Ark fund gives investors access to the companies who are on the cutting edge of that research,” said Jablonski.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-genomics-fund-is-down-27-and-outflows-are-growing-1.1685602\">https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-genomics-fund-is-down-27-and-outflows-are-growing-1.1685602</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qzqye4/cathie_woods_genomics_fund_is_down_27_and/","title":"Cathie Wood’s Genomics Fund Is Down 27% and Outflows Are Growing","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-22T19:36:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-22 19:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qzqye4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qzqye4/cathie_woods_genomics_fund_is_down_27_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qzqye4/cathie_woods_genomics_fund_is_down_27_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rockinoutwith2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rockinoutwith2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rockinoutwith2","score":47,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"キャシー・ウッドのジェノミクス・ファンドは27％減、流出が拡大中","the_new_excerpt":"ブルームバーグ） -- アーク・インベストメント・マネージメントのゲノミック・ファンドに、投資家は我慢できなくなっているようだ。\nマネジメントのゲノミクスファンドに我慢できなくなっているようだ。\n\nアーク・ゲノミック・レボリューションETF（ティッカー：ARKG）は、リターンが低迷する中、11月に約5億2000万ドルの流出があった。\nリターンが低下する中、11月には約5億2000万ドルの資金流出が発生した。このファンドは年初来で27％の下落となっています。\n投資家がヘルスケア関連銘柄を敬遠しているためです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"凯西-伍德的基因组学基金下跌27%，资金流出不断增加","the_new_excerpt":"彭博社）--投资者似乎正在失去对方舟投资的耐心。\n管理公司的基因组学基金失去耐心。\n\n方舟基因组革命ETF（股票代码ARKG）在11月出现了大约5.2亿美元的资金外流，因为该基金下挫。\n11月，在回报率下降的情况下，资金流出。该基金今年迄今下跌了27%，因为\n投资者避开了医疗保健类股票...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"凱西-伍德的基因組學基金下跌27%，資金流出不斷增加","the_new_excerpt":"彭博社）--投資者似乎正在失去對方舟投資的耐心。\n管理公司的基因組學基金失去耐心。\n\n方舟基因組革命ETF（股票代碼ARKG）在11月出現了大約5.2億美元的資金外流，因爲該基金下挫。\n11月，在回報率下降的情況下，資金流出。該基金今年迄今下跌了27%，因爲\n投資者避開了醫療保健類股票...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qzr8i6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzr8i6/wsj_jpmorgan_sues_tesla_musk_responds/","title":"WSJ: JPMorgan sues Tesla, Musk responds","date":"November 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WSJ: JPMorganがTeslaを提訴、Muskが対応","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"华尔街日报》。摩根大通起诉特斯拉，马斯克作出回应","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"華爾街日報》。摩根大通起訴特斯拉，馬斯克作出迴應","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qzoo3t","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzoo3t/750_73k_3_week/","title":"750 -> 73k 3 week","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 22, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":null}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qzqye4","previousId":"RedditPost-qzr8i6","nextId":"RedditPost-qzoo3t","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qzqye4/cathie_woods_genomics_fund_is_down_27_and/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
