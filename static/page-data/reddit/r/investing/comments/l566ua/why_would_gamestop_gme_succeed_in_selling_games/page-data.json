This worked well for Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo because they didn&#39;t have to deal with running a retail business; it was cost effective to just give a cut to GME. The gaming console companies were effectively paying Gamestop for the service of running stores to sell their games. In the digital world however, why would someone buy games from Gamestop when they could just buy it on the Playstation Store or the Nintendo eShop? I don&#39;t know a single person who buys iOS apps outside the Apple App Store.
