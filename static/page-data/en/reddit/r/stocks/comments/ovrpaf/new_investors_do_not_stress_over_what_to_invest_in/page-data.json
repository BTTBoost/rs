I did a ton of reading on the subject. I spent hours fretting over:</p>\n\n<p><em>Should I choose spy?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Wait, this expert says vti is better!</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Hold up! This guy claims voo + vxus is king!</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Vt and chill you say?!</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Wait, what’s the difference between spy and voo?</em></p>\n\n<p>You get the idea…</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter which one you choose. There are several variations of “the gold standard of investing” and they are all relatively similar. And here’s the kicker: It is foolish to say one is better than the other, because what does “better” even mean? Does it mean it will perform better? Does it mean it is more diversified and carries less risk? But if it has less risk, it may perform worse in the long run, so is it really better?</p>\n\n<p>The point here is that <strong>no one knows which version of “investing 101” will end up with the best performance 30 years down the road.</strong> Each classic, index-fund-based choice is likely to perform relatively close to its peers in the long run. It’s not like any of them are going to heavily outperform the other. Just choose one and sleep soundly knowing that your money is safe (long term) and will absolutely grow (long term), somewhere in the 8-10%/year range over 30 years. </p>\n\n<p>I think it’s still great to learn about each option, if you find it interesting. I enjoyed learning about the various options. If you enjoy it, learn it! If you don’t, then just choose ANY of the classic strategies and call it a day. Expect to double your money every 7-10ish years. Don’t stress. Investing is actually one of the easiest things in the world to do. It need not be complex. </p>\n\n<p>Redditors on investing subs are often passionate about which version of index fund investing is “best.” It’s cool. It’s all healthy discussion. But don’t let “stonkboy69_420” stress you out just because he’s convinced VT is king of kings. Became in reality, no one knows which one is king, and the differences between each option will end up being minimal anyway. </p>\n\n<p>One other tidbit: If you are investing for retirement in a 401k or similar, and just want to choose the “best choice” and “set it and forget it,” consider a target date fund. For example, if you plan on retiring in 2060, choose the fund that is set up for that specific date. It automatically rebalances and gets less risky as you get older and closer to retirement. It’s managed by a robot/algorithm and is a great option for anyone. I use one myself in my 457b.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ovrpaf/new_investors_do_not_stress_over_what_to_invest_in/","title":"New investors… DO NOT stress over what to invest in.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-01T14:39:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-01 14:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d818358f-61bc-5b60-8dfe-d689b9d1310a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ovrpaf/new_investors_do_not_stress_over_what_to_invest_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ovrpaf/new_investors_do_not_stress_over_what_to_invest_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"NoIdeaWhatImDoing___","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoIdeaWhatImDoing___","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"NoIdeaWhatImDoing___","score":106,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"新しい投資家の皆さん...何に投資するかでストレスを感じないでください。","the_new_excerpt":"昨年のこの時期、私は新規投資家でした。私はこのテーマについてたくさんの本を読みました。\n読んでいました。何時間も悩んでいました。\n\nスパイを選ぶべきか？\n\n待てよ、この専門家はvtiの方が良いと言っているぞ。\n\nちょっと待ってください。この人はvoo＋vxusが王道だと言っている！？\n\nVtとchillって言うのか！？\n\n待てよ スパイとVooの違いは何だ？\n\nお前...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"新的投资者......不要为投资什么而紧张。","the_new_excerpt":"去年这个时候，我是一个新的投资者。我在这方面做了大量的阅读\n主题。我花了好几个小时的时间来纠结。\n\n我应该选择间谍吗？\n\n等等，这个专家说vti更好!\n\n等一下! 这个人声称voo + vxus才是王道!\n\n你说Vt和chill？\n\n等等，spy和voo之间有什么区别？\n\n你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新的投資者......不要爲投資什麼而緊張。","the_new_excerpt":"去年這個時候，我是一個新的投資者。我在這方面做了大量的閱讀\n主題。我花了好幾個小時的時間來糾結。\n\n我應該選擇間諜嗎？\n\n等等，這個專家說vti更好!\n\n等一下! 這個人聲稱voo + vxus纔是王道!\n\n你說Vt和chill？\n\n等等，spy和voo之間有什麼區別？\n\n你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-15be2168-64cb-5765-8ef6-d94bbf121a97","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ovs5gn/closed_to_new_accounts_since_2013_vanguard/","title":"Closed to new accounts since 2013, Vanguard Wellington Fund has reopened","date":"August 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2013年より新規口座開設を停止していたバンガード・ウェリントン・ファンドが再開されました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"自2013年起对新账户关闭，Vanguard Wellington基金已重新开放","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"自2013年起對新賬戶關閉，Vanguard Wellington基金已重新開放","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-b88ec583-3a2f-5cea-b0a8-86a1b94f8dbb","excerpt":"What do you think about MSFT getting this upgrade?
