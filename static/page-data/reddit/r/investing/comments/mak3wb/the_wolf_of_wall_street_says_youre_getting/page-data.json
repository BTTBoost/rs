It was like a betrayal of trust.&quot; He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker&#39;s prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. &quot;Order flow is everything,&quot; he says. &quot;It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information  disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn&#39;t have.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>..  </p>\n\n<p>In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm &quot;worked the order&quot; by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on  behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢  instead of 8¢. &quot;Traders&#39; compensation depends on marking up trades and  keeping wide spreads,&quot; he says. &quot;You&#39;d have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html\">How Robinhood (and the other brokerages that have followed them) Make Money on Trades Despite Taking No Commissions</a></p>\n\n<p>What is Payment for Order Flow?  <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp\">Investopedia Article</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>..payment for order flow is a practice pioneered by <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp\">Bernard Madoff</a>—the same Madoff of Ponzi scheme notoriety.  </p>\n\n<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said, in a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/ordpay.htm\">special study</a> on PFOF published in December 2000, “Payment for order flow is a method of transferring some of the trading profits from market making to the brokers that route customer orders to specialists for execution.”   </p>\n\n<p>Payment for order flow (PFOF) is the compensation a broker receives for routing trades for trade execution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/payment-for-order-flow-in-the-united-kingdom\">Payment for Order Flow is banned in the UK</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/content/dam/gbm/market-insights/etf/october/2019-10-02-Free-Trading.pdf\">Payment for Order Flow is also not permitted in Canada</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mak3wb/the_wolf_of_wall_street_says_youre_getting/","title":"The Wolf of Wall Street Says You're Getting Fleeced By The Brokers and Market Makers","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T11:46:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 11:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d8a97333-a163-5a82-847b-0c219084b095","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mak3wb/the_wolf_of_wall_street_says_youre_getting/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mak3wb/the_wolf_of_wall_street_says_youre_getting/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"givemeyourpants","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/givemeyourpants","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"givemeyourpants","score":232,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"华尔街之狼说你被经纪人和做市商骗了","the_new_excerpt":"财富》专访 \"华尔街之狼 \"乔丹-贝尔福特。\n[https://fortune.com/2021/03/21/bitcoin-stock-market-jordan-belfort-small-investors-wolf-of-wall-street-interview/]\n\n> \"这是你能拥有的最昂贵的'自由贸易'，\"贝尔福特说。\"我看到一个\n>营销演示从一个大的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"華爾街之狼說你被經紀人和做市商騙了","the_new_excerpt":"財富》專訪 \"華爾街之狼 \"喬丹-貝爾福特。\n[https://fortune.com/2021/03/21/bitcoin-stock-market-jordan-belfort-small-investors-wolf-of-wall-street-interview/]\n\n> \"這是你能擁有的最昂貴的'自由貿易'，\"貝爾福特說。\"我看到一個\n>營銷演示從一個大的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-29719ce9-4508-52c1-a4e0-8d839dd8b132","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maj66z/how_it_feels_holding_gme_through_short_attacks/","title":"How it feels holding GME through short attacks, FUD, shill account posts, ETF shorting, darkpool trading, trading halts, trading app restrictions, congressional hearings.","date":"March 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"通过空头攻击、FUD、骗子账户帖子、ETF做空、暗池交易、交易停止、交易应用限制、国会听证会，持有GME的感觉如何。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"通過空頭攻擊、FUD、騙子賬戶帖子、ETF做空、暗池交易、交易停止、交易應用限制、國會聽證會，持有GME的感覺如何。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c5d25b37-12b3-5571-9c66-996951e69f7a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mahjsq/check_back_my_post_i_held_at_480_i_held_at_40/","title":"Check back my post.
