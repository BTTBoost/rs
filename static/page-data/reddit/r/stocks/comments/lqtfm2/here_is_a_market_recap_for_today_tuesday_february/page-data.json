After opening deep in the red, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) was able to reverse to close marginally positive. The sell-off in technology stocks continued, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) once again underperforming. The recent pressure on the market comes after a spike in the 10-year Treasury yield that has market participants concerned that inflation will begin to rise. </p>\n\n<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered his semiannual monetary policy testimony, offering another update on his view for the path forward for monetary policy during and after the pandemic. In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, &quot;The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>In Washington, The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee voted to advance President Joe Biden&#39;s $1.9 trillion virus relief proposal on Monday, bringing it a step closer to passage ahead of a mid-March cliff, after which federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. </p>\n\n<p>In the last week or two, market participants have been eyeing a sharp spike in Treasury yields, raising concerns of a surge in borrowing costs and inflationary pressures in the post-pandemic economy. The benchmark 10-year yield hovered around 1.36% for its highest level in a year, after wallowing below 1% for most of 2020. That said, the Treasury yield remains at historically low levels. While we expect the spike in the yield to put pressure on the market, our long-term bull thesis remains intact.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The U.S. Postal Service said Tuesday it would award a multi-billion-dollar, 10-year contract to Oshkosh Defense to manufacture a new generation of postal delivery vehicles. Shares of Workhorse (WKHS), another company that was vying for that contract, plummeted more than 40% after the deal was announced.</li>\n<li>Shares of Snapchat (SNAP) reached all-time highs after the company provided an optimistic outlook on ad revenue and customer growth.</li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) is planning to increase dividend according to Chief Executive Tim Cook, CNBC reported on Tuesday, citing the shareholder meeting.</li>\n<li>Facebook said late Monday it will restore news content to its platform in Australia.
