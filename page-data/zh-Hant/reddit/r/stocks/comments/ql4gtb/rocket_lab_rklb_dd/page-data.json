It is currently trading at $14.33/share. They have launched 20 times (18 successful) putting 105 satellites in orbit. <a href=\"https://www.rocketlabusa.com/\">https://www.rocketlabusa.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Rocket Lab has two main businesses: as a launch provider and satellite manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p>Launch Provider:</p>\n\n<p>Rocket Lab’s current vehicle is called Electron. It is a small-lift vehicle capable of putting 300kg into LEO (Low Earth Orbit) at $7.5 million launch cost. The purpose of a vehicle this small is as a dedicated ride for small satellites, which historically have had to ride as secondary payloads on larger vehicles. A dedicated, small-sat launcher priorities these customers who have had to wait years to hitch a ride on a medium to heavy lift launcher when there was room. The only operational competitor to Electron is Virgin Orbit’s Launcher One (500kg to LEO at $12 million). However, there are a multitude of companies promising small sat launchers at a smaller cost such as Astra (630kg to LEO at $2.5 million, although this rocket has failed to reach orbit 4 times it is getting very close), Firefly’s Alpha (1000kg to LEO at $15 million, again this vehicle failed to reach orbit the one time it was launched) among many others preparing for their first launch. The launch market is not that elastic and it is clear not all of these vehicles will survive in the market. So, Rocket Lab has begun to embrace reusability to lower launch costs for Electron by catching the first stage out of the air with a helicopter, an unusual approach, but one that negates the need for heavy landing legs on the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>The company’s upcoming vehicle is Neutron, a medium lift launcher capable of 8000kg to LEO. Nothing is known about Neutron’s design, except that the vehicle will be ‘nearly 100% reusable’. Rocket Lab plans to have it operational by 2024. If the rocket lives up to expectations, there will be a duopoly on the medium lift market: Neutron and SpaceX’s Falcon 9. This is far more sustainable than the small lift launch market. This rocket is also at the size to be feasible to launch satellite constellations, of which there are many in planning. Rocket Lab has also said that Neutron will be capable of human spaceflight. This is incredibly exciting and presents huge opportunities for government contracts and tourist missions as SpaceX is currently the only American entity capable of putting humans in orbit.</p>\n\n<p>Space Systems:</p>\n\n<p>Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and every other launch provider have all realized the same thing: there isn’t actually that much money in launching satellites for customers. SpaceX has negated this by becoming their own customer by launching hundreds of Starlink satellites to become and internet provider. Rocket Lab has also moved into the place where in the real money is in the industry: satellite manufacturing. Along with acquiring two companies for selling both software and hardware to other companies, they have developed their own ‘kickstage’ called Photon (starting to see a naming pattern?). Photon is genius as Electron would never be able to send a satellite to the Moon, Mars, or beyond as it is simply to small. Instead they launch a satellite on Photon to LEO. Then, Photon can transport that payload to anywhere in the solar system. It is like a third stage that is launched with the rocket instead of part of it. The important thing here is that <em>it can launched on other vehicles.</em> If Falcon 9 or any other rocket can’t get a customer’s payload to it’s required destination due to any multitude of reasons, Photon can be launched with the payload to complete the mission. This could be a huge revenue driver for Rocket Lab in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Financial Results:</p>\n\n<p>Rocket Lab did an Investor Presentation for their first half of 2021 which included some impressive numbers. In one year, they have gone from a $5.9 million deficit to $3.9 million gross margin, while increasing R&amp;D spending by 156%. Their space systems revenue have also increased to 18% of total revenue from 3% last year. The gross margins for space systems is a ridiculous 65%, and I only expect their revenue to grow from here. Their net loss has decreased from $31 million to $23 million in the last year.</p>\n\n<p>Investor Presentation: <a href=\"https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_presentations/2021/09/Rocket-Lab_1H-2021-Financial-Results_FINAL.pdf\">https://s28.q4cdn.com/737637457/files/doc_presentations/2021/09/Rocket-Lab_1H-2021-Financial-Results_FINAL.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>In my opinion this stock is a very strong buy due to huge potential for growth and the company’s ability to access multiple parts of the aerospace market which is forecasted to double by 2030.</p>\n\n<p>The new space race has begun fellas, and this time it’s between companies. I think Rocket Lab has a part to play.</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.
