They invested heavily on original content to draw in subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;While the company (Disney) appears to be targeting one new piece of content a week, not every piece of content has the same franchise value or visibility,&quot; Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar said.</p>\n\n<p>Barclays also said the slowdown in Disney+ subscribers could not be solely attributed to a pull forward in additions in 2020, when streaming platforms gained popularity as people hunkering down at home sought entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve its target of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024, Disney will need to more than double its current pace of growth to at least the same level as Netflix <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/companies/NFLX.O\"><strong>(NFLX.O)</strong></a>, according to Barclays.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix, which is due to report its quarterly results on Tuesday, had 209 million subscribers as of the quarter ended June.
