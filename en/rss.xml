I’ve also analyzed other companies, so feel free to check out my profile for other stock analysis! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that don’t know, Palantir is a software company that specializes in big data analytics. At the time of this post, they’re sitting at about $23.33. They reported earnings for Quarter 3 on November 9th, 2021. Revenue was reported to be $392 million, which is up 35.5% from the same quarter last year, beating expectations by $5.54 million. Furthemore, in Q3 they added 34 new customers and closed 54 deals worth at least $1 million, 33 of which were at least $5 million, and 18 of which were worth at least $10 Million. For Q4, Palantir is expecting $418 Million in revenue, consensus is $401.87 Million. The CEO of PLTR, Alex Karp, said that they expect revenue to grow at a rate of 30% or more for 2021 - 2025. Now let’s discuss their valuation...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since Palantir had a larger number of customers and government deals in Q3, they reported stronger revenue growth, However, growth did lag in comparison to other competitors who are in the same space such as Datadog and Snowflake. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palantir demonstrated the highest value for EBITDA margins compared to other companies in the space. Adjusted free cash flow for quarter 3 was $119 Million, which was a $172 million improvement year-over-year, representing a margin of about 30%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the fact that this company looks like it’s trading at a cheap price compared to its peers, it is trading at 17 to 20x revenue multiples which means that if they happen to have a bad quarter, the stock can drop hard. However, keep in mind that they do seem to be executing pretty well since they’ve been growing the amount of deals they’ve been making with organizations and firms, Have strong revenue growth, and also have good EBITDA margins. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this being said, Palantir may be a buy only if you believe in the company long-term. In order for Palantir to succeed, they will need to grow their commercial product offering, since they already have a good presence on the government side. Things do seem to be going well on that end though because the commercial side growth has been going up as of recently. In my opinion, this company is still trading at too high of a price, your money would be better off invested in a different tech company. Thanks for reading everyone, if you have any questions feel free to comment down below or message me directly. I’d also love to hear your comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucid Air today won the 2022 MotorTrend Car of the Year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer vehicle production started in Q3 at Lucid&amp;#39;s Advanced Manufacturing Plant (&amp;quot;AMP-1&amp;quot;) in Casa Grande, Arizona, and the second phase of construction broke ground to add 2.85 million square feet of space&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucid bolstered its balance sheet to close Q3 with approximately $4.8B in cash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucid Group, Inc. successfully listed as a public company on Nasdaq in July under the ticker symbol LCID&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Quarter Financial Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter of 2021, Lucid significantly strengthened its balance sheet through the closing of the de-SPAC reverse merger + PIPE, bringing approximately $4.4B onto Lucid&amp;#39;s balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued to invest in the business, readying production and deliveries, globalization of our retail network and adding headcount across R&amp;amp;D and SG&amp;amp;A to continue growing our core operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initiated investment in property, plant, and equipment associated with Phase 2 expansion of manufacturing, continued investment in vehicle program development, and ongoing expansion of retail, delivery, and service capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We remain confident in our ability to achieve 20,000 units in 2022. This target is not without risk given ongoing challenges facing the automotive industry, with global disruptions to supply chains and logistics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little comparison.  VW Group is double the mkt cap.  It produces 20,000 cars a day.  Not a week, a month, a year.  A day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has nearly a dozen BEV models on sale worldwide.  It sold nearly 540K EV&amp;#39;s YTD to 3Q 2021.  In 2022 it will have over 20 EV models on sale and likely surpass Tesla in EV sales and be pushing 20,000 EV&amp;#39;s a day (Tesla will stil pip it in BEV&amp;#39;s by measure - and yes PHEV&amp;#39;s do matter making lots of moolah).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20,000 EV&amp;#39;s a day...not a year, a day.  Yet just double the mkt cap.of Lucid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to offend, but US investors are mostly utterly clueless when it comes to global EV mkts.  BYD in China knocked out 183K EV&amp;#39;s in their third quarter alone.  Again it trades for a lowly $130 billion vs Lucid&amp;#39;s absurd mkt cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always heard you can&amp;#39;t beat the market but couldn&amp;#39;t reconcile that with my initial assumption that 50% must be doing better than the other 50%. I mean, I&amp;#39;m smart right? At least smarter than half of you! Then I read Bogle and all the other data showing its single digit % of investors beat the market long term. To understand this I&amp;#39;ve come to a theory that &amp;quot;The Market&amp;quot; is an optimization, not an average. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory: as long as society maintains stability (bigger &amp;quot;if&amp;quot; these days), the economy will grow (for reasons) and thus companies and stocks along with it. There is always churn and noise but over the long term the duds get filtered out and the studs end up making a majority of the market. Even if you&amp;#39;re picking good stocks, so is the broader market. That makes it hard to beat when the market also has your winners every time. It also has mostly winners and very few losers so if you happen to pick one bad stock you can easily get crushed vs the index. The market is continually optimizing so the effort and reward for trying to beat it are not justified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concludes my surface level, non-economist, inexperienced justification for why I consolidated everything into SNDL...j/k, it starts with a V. Please destroy my optimization theory so I can learn about a hammer candle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a pretty high savings rate and hate to leave my dollars working inefficiently. The more I save, the quicker I can reach financial independence. In my 20’s I’ve stayed in 100% stocks and have not purchased any bonds. I have a pretty tough skin and risk tolerance and didn’t even consider selling during the short 2020 market crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I also understand the importance of an emergency fund. I started with around $10,000 in an Ally savings account and have increased it up to $25,000 over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, I’ve considered putting most of my emergency fund into I-bonds. I understand they are less liquid than a savings account but in the long run will be less affected by inflation. Looking at historic rates, they almost always are at least 1-2% higher than a high yield savings account.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/agSHRni&quot;&gt;https://imgur.com/a/agSHRni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pro to an online savings account is only liquidity and money available within a few days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell about I-bonds the pros and cons are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher Inflation Protected Interest Rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locked up for 1 year from time of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forfeit 3 months interest if redeemed within 5 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limited to $10,000 purchased per year &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;May take longer to redeem in an emergency &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I can deal with all of the cons in my current situation. If I purchase 10k this year and 10k towards the end of next year I could limit my exposure to liquidity issues. My plan would be to buy 10k this December, bring my emergency fund savings account back to 20k by next December, then buy 10k more. At that point I would have 20k in I-bonds and 10k in a savings account. Ideally for small emergencies I wouldn’t even have to touch the I-bonds. Even sacrificing 3 months of interest after 1 year I would still be ahead relative to a high yield savings account. 9 months at an I bond rate beats 12 months at current savings accounts rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, 15k liquidity is plenty. I have a local safety net and could both cover a 6-month lease liability ($3750) and the maximum out of pocket for health insurance ($6500). Worst case I could also move back in with parents and just pay for partial utilities and food. My current industry also has a pretty high demand so it wouldn’t be difficult to get another similar paying job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my main concerns is how difficult it is in practice to redeem I-bonds. Could I put a large emergency expense on a credit card, cash in the same amount of electronic I-bonds the same day, and be able to pay off the credit card within 3 weeks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m basically straight VT in my personal brokerage and target-dates in my retirement accounts. Just staying the course in my retirement accounts. For my personal brokerage thus far I&amp;#39;ve stuck with just VT contributions but I&amp;#39;ve upped my monthly contributions significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have about $30K surplus getting ate away at the bank set-aside for a car purchase, but with interest rates being what they are it seems smarter just to finance it (especially if money is losing value). Probably will end up dumping it all into VT but wondering what others are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend CEO Elon Musk said he could sell more stock, in what many saw as an off-color response to a tweet from Senator Bernie Sanders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk sold about $6.9 billion in shares last week, sending the stock price lower. Tesla shares are down more than 15% over the last five sessions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seem Elon will keep selling Telsa stocks this week to finish his 10% goal. Investors can start a small position this week under 1k as tesla is still the industry leader and very far ahead for many competitors. If the stock really drop back to $900, then it could consider to add more position.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the great demand for it, prices are still volatile and the whole situation is pretty messy tbh. It’s somewhat confusing to me because I thought that if the demand is high and producers are struggling to comply, then the prices should go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also thinking if my worries are warranted, especially since I have some copper stocks in my portfolio and I made investments recently too, placing some money in juniors. I know they’re a pretty risky investment, but I always remind myself to invest money I am willing t&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is Oroco Resources (ORRCF) which recently uncovered extensive copper deposits. The drilling activities that commenced in their&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orocoresourcecorp.com/projects/santo-tomas/&quot;&gt; Santo Tomas Project&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the presence of polymetallic copper mineralization. They hold 100% interest in two contiguous mineral concessions in Guerrero, Mexico which are included in their project in Xochipala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also placed some on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threevalleycopper.com/&quot;&gt; Three Valley Copper&lt;/a&gt; (TVC) since they’re pretty much on a roll recently. They will start mining next month or in early 2022 and are expected to have an annual production between 13,000 and 16,000 tonnes of copper cathode by 2023. The company recently announced an upsize with a recent deal financing to $16 million due to investor demand. Also just last month they released their second quarter results where they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m going to hold back from investing despite the price dip because I’m pretty anxious because of the whole situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumor has it, that Rep. Mace (R) from SC is proposing a bill to legalize Marijuana at the Federal level. &amp;quot;Those who’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/republicans-pot-bill-to-propose-lower-taxes-more-state-control&quot;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; Mace’s draft say it would regulate cannabis more like alcohol&amp;quot;. This bill coming from the republican side may garner more support than Sen. Schumer&amp;#39;s already proposed bill. &amp;quot; Mace’s proposed excise tax is 3.75%, according to Cobb -- a fraction of the 25.5% that Schumer’s legislation would put on marijuana products.&amp;quot; Personally, I&amp;#39;ve heard this bill could be brought forward as early as Monday 11/15. But, that&amp;#39;s just chatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, which dank stock should I buy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve looked at various companies and honestly diversifying into a few may be worth it. However, I have the greatest conviction in &lt;strong&gt;$TLRY&lt;/strong&gt; the largest market share in Canada, Germany, and ties to the US with Sweetwater brewing. Those with the greatest dependence on the US may outperform. But, screw the fundamentals because that&amp;#39;s not how this market works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*for simplicity I&amp;#39;ll just illustrate $TLRY to represent the Marijuana sector since it has the largest market cap*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutions buying $420M+?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Institutions have been buying these Cannabis companies as they blew off earlier in the year. Heaviest buying has been in $TLRY with the heaviest selling in $SNDL. Interestingly most of the buys come during Q2 which means most of these institutional apes are holding some serious bags. They could be down anywhere from -4% to -33% depending on when they bought in Q2. So, don&amp;#39;t be surprised if this gets pumped and ultimately dumped to lighten their bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n0904d0bzmz71.png?width=2386&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fb69d29fe355abc07e40a01cc412993d9f8b3b3b&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n0904d0bzmz71.png?width=2386&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fb69d29fe355abc07e40a01cc412993d9f8b3b3b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaders in the Sector?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$ACB&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;$SNDL&lt;/strong&gt; currently lead the move upward as they are right at their 200-day moving average. Does that mean they&amp;#39;ll continue leading the way? I don&amp;#39;t know. Does that mean the others have more to run? I can&amp;#39;t see the future, you twit. As a result, diversifying in this sector might be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crayons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears &lt;strong&gt;$TLRY&lt;/strong&gt; has started to round out and will try to push hire. The green lines are historical supply/demand lines at candle closes. I&amp;#39;m setting my stop near the recent low of $9.98 and will continue to sell out starting at $15.50 to $30.00 for a gain close to between 20% and 130%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cssq7ipczmz71.png?width=2712&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80aa4805f62ae8a139a233ae266c836122544bd9&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cssq7ipczmz71.png?width=2712&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80aa4805f62ae8a139a233ae266c836122544bd9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Traction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I am choosing to look at &lt;strong&gt;$TLRY&lt;/strong&gt; is because of all the weed stocks, &lt;strong&gt;$TLRY&lt;/strong&gt; gains the most attention on google trends and is the 2nd most mentioned on WSB behind &lt;strong&gt;$SNDL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally have none and plan on buying Monday with any of you that like the stock(s). I&amp;#39;ll update after buys are in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*This is literally my uneducated, unlicensed opinion. Don&amp;#39;t listen to me. You&amp;#39;ll Lose money\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

As the market goes up they raise their stop price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was wondering how this would work if the market is closed, or if the circuit breakers kick in, and when the market re-opens the prices are all well below their limit/stop price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, lets say the Dow closes at 36,000 and some terrible news event occurs overnight there might be no way people would be able to exit their positions at 36,000. They wlll have to sell after the market opens right? And the market wil open much lower than 36,000.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if word gets out that certain investors were able to sell, while retail investors were unable to get their orders filled this could lead to a full scale revolt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this concern legitimate, or are their controls in place to prevent retail investors from getting hosed while the well connected all exit their long positions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-just-called-technology-140000074.html&quot;&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-just-called-technology-140000074.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting use of terminology.  “Market cap” is the market value of a publicly-traded company&amp;#39;s outstanding shares.  Therefore, I’m to take it that AI is an opportunity for a single company to be worth 80T. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphabet is one of the leaders in the AI space; at an almost $2T market cap, they would need to grow 45% YoY over the next 10 years to hit 80T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost any other company in the world would need significantly more growth to get to $80T. No one would have thought APPL would be a $2.5T company 10 years ago when they were $335b, but to get there was a 20% YoY growth from 2011 -&amp;gt; 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is she pulling this info from? How can she justify these claims?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity’s data show hundreds of thousands of people with million-dollar retirement accounts, and I say hurray for them. Their golden years are looking good.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, the number of accounts with $1 million or more grew 74.5%, but it’s not clear how many individuals this represents, since investors can have multiple accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How it started:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per this tweet he announced to sell 10% of his stocks, which was at the time of his tweet: 172,6m ordinary shares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started on monday 8th november and started selling. We know exactly how much he sells each day since he needs to file those numbers to the SEC. You can find them here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings&quot;&gt;click&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the proof he is really selling as announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may check this article to see its legit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389&quot;&gt;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How it is going:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this graphic on Twitter which visualizes his sales in relation to the performance of the Tesla share price: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RawBooty2/status/1459121681549733893&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that Elons sales continously move the price downwards. Please note that the graphic wasnt updated for fridays sales yet. I will update it as soon as its available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Now the interesting part We know how many shares he still has to sell !&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 17,3m shares (10% of 172,6m) minus what has been sold already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So that is 11,4m shares left for sale&lt;/strong&gt; since we know from SEC files he sold 4,9m shares until friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I copied all the SEC files in one Excel document and calculated the sales volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we assume he will continue to sell 500 - 639k shares a day as he did the last three days that means &lt;strong&gt;he will be selling for another 18-23 trading days&lt;/strong&gt;. Which would be 8th dec - 15th dec&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we use this knowledge ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I assume and the chart proves it that the buyers will not be willing to jump in front of the bus while Elon dumps his shares. So there is a really good chance we see lower prices until he is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately i cant include pictures in this post. I will give you guys a link to a post with pictures in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a rise in SP on Wednesday but he filed his first SEC report on Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ever since it is public knowledge that he &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; started selling and how much he sells it was going down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How to play it:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see several possibilities to take profit from this knowledge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold puts until Elon is almost done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell a part of holding now and buy it back later at lower prices (some say thats what EMusk might intend to do)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold puts until Elon is done and reinvest your gains in calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the daily patterns, caused by Elons broker dumping shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, i cant post pictures here. I will include the link to the pictured post in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might notice that each day from Wednesday to Friday starts with a dip and then a mini rally which peaks between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM. Followed by descending prices through the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently i am holding puts which i bought last monday and wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no financial advisor and please dont regard this as any form of advice or recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do your own due dilligence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, trying to figure out what stocks could potentially blow up are fun as well, but I’ve grown to feel that’s just a bit unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I have about $950 invested in individual stocks on Robinhood and another $720 on Acorns. I currently own shares in APPL, ACB, RKT, CNK, and BLV. None of these 5 have done as much as I would have expected them to at this point in the year but it’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, hope this question makes sense, just want to learn how to make quality investments. What kind of research I need to do beforehand would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole thing about Elon trying to cash out some stock to pay taxes as a nice guy, was an obvious BS excuse. Then the media comes out saying his REAL intention is to pay taxes that are due. Brilliant, double play to cover for his personal cash out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Elon had faith that his stock still had room to grow, there is no chance in hell he&amp;#39;d be selling. He&amp;#39;d just be getting a loan to cover his tax liabilities, while his equity value increases. The fact that he&amp;#39;s trying to cash out shows he thinks it&amp;#39;s near peak and about to go down. All the media drama is just an attempt to retain value for as long as possible to distract and justify his cash out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s crazy how I see NO ONE talking about this... And instead it&amp;#39;s all about &amp;quot;clever redditors&amp;quot; seeing his real intentions are to cover his tax liability. No it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

For transparency, I have not yet fully disinvested from China (I&amp;#39;m only 22 and my funds at risk are minimal), but going forward it is something I&amp;#39;m increasingly aware of. Would recommend an hour of your time to listen. Even if you aren&amp;#39;t as bearish on China, it still is a thoughtful and honest approach to analyzing under the radar risks from an investor profiled in the Big Short for foreseeing the housing  crisis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) Some combination of the above?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t quite understand the argument for (a) because I doubt most investors decide to drop VTI or MSFT and buy and hold TLT for 18 years or whatever it&amp;#39;s average duration is, so it must only be a short term play (are they really expecting the down-turn to last the duration of TLT?), but why would it be safer than just holding cash or short/ultra-short bonds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if they really thought the currency was going to collapse, why not switch to another currency rather than locking into the USD with bonds that will get killed by inflation as the dollar collapses, so I don&amp;#39;t see how they are a flight to safety there either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a reflex, IPS/corporate investment rules-based, is it not wanting to keep large amounts of cash in bank accounts, or is it some combination of (b) and (c), i.e. a profit motive?&lt;/p&gt;
