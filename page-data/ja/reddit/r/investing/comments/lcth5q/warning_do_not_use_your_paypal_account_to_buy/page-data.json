Here&#39;s a quick example and a best case scenario too.  You use your PP account to buy $5000 worth of coin, their fee is a &quot;modest&quot; 1.5% for that (fees are higher below $1000) So you paid $75 right out of the gate, now let&#39;s say it has (a very unlikely) run and wow you doubled your money. You cash out at $10k, now PP takes another $150 (1.5%) to sell your coin. So your actual profits are $5000 and your PP fees are $250, boom they zinged you for <strong>5% of your total profits.</strong> And that&#39;s all best case scenario.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcth5q/warning_do_not_use_your_paypal_account_to_buy/","title":"Warning: Do not use your Paypal account to buy Crypto unless you like giving your hard to come by profits away.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T03:19:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 03:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ef957c86-0de0-5ffa-a9a1-b145c7405839","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcth5q/warning_do_not_use_your_paypal_account_to_buy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lcth5q/warning_do_not_use_your_paypal_account_to_buy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"the_last_carfighter","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_last_carfighter","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"the_last_carfighter","score":176,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"警告：请不要使用你的Paypal账户购买Crypto。不要用你的Paypal账户去买Crypto 除非你喜欢把你那来之不易的利润拱手相让.","the_new_excerpt":"我想；\"它在那里，它很容易，我不想等待几天的钱。\n以最终落在另一个账户上。\" 他们的费用，表面上看并不\n似乎很可怕，直到你做数学。这里有一个快速的例子和一个最好的案例。\n的场景了。你用PP账户买了价值5000元的币，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"警告：請不要使用你的Paypal賬戶購買Crypto。不要用你的Paypal賬戶去買Crypto 除非你喜歡把你那來之不易的利潤拱手相讓.","the_new_excerpt":"我想；\"它在那裏，它很容易，我不想等待幾天的錢。\n以最終落在另一個賬戶上。\" 他們的費用，表面上看並不\n似乎很可怕，直到你做數學。這裏有一個快速的例子和一個最好的案例。\n的場景了。你用PP賬戶買了價值5000元的幣，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b5ffed6d-42f8-50ae-bc2b-35196a268126","excerpt":"Hey all!
