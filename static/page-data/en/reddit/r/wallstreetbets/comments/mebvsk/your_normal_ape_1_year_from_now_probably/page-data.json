I feel that most of the people investing in GME and AMC are normal down-to-earth people( i mean apes) and would not like to have the showoff kind of status but would like to make some dreams came true and have somehow a comfortable life. You would see them in some Mazdas, Honda&#39;s, Fords, Teslas model 3, etc. But the thing is that they would have the premium version with the best engine and all.</li>\n<li>He is debt-free, he won&#39;t talk about it but you won&#39;t hear him complaining about any student loans, car payments he has to do or anything.</li>\n<li>He does not work at that place you knew he was working before. So what&#39;s he doing? &quot;Wait, you quit your job? But it was a stable one and it&#39;s getting even harder to find jobs right now&quot;. &quot; Yeah, I took up *- insert interesting hobby/dream job/artistic activity/starting a business-*, I kind of felt it was the right direction for me, I m doing well right now, I don&#39;t think I will give it up to soon&quot;.</li>\n<li>He&#39;s in college, maybe, or taking some classes to do a career reconversion. Who knew she/he had an attraction for that domain right?</li>\n<li>He spends way more time with family. It&#39;s like he&#39;s always having time to spend with his girlfriend/kids/parents/friend. But he was working 50 hours a week. How does he have time to go on vacations every other week or so, taking kids to the park and all of that? Is he working from home and got a new position at the firm?</li>\n<li>He&#39;s not so active on social media. He&#39;s doing all sorts of things but does not fiend the need to get approval from others by posting share locations or pictures from where he&#39;s going or what he&#39;s doing. Only once in a while, you get a picture with him in a nice place but that&#39;s it.</li>\n<li>Way healthier. &quot;Hey did you start going to the gym? Yeah, had taken swimming and hiking also, I feel very good since then&quot;.</li>\n<li>Stopped drinking/smoking so much or being in a kind of bad mood most of the time. He does not have to do 3 night shifts per week anymore, right?</li>\n<li>Have a nice feeling all around. These people(apes) would start doing charity more, even the ones with more effort, like planting trees, going to the local homeless shelter(which also got build in the last 6 mounts) to help with cooking food for the people in need, helping with cleaning the garbage thrown away by people who last name is also garbage.</li>\n<li>Last of all, you kind of heard that more than 6 or 9 months ago he had a wild 2 weeks, like traveling half the country, doing some weird things, spending a lot of money, driving some luxury cars, but it&#39;s just some rumors, you don&#39;t know for sure. Also, why does he always wear those Monkey&#39;s Business t-shirts all the time, hmm?</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mebvsk/your_normal_ape_1_year_from_now_probably/","title":"Your normal ape 1 year from now... probably","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-27T16:00:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-27 16:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"970202d8-95bb-5679-960c-7a2d586b624f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mebvsk/your_normal_ape_1_year_from_now_probably/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mebvsk/your_normal_ape_1_year_from_now_probably/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"nicolaespan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nicolaespan","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"nicolaespan","score":1653,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"一年后，你的正常猿人... ...可能是。","the_new_excerpt":" 1.  他开的是顶级的 \"普通车\"。我觉得大部分投资的人\n     在GME和AMC中，他们都是正常的平凡人（我指的是猿人），不会有这样的想法。\n     喜欢有炫耀的状态，但想做一些梦想。\n     梦想成真，过上了舒适的生活。你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一年後，你的正常猿人... ...可能是。","the_new_excerpt":" 1.  他開的是頂級的 \"普通車\"。我覺得大部分投資的人\n     在GME和AMC中，他們都是正常的平凡人（我指的是猿人），不會有這樣的想法。\n     喜歡有炫耀的狀態，但想做一些夢想。\n     夢想成真，過上了舒適的生活。你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1375787812243578884","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1375787812243578884","title":"% of Population Vaccinated w/ 1+ Doses of Covid-19 Vaccine...\nIsrael: 58%\nUK: 44%\nChile: 33%\nUS: 27%\nSerbia: 20%\nFinland: 15%\nSingapore: 14%\nMorocco: 12%\nFrance: 11%\nCanada: 11%\nItaly: 10%\nGermany: 10%\nSpain: 10%\nBrazil: 7%\nArgentina: 6%\nRussia: 4%\nMexico: 4%\nIndia: 4%\nJapan: 1%","date":"March 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"接种1剂以上Covid-19疫苗的人口百分比......\n以色列：58%。58%\n联合王国：44%\n智利： 33%\n美国：27%\n塞尔维亚：20%\n芬兰：15%\n新加坡：14%\n摩洛哥：12%\n法国：11%\n加拿大：11% 11%\n意大利：10%\n德国：10%\n西班牙：10%\n巴西：7%\n阿根廷：6%\n俄罗斯：4%\n墨西哥： 4%\n印度： 4%\n日本：1%","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"接種1劑以上Covid-19疫苗的人口百分比......\n以色列：58%。58%\n聯合王國：44%\n智利： 33%\n美國：27%\n塞爾維亞：20%\n芬蘭：15%\n新加坡：14%\n摩洛哥：12%\n法國：11%\n加拿大：11% 11%\n意大利：10%\n德國：10%\n西班牙：10%\n巴西：7%\n阿根廷：6%\n俄羅斯：4%\n墨西哥： 4%\n印度： 4%\n日本：1%","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-03b6d98b-2d3e-52d3-a4bc-e90e5597020a","excerpt":"If your question is \"I have $10,000, what do I do?\" or other \"advice for my\npersonal situation\" questions, you should include relevant information, such as\nthe following:\n\n * How old are you?
