&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B.1.1.529, to be named Nu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 mutations in spike protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earliest known case: South Africa, Nov. 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fears it could be more transmissible, evade immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK &amp;amp; Israel impose travel bans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SA reports 2,465 new cases, up 321% from last week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According here &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drericding/status/1463998740340121601?s=21&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/drericding/status/1463998740340121601?s=21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost double the mutations as delta&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was vaccine resistant as people tested were double vaccinated with Pfizer (but did not have 3rd booster) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHO already emergency meeting and UK and Israel have shut down flights coming from 6 nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest issue is that the new variant is VACCINE RESISTANT which seems awful long term unless people are really going to attempt to get us to take brand new vaccine shots in 3-4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t contribute enough to my Roth this year and want to reach the $6000 maximum.

This money would not be in surplus to what I deposited into my brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS website just says that the money used to fund it has to be earned wages, but doesn’t go into further depth. Is it still “earned” if I’m just withdrawing money that I had earned and churned through some day trades? Am I over thinking this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s tech watchdog wants management to take the company off the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesday’s close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didi’s biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliberations continue and it’s possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijing’s municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company’s U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies Inc. are Didi’s biggest minority shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the world’s largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms’ books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinping’s administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or “common prosperity,” has targeted an internet sector that’s accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didi’s stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the country’s internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in China’s largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi’s IPO decision as a challenge to the central government’s authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi’s offices in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that’s traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.&lt;/p&gt;

In general for you own portion of capital in a sector you will defer to the opinion of the &amp;#39;specialist&amp;#39; on where to invest it, and they to you for whatever you specialize in. There are also friends who follow along with us but do not have the time to research anything and so do not provide insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got us thinking, wouldn&amp;#39;t it be convenient to just pool our money in a club and let everyone handle their specialty independently but the effects would be felt collectively. John handles all the healthcare investments, Brian the banking, Steve the tech, etc. From what I have read on investment clubs its pretty clear that those who would actually manage investments can all form a club together and we wouldn&amp;#39;t need any sort of licensing. The question comes in with the silent members who do not research or invest themselves. If we had 4 people making the decisions and 6 whose money was in the partnership but they made no input, would this mean the 4 &amp;#39;managers&amp;#39; need licensing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we were to divide the partnership in a way that the active members received more through ownership means, would this break the rules for an investment club? Ex: Brain and Steve form an investment club and both contribute $50,000. Brain manages and makes all investment decisions so he gets a 60% interest in the LLC while Steve gets 40%. From my own understanding and research it seems this should be allowed under &amp;#39;sweat equity&amp;#39; rules but I know investing is subject to special stipulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I am aware of the old &amp;#39;never invest your friends money&amp;#39; saying but we are all adults&amp;#39; with experience and this represents a tiny fraction of each of our net worth&amp;#39;s. Appreciate any input!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Mallouk&amp;#39;s book &amp;quot;The Five Mistakes Every Investor Makes&amp;quot; examines how different sectors performed during that period. To wit, between 2000 and 2010, the following sectors performed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-Cap US: 0.00%*
Mid-Cap US: +64.73%
Small-Cap US: +78.76%
International: +134.39%
Emerging Markets: +437.36%
Real Estate: +228.19%
Bonds: +175.73%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach for total market, world market, emerging markets, is what I see. Not sure which exact bonds and real estate markets are included in Mallouk&amp;#39;s analysis, but bonds in general are useful portfolio ballast, and real estate is included in diversified indexes by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund is an actively managed exchange traded fund that attempts to achieve the inverse (-1x) of the return of the ETF for a single day, not for any other period, by entering into a swap agreement on the ETF. The ARK Innovation ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies that are relevant to the fund&amp;#39;s investment theme of disruptive innovation. It is non-diversified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a tough year to be a Cathie Wood  ARKK investor. It has been slowly but steadily losing ground throughout much of 2021, with ARK Innovation falling about 15% year to date.&lt;/p&gt;

I manage to average down to $200 but it&amp;#39;s still far away from the current price of $136~, I want to continue to average down since I think it&amp;#39;s still very attractive valuation for the risk vs reward but it&amp;#39;s already my biggest holding and makes up 21-24% of my portfolio alone, adding in JD, my China risk is already at 30-33% of my entire portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand I want to continue to average down because I think it&amp;#39;s a bargain and it&amp;#39;s a big difference from my cost basis but on the other hand, it&amp;#39;s already a very substantial position in my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry is set to have a parabolic run over the next few weeks/months with many upcoming catalysts! Below is my analysis of why I think the stock is going higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying BlackBerry now is similar to buying $AMD at $2.00 in 2014 when SU BAE stepped in as CEO and took the stock to the moon! I believe this is a very similar opportunity right now! 🤫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My fellow APES&lt;/strong&gt; 🐵 &lt;strong&gt;just remember that DIAMONDS&lt;/strong&gt; 💎 &lt;strong&gt;are made under PRESSURE&lt;/strong&gt; 🖐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck and let&amp;#39;s hope that PAPA CHEN makes it rain TENDIES!  🐔 💦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background - The turn around story of the SLEEPING GIANT&lt;/strong&gt;  💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of CEO John Chen, BlackBerry has spent the past 8 years pivoting from hardware smartphones to the future: (1) IoT Internet of Things (2) Automotive/EV and (3) Cyber Security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of these areas are growth opportunities and BlackBerry has strategically partnered with many large tech companies including: Amazon, Microsoft and Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market value of &lt;strong&gt;BlackBerry is CRIMINALLY UNDERVALUED&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;at ~$6 Billion&lt;/strong&gt; compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $53 Billion, $PANW at $54 Billion and $ZS at $48 Billion to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transformation of the business can be summarized in the slide below. Mickensy Consulting has estimated that the pool of reoccurring revenue from the IoT and connected car will grow exponentially over the next 10 years, which is VERY GOOD for BlackBerry&amp;#39;s new business model!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patent Sale/Settlement/Partnership Announcement&lt;/strong&gt;  💰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is been lots of speculation and rumors over the past few month from various sources, ranging from Facebook $FB being the sole purchaser for cash up front and/or a partnership deal, to a group of parties. The range of the deal is said to be worth $1 Billion to $2 Billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last conference call, CEO John Chen said that there is about an &amp;quot;80% probability that the deal closes by Q4&amp;quot;. This date is November 2021, which is next week. However, they could also be waiting to release it during their next earnings call on December 21st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QNX, IoT (Internet of Things), Amazon IVY and the connected car ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;  👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QNX real-time OS is installed in 195M cars today, out of 1.4B cars in total on the road worldwide. QNX enables many different software pieces to run in a car, so acts as a kind of central control unit. QNX is becoming the predominant OS for connected cars, since it´s installed in so many cars. Whilst today $BB licenses QNX to OEMs on a per-unit royalty basis, QNX is effectively set up (through Blackberry Ivy, in partnership with $AMZN) to be the foundation of the data value chain for the auto industry, which McKinsey estimates will be quite big, specially for a company ($BB) with a market cap of $6 Billion today. I think this will extend to other verticals over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the North American and Japanese automakers, BlackBerry QNX also have partnerships with Chinese EV&amp;#39;s such as $XPEV and $BIDU (who plans to make EV&amp;#39;s in the future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CES 2022 BB will be demonstrating both cyber and IoT with key partners&lt;/strong&gt;  👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry has started testing their BETA version of IVY with Amazon this fall and are looking to showcase more features and capabilities with key partners at the CES in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mou8wkvvem181.png?width=970&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=19e8d506ece446890b7c2d1cc4c71ceb2eb9116d&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mou8wkvvem181.png?width=970&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=19e8d506ece446890b7c2d1cc4c71ceb2eb9116d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the last conference call, BlackBerry announced that they hired John Giamatteo from McAfee to lead BlackBerry&amp;#39;s cyber security business unit&lt;/strong&gt;  👌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John&amp;#39;s executive experience and connections should be BlackBerry generate sales in their current vertices and new market opportunities down the road, for both enterprise and consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BlackBerry continues to win Awards and is issued/granted new patents every month&lt;/strong&gt;  😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, SE Labs  independently-owned and run testing company that assesses security products and services ranked BlackBerry as #1 in New Endpoint system security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quote: ”2021 has been the first year we have tested this product with BlackBerry publicly. When judging for our annual awards it is hard to ignore when a new, significant vendor enters our tests and performs so well from the start,&amp;quot; said Simon Edwards, CEO SE Labs. Blackberry has demonstrated excellent performance in our &amp;#39;real-world&amp;#39; testing, and the product is well regarded by both our expert panel of judges and users of the product. We would like to congratulate BlackBerry on achieving the award for best new endpoint.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional Funds are loading up BIGLY&lt;/strong&gt;  👀 🔍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past months, big institutions have been increasing their position. Today for example, Morgan Stanley&amp;#39;s 13F filing showed that they alone increased their $BB holdings by +51%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they have insider info about the patent sale and/or other news? Could a Price Target increase be coming soon now that they  have loaded up on shares?&lt;/p&gt;

There is no employer match. I looked at the plan&amp;#39;s offerings and saw it had Vanguard target index funds with a fee of only .13%. I was excited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my dad had a meeting with the rep to sign up and it turns out his 457 plan adds a fee of .45% and another fee of .65% on top of .13% charged by Vanguard. So the total cost to invest in this Vanguard index fund is 1.23%, whereas you can invest directly with Vanguard for only .13%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the rep actually allocated 90% of the portfolio to an actively managed T Rowe Price target date fund with a final fee of 1.51% because the rep said the T Rowe Price fund had a better performance history than Vanguard. The final 10% the rep allocated to an actively managed REIT with a final fee of 1.98%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel horrible for my dad. Is he getting screwed or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the fees are so high it is my understanding it&amp;#39;s still better for my dad to do this because  of tax advantages. Of course I explained to my dad he should be maxing out his self directed IRA first and then contribute to the 457 plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention the rep for the 457 plan said the average mutual fund cost in the U.S. is 1.5%. Is this actually true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Total gain was $1907.38

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the average # of buy recommendations ~$11,500 of capital needed per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~16.59% total gain -&lt;/strong&gt; not bad but below S&amp;amp;500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy #2: buy next day (after the show), hold 5 days and sell EOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total gain was $27,720.31

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the average # of buy recommendations ~$57,500 of capital needed per day&lt;/li&gt;

Wealthfront has me invested in dividends stocks (SCHD) at some nominal percentage (maybe 10% of portfolio) for a taxable account. I had read a post the other day where someone had commented, “why are you investing in dividend ETFs, are you retired?” Is this a consideration? Should I not be in dividend yielding ETFs unless I’m in retirement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: only about 20% of my portfolio is in WF and I manage everything else myself. I just get $40k managed free there and they do tax loss harvesting well. So I’m really wondering if I should be more in on dividend ETFs in my other taxable accounts or prioritizing more toward like VTI (which I’m heavily in as well). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: are higher dividend yielding ETFs like SCHD worth holding for a younger investor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If cannabis is legalized for recreational use, the country - which has a population of more than 83million - could become the biggest cannabis market in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;180-page document lays out coalition&amp;#39;s legislative priorities for next four years&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contained within it is a pledge to legalize cannabis to be sold in licensed shops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10238617/Germany-legalise-CANNABIS-countrys-new-coalition-leaders-announce.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10238617/Germany-legalise-CANNABIS-countrys-new-coalition-leaders-announce.html&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you thoughts on North American companies with cannabis trade to Germany already in place for medical marijuana, like TLRY? Are they going to up the demand a little more as they legalize, or potentially block them out in favor of German-owned growhouses?&lt;/p&gt;
