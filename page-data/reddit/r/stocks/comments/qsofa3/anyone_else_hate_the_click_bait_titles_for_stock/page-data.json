Like the people who write these articles, I don&#39;t know how they get paid for this. These analysts are paid to type nonsense every single day, but they aren&#39;t paid to be accurate.</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if there was some enforced rules to these fancy adjectives. Because i see it with every company. They say plummet, or downward spiral, or falling when a company goes down even 1%, but jettisoned, surged, or sky rocket when it&#39;s doing mildly good. I think it&#39;s meant to keep people nervous and excited so people keep buying and selling and eventually make no money in the end.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qsofa3/anyone_else_hate_the_click_bait_titles_for_stock/","title":"Anyone else hate the click bait titles for stock analysis articles?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-13T06:38:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-13 06:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qsofa3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qsofa3/anyone_else_hate_the_click_bait_titles_for_stock/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qsofa3/anyone_else_hate_the_click_bait_titles_for_stock/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Foamy-Bot","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Foamy-Bot","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Foamy-Bot","score":136,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"株式分析記事のクリックベイト的なタイトルが嫌いな人はいませんか？","the_new_excerpt":"M1ファイナンスを使って、ランダムな銘柄のテロップを見て回っていたのですが\n私が気になったのは、彼らが使っている劇的な言葉の数々です。\n株が上がったとか下がったとか、ドラマチックな言い方をするんですよね。\n\n株が1ドルでも5％でも上がったら、「この株は今日急上昇しました。\nこの株は今日、急上昇しました」とか...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"还有人讨厌股票分析文章的点击率标题吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我正在使用M1金融系统来寻找随机的股票代码，然后我注意到了一件事。\n我注意到有件事让我很不爽，那就是他们在说股票上涨或下跌时使用的整个戏剧性语言。\n他们用整个戏剧性的语言来说明一只股票的涨跌。\n\n如果一只股票上涨了一美元或5%左右，他们就会说一些愚蠢的废话，如：\"这只股票今天大涨。\n这只股票今天大涨。\"或者...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"還有人討厭股票分析文章的點擊率標題嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我正在使用M1金融系統來尋找隨機的股票代碼，然後我注意到了一件事。\n我注意到有件事讓我很不爽，那就是他們在說股票上漲或下跌時使用的整個戲劇性語言。\n他們用整個戲劇性的語言來說明一隻股票的漲跌。\n\n如果一隻股票上漲了一美元或5%左右，他們就會說一些愚蠢的廢話，如：\"這隻股票今天大漲。\n這隻股票今天大漲。\"或者...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qsrov3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qsrov3/poking_holes_in_the_inflation_conspiracy_theory/","title":"Poking holes in the inflation conspiracy theory, by Larry Swedroe","date":"November 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"インフレ陰謀論に穴を開ける by Larry Swedroe","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"戳穿通货膨胀阴谋论的漏洞，作者：Larry Swedroe","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"戳穿通貨膨脹陰謀論的漏洞，作者：Larry Swedroe","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qssi74","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qssi74/from_400_to_51k_in_just_over_a_month/","title":"From $400 to $51k in just over a month","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 13, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"わずか1ヶ月で400ドルから51kドルへ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"在短短一个多月内从400美元到51000美元","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在短短一個多月內從400美元到51000美元","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qsofa3","previousId":"RedditPost-qsrov3","nextId":"RedditPost-qssi74","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qsofa3/anyone_else_hate_the_click_bait_titles_for_stock/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
