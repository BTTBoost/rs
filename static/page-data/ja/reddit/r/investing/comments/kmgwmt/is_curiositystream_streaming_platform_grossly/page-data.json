Looking for a pure play in the streaming service I came across CuriosityStream. Basically the platform offers documentaries about science, history, politics, etc...  and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform. The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former chairman of Discovery.</p>\n\n<p>After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3 was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber base comes from bundled packages at a heavy discount. They are looking for exposure while growing at all costs. Here are some key point:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The company has no debt and $180M cash in the balance sheet.</li>\n<li><strong>The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions  in Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020</strong></li>\n<li>Over 60% gross margin</li>\n<li>They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in revenues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Giving the uncertainty of the current market environment it seems pretty safe to buy something that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting an industry, targeting a more sophisticated  costumers instead of the average becky who likes stranger things. The last time John Hendricks created something (Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a $32B company before stepping down and creating CuriosityStream.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to hear your thoughts on the comment section and discuss if in fact CuriosityStream is already fairly valued, undervalued or maybe overvalued.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Side note:</em></strong> John Hendricks has been buying shares this month increasing his position by 21%.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kmgwmt/is_curiositystream_streaming_platform_grossly/","title":"Is CuriosityStream (streaming platform) grossly undervalued at $550M with already 13M paying subscribers?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 29, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-29T19:48:30.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-29 19:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a62478df-d5ac-5a1f-992b-a136cedff9af","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kmgwmt/is_curiositystream_streaming_platform_grossly/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kmgwmt/is_curiositystream_streaming_platform_grossly/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"bearsgotoalaskanstfu","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bearsgotoalaskanstfu","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"bearsgotoalaskanstfu","score":395,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"已经有1300万付费订户的CuriosityStream(流媒体平台)价值5.5亿美元，是不是被严重低估了？","the_new_excerpt":"流媒体行业最近通过所有的新闻获得了大量的曝光率\n来自迪士尼+和HBO MAX。在流媒体服务中寻找纯粹的机会\n偶然发现了好奇心溪流。基本上，该平台提供关于以下内容的纪录片\n科学、历史、政治等。他们有3,000多种图书…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"已經有1300萬付費訂戶的CuriosityStream(流媒體平臺)價值5.5億美元，是不是被嚴重低估了？","the_new_excerpt":"流媒體行業最近通過所有的新聞獲得了大量的曝光率\n來自迪士尼+和HBO MAX。在流媒體服務中尋找純粹的機會\n偶然發現了好奇心溪流。基本上，該平臺提供關於以下內容的紀錄片\n科學、歷史、政治等。他們有3,000多種圖書…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-089f13a3-822a-556b-962d-eaf71054bf07","excerpt":"https://in.reuters.com/article/us-yahua-group-electric-tesla-lithium/chinas-yahua-agrees-five-year-deal-to-supply-lithium-to-tesla-idUSKBN293132\n\nTesla, which started delivering the first vehicles from its gigafactory in\nShanghai in December last year, already sources lithium - an ingredient in…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kmgnqr/chinas_yahua_agrees_fiveyear_deal_to_supply/","title":"China's Yahua agrees five-year deal to supply lithium to Tesla","date":"December 29, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"中国雅华同意向特斯拉供应锂的五年协议","the_new_excerpt":"https://in.reuters.com/article/us-yahua-group-electric-tesla-lithium/chinas-yahua-agrees-five-year-deal-to-supply-lithium-to-tesla-idUSKBN293132\n\n年，特斯拉开始从其巨型工厂交付第一批汽车\n去年12月在上海，已经开始采购锂-…的一种成分","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中國雅華同意向特斯拉供應鋰的五年協議","the_new_excerpt":"https://in.reuters.com/article/us-yahua-group-electric-tesla-lithium/chinas-yahua-agrees-five-year-deal-to-supply-lithium-to-tesla-idUSKBN293132\n\n年，特斯拉開始從其巨型工廠交付第一批汽車\n去年12月在上海，已經開始採購鋰-…的一種成分","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-43daeae8-1c93-5bdb-95de-8be339de270b","excerpt":"I feel like even with good things happening such as the stimulus and a potential\nraise in the stimulus amount, just because it’s Dec. 29th the last day you can\nsell for a tax loss that it should be expected to be a big red day.
