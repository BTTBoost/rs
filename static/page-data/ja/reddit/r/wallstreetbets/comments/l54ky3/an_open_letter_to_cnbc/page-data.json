Then they have the nerve to turn us into public enemy #1 just because we believe in an underdog company getting a second chance. </p>\n\n<p>We don’t have billionaires to bail us out when we mess up our portfolio risk and a position goes against us. We can’t go on TV and make attempts to manipulate millions to take our side of the trade. If we mess up as bad as they did, we’re wiped out, have to start from scratch and are back to giving handjobs behind the dumpster at Wendy’s. </p>\n\n<p>Seriously. Motherfuck these people.
