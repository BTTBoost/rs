We want to invest $750k of it. The rest of the settlement will be used for having money on hand, and for improvements on our home, and maybe a vacation after the pandemic calms down.</p>\n\n<p>Just some quick info about our situation.</p>\n\n<p>She(52) has been declared disabled by the government and collects $1600 in SS and has Medicare. I(39) make around 40k a year, it varies, but has never been less than 35k, or more than 55k. We have one child(14) still living with us. We do not have much savings, a little under $10k in the bank. No 401k, IRA, etc. We only recently were able to start saving money, once my wife got early SS, and has Medicare now.</p>\n\n<p>We have no debt outside of one car payment, and a mortgage. We are 8 years into our 3.5% mortgage($143k), it is 1000k a month. We have around 300-350k in equity in the house, we bought at the literal bottom in a beautiful area just outside a large city that is becoming more desired. The car payment is $640 a month, with around $13k left on it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m content with our current lifestyle. We&#39;d like to do more vacations mostly.</p>\n\n<p>My wife wants to get a financial planner, and her cousin thinks it&#39;s a good idea. Her cousin is a bank president, so she is definitely someone worth listening to on these issues I think. She&#39;s also the only person we&#39;ve trusted to tell this to, she doesn&#39;t know the amount though(it&#39;s not worth the risk of us losing the settlement, I&#39;ll be deleting this throwaway quickly as well). However, I really don&#39;t think our amount of money is large enough to warrant a financial planner.</p>\n\n<p>My wife also thinks paying off our house would be good. I think that our interest rate is quite low, and we can probably put that $140K to better use earning more than 3.5%. The piece of mind of no mortgage is very powerful though I have to admit. I&#39;d love advice on that idea.</p>\n\n<p>I have no desire to try and beat the market or do the necessary DD to even attempt it. Capitalism requires growth in the long term, or it dies. I will just go with that iron law and profit alongside it, index funds capture that reality perfectly it seems. We don&#39;t want to touch the money until our son graduates in 4 years, and then we only want to pull out a little bit. Maybe 3-4% a year to supplement our lifestyle. We&#39;d like to leave our children with money when we die(which hopefully is way out in the future)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to retire early as well, but I&#39;m not sure when that would be feasible. My wife and I are totally fine with pretending this money is just money we wisely saved over the last 20 years, and letting interest do what interest does going forward.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably best to just do a lazy two funds portfolio, with something like VT, and BNDW at a 70-30 split respectively. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love any input/advice you all have.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p7vjoh/windfall750k_how_to_invest_it/","title":"Windfall(750k) How to invest it?","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-20T09:44:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-20 09:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"25c528da-4713-50bc-8ce1-1831f99b8d8c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p7vjoh/windfall750k_how_to_invest_it/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p7vjoh/windfall750k_how_to_invest_it/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"Responsible-Talk-","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Responsible-Talk-","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Responsible-Talk-","score":75,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Windfall(750k) どうやって投資する？","the_new_excerpt":"こんにちは。\n\n先日、妻が多額の現金決済を受けました。そのうち75万ドルを投資したいと考えています。残りの和解金は\n残りの和解金は、手元にお金を置いておくために使います。\nまた、パンデミックが落ち着いたら、休暇を取ることも考えています。\n\n私たちの状況について簡単に説明します。\n\n彼女（52歳）はずっと...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"暴利（75万）如何投资？","the_new_excerpt":"你好。\n\n我的妻子最近得到了一大笔现金结算。我们想投资其中的75万美元。我们想投资其中的75万美元。\n其余的和解金将用于手头的资金，以及用于\n改善我们的房子，也许在大流行病平静下来后还可以去度假。\n\n只是一些关于我们情况的快速信息。\n\n她（52岁）一直...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"暴利（75萬）如何投資？","the_new_excerpt":"你好。\n\n我的妻子最近得到了一大筆現金結算。我們想投資其中的75萬美元。我們想投資其中的75萬美元。\n其餘的和解金將用於手頭的資金，以及用於\n改善我們的房子，也許在大流行病平靜下來後還可以去度假。\n\n只是一些關於我們情況的快速信息。\n\n她（52歲）一直...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9c4b9fa2-ead1-5640-99e6-e412188c48c3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p7nvbj/this_subreddit_in_a_nutshell/","title":"This subreddit in a nutshell","date":"August 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"このsubredditを一言で言うと","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"这个分论坛的简述","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"這個分論壇的簡述","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1428434355366600707","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1428434355366600707","title":"Me two years ago: \n\n\"I can't believe I'm going to pay off my mortgage in 13 years.
