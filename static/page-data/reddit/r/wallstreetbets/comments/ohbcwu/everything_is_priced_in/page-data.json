That&#39;s already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D&#39;s and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don&#39;t already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil&#39;s expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren&#39;t thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don&#39;t ask such a dumb fucking question again.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ohbcwu/everything_is_priced_in/","title":"Everything is priced in","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-10T09:36:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-10 09:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e971fd81-a030-5daa-95d9-66fb9ad43d7a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ohbcwu/everything_is_priced_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ohbcwu/everything_is_priced_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"supremefrenchprince","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/supremefrenchprince","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"supremefrenchprince","score":4554,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"で全てが価格設定されています。","the_new_excerpt":"質問しても無駄だ。答えはイエスで、値段がついています。アマゾンは\nが次の決算を上回ると思いますか？それはすでに織り込み済みです。あなたはMickey D'sのドライブスルーで働いています。\nMickey D'sのドライブスルーで働いていて、ハンバーガーが人間の肉で作られていることを知った？\n織り込み済みです。インサイダーがそれを知らないとでも？市場は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"所有东西的价格都是以","the_new_excerpt":"甚至不要问这个问题。答案是肯定的，它是有价的。你认为亚马逊\n会战胜下一次收益吗？这已经被定价了。你在\n你在Mickey D's餐厅工作，发现汉堡是用人肉做的？\n已经定价了。你以为内部人士不知道吗？市场...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"所有東西的價格都是以","the_new_excerpt":"甚至不要問這個問題。答案是肯定的，它是有價的。你認爲亞馬遜\n會戰勝下一次收益嗎？這已經被定價了。你在\n你在Mickey D's餐廳工作，發現漢堡是用人肉做的？\n已經定價了。你以爲內部人士不知道嗎？市場...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3a50f446-dad6-5fac-8756-5080454d1f26","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh9zt5/10125_daily_loss/","title":"-101.25% daily loss","date":"July 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"-101.25%日損","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"-101.25%的日损失","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"-101.25%的日損失","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-91cafc05-db4c-52f4-9a07-784878520f8b","excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/chinese-antitrust-regulator-blocks-tencents-video-games-merger/ar-AALYO4O\n\nThe Chinese regulators seems to be serious with their crack down on the tech\nindustry.
