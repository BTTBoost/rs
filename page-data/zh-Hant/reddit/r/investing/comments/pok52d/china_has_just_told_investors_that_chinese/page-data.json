GROUP TO &#39;CC&#39; FROM &#39;CCC+&#39; ON 7 SEPT, INDICATING THAT WE VIEW A DEFAULT OF SOME KIND AS PROBABLE</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More context:</p>\n\n<p><a

agency Fitch said that numerous sectors could be exposed to heightened credit risk if China&#39;s No.2 property developer Evergrande Group (3333.HK) were to default, although the overall impact on the banking sector would be manageable.</p>\n\n<p>Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing. read more</p>\n\n<p>Regulators have warned of broader risks to the country&#39;s financial system if the company&#39;s $305 billion of liabilities aren&#39;t contained.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,&quot; Fitch said in a note late on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Fitch downgraded China Evergrande Group to &quot;CC&quot; from &quot;CCC+&quot; on Sep. 7, indicating that it viewed a default of some kind as probable.</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, Evergrande said it has engaged advisers to examine its financial options and warned of cross-default risks amid plunging property sales and lack of progress in asset disposals. read more</p>\n\n<p>Fitch said 572 billion yuan ($88.8 billion) of Evergrande&#39;s borrowings were held by banks and other financial institutions, but banks may also have indirect exposure to the developer&#39;s suppliers, who are owed 667 billion yuan for goods and services.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Smaller banks with higher exposure to Evergrande or to other vulnerable developers could face significant increases in non-performing loans (NPLs), depending on how any credit event involving Evergrande develops,&quot; Fitch said.</p>\n\n<p>But the agency added a recent People’s Bank of China sensitivity test showed the average capital adequacy ratio of the 4,000 banks in the country would only drop modestly if the NPL ratio for property-development loans were to rise by 15 basis points.</p>\n\n<p>Evergrande&#39;s Hong Kong-listed stock slipped as much as another 5% to HK$2.82 on Wednesday morning, a fresh low since Jan 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Its property management unit (6666.HK) and EV unit (0708.HK), however, bounced as much as 10.4% and 9.3%, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In the debt market, Evergrande&#39;s Shanghai traded July 2022 bond fell 5.6% to 28.3 yuan, while its dollar bond due March 2022 dropped 20% to 27.502 cents, yielding more than 500%.</p>\n\n<p>Fitch also said the risk of significant pressure on house prices in the event of a default would be low, and it expected the government would act to protect households’ interests to ensure home deliveries.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, roughly 40 protesters stood near the entrance at Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, prevented from going inside by dozens of security personnel.</p>\n\n<p>This followed chaotic scenes at the headquarters two days earlier, as disgruntled investors crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products.</p>\n\n<p>Some videos circulating on Chinese social media also showed what were described as Evergrande-related protests elsewhere in China.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pok52d/china_has_just_told_investors_that_chinese/","title":"China has just told investors that Chinese Commercial
