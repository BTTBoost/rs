I suffer from anxiety and have been keeping it in my savings. I knew I should invest it, but the fear of losing my mom&#39;s gift to me was debilitating. Now I&#39;m on wellbutrin and it&#39;s helped me alot. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I woke up and opened a brokerage account and shoved 500$ into AMD, INTEL, FORD, and some of that game store stock. (Hehehe)</p>\n\n<p>After breakfast I took 60k and parked it in a high interest savings account for now. .55%</p>\n\n<p>During lunch I took 10k and put in into a 10 year fidelity GO 60/40 account. (I have mixed feelings about bonds but it&#39;s better than letting it sit in savings.)</p>\n\n<p>Not sure what to do now. I&#39;d like to keep at least 20k available in case I decided to buy a house. But beyond that I&#39;m just not sure. Still worried there is a bubble In the economy and scared shitless I&#39;m going to lose this gift.</p>\n\n<p>Edit- about game stocks, I only have half a week&#39;s net wages in it. Nothing crazy.</p>\n\n<p>I really appreciate All the advice. I&#39;m going to be busy looking up dividends, indexes, fiduciaries and reference your comments in the future.</p>\n\n<p>As for that guy at the bottom, who said I&#39;m bragging... Id give everything I have and MORE to have my mom back and in good heath.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/md57ak/mom_left_me_some_money/","title":"Mom left me some money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T21:25:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 21:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c93c58d4-83aa-5c87-bc0a-cef519f81912","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/md57ak/mom_left_me_some_money/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/md57ak/mom_left_me_some_money/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"4rotorguy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/4rotorguy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"4rotorguy","score":700,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"妈妈给我留了一些钱","the_new_excerpt":"妈妈去年7月自杀身亡，保险赔了8万。我患有\n焦虑，一直把它放在我的储蓄里。我知道我应该投资它，但\n害怕失去我妈妈给我的礼物，这让我很沮丧。现在我在服用安非他命\n这对我帮助很大。\n\n昨天我醒来后开了一家经纪公司... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"媽媽給我留了一些錢","the_new_excerpt":"媽媽去年7月自殺身亡，保險賠了8萬。我患有\n焦慮，一直把它放在我的儲蓄裏。我知道我應該投資它，但\n害怕失去我媽媽給我的禮物，這讓我很沮喪。現在我在服用安非他命\n這對我幫助很大。\n\n昨天我醒來後開了一家經紀公司... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ee7eb207-0d56-51b0-9a24-90e3ee87187c","excerpt":"The panic of 1901 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901] was caused by a\nstandoff between J.P.
