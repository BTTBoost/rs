They wlll have to sell after the market opens right? And the market wil open much lower than 36,000.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, if word gets out that certain investors were able to sell, while retail investors were unable to get their orders filled this could lead to a full scale revolt. </p>\n\n<p>Is this concern legitimate, or are their controls in place to prevent retail investors from getting hosed while the well connected all exit their long positions?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qu188u/if_people_were_angry_when_brokers_halted_gme_buys/","title":"If people were angry when brokers halted GME buy's, what would happen if a stock market crash occurs and ordinary investors are not able to sell?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-15T06:31:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-15 06:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qu188u","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qu188u/if_people_were_angry_when_brokers_halted_gme_buys/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qu188u/if_people_were_angry_when_brokers_halted_gme_buys/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"warrenfgerald","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/warrenfgerald","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"warrenfgerald","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"証券会社がGMEの買いを止めたときに人々が怒ったとして、もし株式市場が暴落して一般の投資家が売れなくなったらどうなるだろうか。","the_new_excerpt":"ある投資アドバイザーのポッドキャストを聞いていたところ、彼と彼の顧客はすべて株式をロングしていて、ストップロスを設定していると言っていました。\nストップロスオーダーをかけていると言っていました。\n暴落に備えてストップロスの注文をしている。市場が上昇すると、逆指値を上げます。\n\nしかし、市場が閉鎖されている場合、あるいは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如果人们在经纪人停止购买GME时感到愤怒，那么，如果股票市场崩溃，普通投资者无法卖出，会发生什么？","the_new_excerpt":"我刚刚听了一个投资顾问的播客，他说他和他的客户都是做多股票的。\n他说他和他的客户都是做多股票的，而且他们都有止损单，以防崩盘。\n以防出现崩溃。随着市场的上涨，他们会提高止损价格。\n\n然而，我想知道，如果市场关闭，这将如何运作，或...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果人們在經紀人停止購買GME時感到憤怒，那麼，如果股票市場崩潰，普通投資者無法賣出，會發生什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"我剛剛聽了一個投資顧問的播客，他說他和他的客戶都是做多股票的。\n他說他和他的客戶都是做多股票的，而且他們都有止損單，以防崩盤。\n以防出現崩潰。隨着市場的上漲，他們會提高止損價格。\n\n然而，我想知道，如果市場關閉，這將如何運作，或...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qu77t9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qu77t9/waiting_for_the_evergrande_collapse/","title":"Waiting for the Evergrande Collapse.","date":"November 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"エバーグランデ崩壊を待っています。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"等待恒大崩盘。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"等待恆大崩盤。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qu188u","previousId":"RedditPost-qu77t9","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qu188u/if_people_were_angry_when_brokers_halted_gme_buys/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
