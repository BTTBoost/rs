Do you enjoy playing arcade games and hanging out with friends? Miss the good old days of watching live sporting events on the big screen while cheering along with the crowd? Would you like to be on the All-Star team of degenerates? If you answered yes to the following questions, you are in the right community and have arrived at the right place. Today we will be discussing the case of Dave and Buster’s ($PLAY). First a quick graphic so I don’t lose you:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r027z9n3nz771.jpg?width=1430&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2e322899f1c83b0548f706da52eaabe2867c626\">  “So you’re telling me I can start going to the arcade again?”</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Thesis: Mr. market does not fully appreciate the intrinsic value held within the core business model of Dave &amp; Busters ($PLAY). The combination deals offered by the company for food and gaming credits give patrons a unique experience and all but ensure that revenue will continue to increase as store count reaches its targeted levels.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>We’re going to break down today’s presentation into the following topics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction to Dave and Buster’s ($PLAY)</li>\n<li>Business model</li>\n<li>Current financial condition</li>\n<li>Growth Potential</li>\n<li>Catalyst for 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dave and Buster’s ($PLAY) is a leading owner and operator of high-volume venues in North America that combine dining and entertainment for both adults and families. Founded in Dallas, Texas in 1982, the core concept is to offer customers the opportunity to “Eat Drink Play and Watch” all in one location. Eat and Drink are offered through a full menu of entrees and appetizers and a full selection of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. Play and Watch offerings provide an extensive assortment of entertainment attractions centered around playing games and watching live sports. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6tlcgw6inz771.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=909f8d298f49119725a3c338cd64ee64a8589e71\">  “After I lap you Tom I’m going to make love to your wife”</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Business model –</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Patrons enter Dave &amp; Buster’s ($PLAY) with a choice of four options to choose from; this is the core business model that differentiates Dave &amp; Buster’s from its competitors. Patrons can dine in, play amusement games in the midway, have a seat at the bar or enjoy the big screen view of live sporting events. Although the company acknowledges that it is in a competitive market, it is also aware that there is no other competitor that can offer all the forms of entertainment that it provides in one single location. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My belief is that although customer experience from competition might be similar, it is not of the same scale that Dave &amp; Buster’s is able to deliver. This is because of the company’s direct import program.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Through this program, Dave &amp; Buster’s is able to acquire the latest amusement attractions/games from foreign suppliers at discounted rates due to the company’s size and buying power. Since the company is a large buyer of amusement games, they receive discounts that local competitors would not be eligible for. This is essential to the business model and provides for a sizeable advantage over other venues attempting to offer similar services. </p>\n\n<p>Because the company can acquire items for discounted prices, <strong>it enjoys a whopping 89.3% gross margin in entertainment offerings</strong>. This sector makes up 64% of the company’s overall revenue. Being that income from entertainment is the primary source of revenue for the company, Dave &amp; Buster’s is less reliant on its food offerings. This means that during times of rising food costs, the company is less exposed than it would otherwise be. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5z6le6jtnz771.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fbc5bc19d933946b6fd926c6a3879fbb68359fc\">  Live Feed from the Headquarters of Dave &amp; Buster’s competitors </a></p>\n\n<p>Their “Eat Drink Play and Watch” business model is broken down as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eat\n\n<ul>\n<li>Patrons can choose from a menu that appeals to a broad spectrum of customers.  Menu items include burgers and handhelds, choice-grade steaks, and pasta. There are also options available to diet conscious individuals such as vegetarian, low calorie and gluten friendly delights. Menu items are ever evolving reflecting the changing tastes of customers.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Drink\n\n<ul>\n<li>Each location offers full bar service, including a variety of beers, hand-crafted cocktails, and premium spirits.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Play\n\n<ul>\n<li>The company calls this area the midway. It features a wide array of amusement and entertainment options of which some are exclusive to Dave and Buster’s on a permanent basis. This is the feature that the company feels most differentiates its brand from all others. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Watch\n\n<ul>\n<li>All locations have multiple large screen televisions and high-quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports events and other immersive programming. The company believes they have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience for customers.<br/></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qc1opl15oz771.jpg?width=952&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c7ab2885f1d17545e8c9cd57b22c20ceef82b0\">https://preview.redd.it/qc1opl15oz771.jpg?width=952&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c7ab2885f1d17545e8c9cd57b22c20ceef82b0</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Current financial condition –</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Business for 2020 was significantly hampered by the economic conditions that resulted from the closures of public venues due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Much reference is made in the company’s annual report of the impact that the pandemic had on its business. Based on Benjamin Graham’s principles in his book “<em>The Intelligent Investor,”</em> heavy emphasis should not be placed on a single year’s earnings for a company. If there were any year that this principle applied to most, it would be fiscal 2020 due to the unusual circumstances resulting from the pandemic. </p>\n\n<p>The real appeal for why I like the stock can be found when breaking down the numbers preceding fiscal 2020. There is a consistent pattern of growth year after year for as far back as financial statements have been released for the company. When comparing the numbers from 2020 to 2013, there is a 222% increase in revenue from just that period of time alone. This leads me to believe that <strong>Dave &amp; Buster’s ($PLAY) has a successful business model that is not only profitable but also expanding</strong>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9u15ank9oz771.png?width=1752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae5d0e5dafc244695629871ba06222299bdec83c\">  BRRRRRRRRR</a></p>\n\n<p>$PLAY used proceeds from the issuance of senior secured notes along with its cash on hand to repay the principal balance of its term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility. This point is of particular interest because it speaks to the credibility of a company when amid a pandemic it is able to pay down its existing debt and has not forsaken its responsibilities. </p>\n\n<p>Another sign of enthusiasm for the financial outlook of the company is the opening of five new stores in the second half of 2020. We can rely on the numbers for prior years to conclude that an increase in the number of stores equals a proportionate increase in revenue and net income. As of May 2, 2021, business is getting back to usual for the company; 138 out of 141 stores are operating in some capacity. The company believes that through its financial restructuring initiatives of the past year, it has sufficient liquidity to meet estimated cash flow needs and covenant compliance obligations for the future. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Growth Potential –</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Internal studies and third party research suggest that the company has significant growth opportunities. Dave &amp; Buster’s expects to expand to over 230 stores in the future. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dx047pufoz771.png?width=1760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a4b7dbb4ea9c0a1f8dcfa704d7e81f1d28414f2\">https://preview.redd.it/dx047pufoz771.png?width=1760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a4b7dbb4ea9c0a1f8dcfa704d7e81f1d28414f2</a></p>\n\n<p>The company is well positioned to expand into new markets and expects that 2021 will be one of its best years. The coming end of the covid-19 restrictions will bring about enthusiasm from the general public for the company’s venues. It will maintain a moderate pace of new store openings for the year and has its vision set for long term future growth. </p>\n\n<p>A commitment to customer satisfaction weighs heavily on the company as it understands that positive experiences drive better return rates from customers. Dave &amp; Buster’s ($PLAY) has consistently scored higher in customer satisfaction benchmarks year after year. A part of the company’s initiative to bring about additional store traffic is its loyalty/rewards program. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Catalyst for 2021 –</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Dave &amp; Buster’s has invested time and resources in developing and implementing new technology platforms that will allow it to digitally engage customers. Central to this effort is the company’s investment in their mobile application platform. The mobile application platform resolves to enhance existing customer satisfaction and attract new customers by providing exclusive offers and discounts. <strong>Dave &amp; Buster’s intends to launch a new loyalty program in 2021 which will be integrated into the mobile application</strong> to provide further functionality and accessibility to customers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I believe this initiative will be huge for the company.</strong> It will serve as a direct line for delivering offers &amp; coupons to individuals who download the mobile application. Research has shown that customers are driven by discounts. The likelihood of customers returning to stores increases significantly when coupons and offers give the customer an additional incentive to visit. </p>\n\n<p><strong>It is for these reasons that I believe Dave &amp; Buster’s ($PLAY) will thrive and continue to expand its presence in the years ahead.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: $PLAY is the one stop shop to eat, play, watch &amp; drink. Its direct import program allows the company to cycle through the latest games and attractions for a fraction of the price given to its competitors. $PLAY is looking to expand into additional markets in the years ahead. It provides its existing customers loyalty rewards to keep them coming back.   </p>\n\n<p>Position: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tb2wxhmloz771.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a48348aad1fa1aa1bd61782599178282dfe3eb8\">https://preview.redd.it/tb2wxhmloz771.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a48348aad1fa1aa1bd61782599178282dfe3eb8</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.
