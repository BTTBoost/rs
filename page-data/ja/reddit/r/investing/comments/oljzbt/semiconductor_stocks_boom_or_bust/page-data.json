That’s good for semiconductor stocks right? Yes, but also in my opinion, maybe not.</p>\n\n<p>Why you ask? Well the fact that there is a shortage, literally means that there is a supply issue. They can’t keep up with the demand. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, semiconductor stocks must be booming right? Right, but now that so many investors have come to the same conclusion, they rush to these semiconductor stocks, pumping the price up. Good for everyone who owns shares.</p>\n\n<p>Now here comes the issue- whenever a company grows, their P/E ratio naturally grows as well as it is directly tied to the company’s earnings. If the P/E ratio of a stock goes up, the earnings need to follow or else it doesn’t warrant for the additional price growth.</p>\n\n<p>Now here is where we bring the discussion back to the problem at hand- chip shortage.</p>\n\n<p>With there being a shortage of chips, semiconductor companies are unable to keep up with the demand, essentially bottlenecking the companies earnings growth. You can’t keep growing and producing more revenue if you can’t produce inventory fast enough to keep up with the demand, meaning the companies earnings won’t be able to grow at the same rate as the share price, proving those price levels to be unsustainable, resulting in a drop in share price.</p>\n\n<p>THIS IS MY OPINION/THEORY, FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION BELOW</p>\n\n<p>tldr; chip shortage means semiconductors can’t produce enough chips for the current demand, meaning their revenue can’t grow to sustain the growth of the share price- post  your thoughts</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>A company can grow for years, although if their P/E ratios are blown out of proportion, the share price may be stagnant, or even drop for that matter, simply due to the fact that it just couldn’t grow fast enough. If a company is priced at a p/e of 40, that means an investor is willing to wait 40 years to make back his initial investment if earnings are to stay the same. If the stock doubles and the P/E ratio is 80, well, guess what that means. Either way, there is no way companies that are already priced at these levels can just consistently grow their earnings at a 30-40% rate for even 3 years in a row. They would take over the world. Not to mention that if they decide to grow by raising their prices, that will raise the prices on the rest of the supply chain that utilizes the chips (lol, everything). What does that contribute to? Inflation.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR; think about every time a stock beats earnings and seems to be flat or even drop. That’s due to a high P/E ratio, meaning it didn’t grow at the rate it needed to support those price levels</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oljzbt/semiconductor_stocks_boom_or_bust/","title":"Semiconductor Stocks- Boom or Bust?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-16T21:50:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-16 21:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"4170738b-e347-584e-b5e0-4222dbb38ade","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oljzbt/semiconductor_stocks_boom_or_bust/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oljzbt/semiconductor_stocks_boom_or_bust/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"PaulP97","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PaulP97","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PaulP97","score":98,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"半導体関連株はブームかバストか？","the_new_excerpt":"周知の通り、世界的にチップが不足しており、需要は過去最高となっています。\n高くなっています。これは半導体株にとっては良いことですよね？そうですが、私の意見では、そうではありません。\nしかし、私の意見では、そうではないかもしれません。\n\nなぜかって？不足しているということは、文字通り供給に問題があるということです。\n供給に問題があるということです。彼らはそれに追いつけない...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"半导体股票-繁荣还是萧条？","the_new_excerpt":"正如我们都知道的，有一个全球性的芯片短缺，而需求是在一个历史的高点\n高。这对半导体股票来说是好事，对吗？是的，但在我看来也是。\n也许不是。\n\n你问为什么？事实上，有一个短缺，从字面上看，意味着有一个\n是一个供应问题。他们无法跟上...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"半導體股票-繁榮還是蕭條？","the_new_excerpt":"正如我們都知道的，有一個全球性的芯片短缺，而需求是在一個歷史的高點\n高。這對半導體股票來說是好事，對嗎？是的，但在我看來也是。\n也許不是。\n\n你問爲什麼？事實上，有一個短缺，從字面上看，意味着有一個\n是一個供應問題。他們無法跟上...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-74cfc6b4-7658-5791-91d7-49b1885f450b","excerpt":"It seems like the more I delve into individual stock picking and trying to outdo\nSPY my eyes are opening to the blatant bs I mainstream news... but there has to\nbe a resource that is more reliable?
