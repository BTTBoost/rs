I had to leave my car by the big menu and microphone.  Seemed like some cars were just as frustrated as they started honking.</p>\n\n<p>3) There was no one taking tickets to get into the playground area.  Anyone could have gotten for free.</p>\n\n<p>4) The restaurant had a grand total of 22 people in it.   Only 2 of which looked homeless.</p>\n\n<p>5) The Big Mac and Fries were $6 together.  It’s so much cheaper to kill the cow and cook the burger yourself.</p>\n\n<p>This is a doomed business unless something drastically changes.  People are cooking burgers for cheaper.  Big Mac numbers are way down maybe i don’t really know.</p>\n\n<p>I will be surprised if McDonalds is still around by 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Apes be careful with this one.</p>\n\n<p>Post this is in reference to is here: reddit.com<a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ond48t/observations_of_an_amc_theater/\">/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ond48t/observations_of_an_amc_theater/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onr3vc/next_big_short_observations_of_a_mcdonalds/","title":"Next Big Short: Observations of a McDonalds","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-20T05:29:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-20 05:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6bdb0b9c-7e4f-5f5d-bec1-a05e5245ebe7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onr3vc/next_big_short_observations_of_a_mcdonalds/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onr3vc/next_big_short_observations_of_a_mcdonalds/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"ACrustyBusStation","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ACrustyBusStation","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ACrustyBusStation","score":2474,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ネクスト・ビッグ・ショート：マクドナルドでの観察結果","the_new_excerpt":"今週末、近所のマクドナルドでハンバーガーショップに行ってきました。\nで、いくつかのことを観察しました。\n\n1) 金曜日の午後2時30分、駐車場は1/8しか埋まっていなかった。\n\n2)駐車場には係員がいなかった。私は大きなメニューのそばに車を置かなければなりませんでした。\nそして...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"下一个大空头：一个麦当劳的观察报告","the_new_excerpt":"这个周末我去了我附近的麦当劳的汉堡店（美国第二好的城市\n美国第二好的城市），我观察到几件事\n\n1）在一个周五下午2:30，停车场只有1/8的空间。\n\n2）停车场没有代客泊车。我不得不把我的车放在大菜单旁边\n和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"下一個大空頭：一個麥當勞的觀察報告","the_new_excerpt":"這個週末我去了我附近的麥當勞的漢堡店（美國第二好的城市\n美國第二好的城市），我觀察到幾件事\n\n1）在一個週五下午2:30，停車場只有1/8的空間。\n\n2）停車場沒有代客泊車。我不得不把我的車放在大菜單旁邊\n和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bffd017b-497d-56dd-ae95-51328be130aa","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onsh5m/flawless_execution/","title":"Flawless execution","date":"July 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"完璧な実行","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"无瑕的执行","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"無瑕的執行","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-5f4331ba-93fe-5f7d-a86e-7b983bc48c44","excerpt":"Portillos (Chicago based fast casual hot dog/Italian beef chain) to go public\nwith valuation of $2.5-$3 billion.\n[https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-portillos-ipo-filing-20210719-mf6hlqgxnjcd7p3pfj2fbgaoze-story.html]\n\nThey brought in $455 million in sales in 2020, which was down only 7%…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/onktqm/portillos_to_go_public/","title":"Portillos to go public","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 20, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ポルティージョが上場へ","the_new_excerpt":"Portillos社（シカゴを拠点とするファストカジュアルのホットドッグ／イタリアンビーフチェーン）が株式公開へ\n評価額は25億ドルから30億ドル。\n[https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-portillos-ipo-filing-20210719-mf6hlqgxnjcd7p3pfj2fbgaoze-story.html]\n\n彼らは2020年に4億5500万ドルの売上をもたらしたが、これはわずか7％の減少に過ぎない...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"波蒂略公司将上市","the_new_excerpt":"Portillos（位于芝加哥的快速休闲热狗/意大利牛肉连锁店）将上市\n估值为25-30亿美元。\n[https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-portillos-ipo-filing-20210719-mf6hlqgxnjcd7p3pfj2fbgaoze-story.html]\n\n他们在2020年带来了4.55亿美元的销售收入，只下降了7%...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"波蒂略公司將上市","the_new_excerpt":"Portillos（位於芝加哥的快速休閒熱狗/意大利牛肉連鎖店）將上市\n估值爲25-30億美元。\n[https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-portillos-ipo-filing-20210719-mf6hlqgxnjcd7p3pfj2fbgaoze-story.html]\n\n他們在2020年帶來了4.55億美元的銷售收入，只下降了7%...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-6bdb0b9c-7e4f-5f5d-bec1-a05e5245ebe7","previousId":"RedditPost-bffd017b-497d-56dd-ae95-51328be130aa","nextId":"RedditPost-5f4331ba-93fe-5f7d-a86e-7b983bc48c44","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onr3vc/next_big_short_observations_of_a_mcdonalds/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
