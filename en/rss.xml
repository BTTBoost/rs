&lt;p&gt;I am looking into three stocks which includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fortitudegold.com/&quot;&gt;Fortitude Gold&lt;/a&gt; (FTCO). They are a small producer but a good thing about them is that they have no debts. They recently increased their dividend by 14%, and reported positive results in their Golden Mile property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threevalleycopper.com/&quot;&gt;Three Valley Copper&lt;/a&gt; (TVC) since they’re showing great potential too. They announced a financing with a deal brought about by investor demand, financing the company with $16 million dollars. They are expected to start mining early 2022 and will potentially produce 13-16 thousand tonnes of copper cathodes in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit, TSLA is at $1T valuation and won’t stop there most likely. Yes, yes, I know Tesla is NoT jUsT aN EV cOmPaNy. But still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is, what is the hype with EV stocks? I understand that it is a rapidly growing industry since mandates and adoption will allow EVs to replace ICE vehicles in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, automaker margins are freaking terrible. I just don’t see the appeal of auto maker stocks going up just because they are going EV. There will be lots of competitors (obviously), beit the new companies like Lucid, Rivian, and Tesla and the legacy makers like Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. Also, it’s not like EV is some niche field where duopolies or monopolies will thrive either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also not mention that EVs will cost more to make when compared to ICE. So it’s not like auto makers are going to cut major costs like when Ford introduced the assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just want to start a discussion and hear people’s thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, I’m not shorting or buying puts. Just genuinely surprised that this EV bubble or rally - whatever you want to call it - is still going strong. Especially in times of inflation fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than rates, covid spike, inflation… my biggest concern was by far a change in Powell because the market hates change and unexpected news. I could totally see this resulting in what should have probably already happened with a correction especially with big market cap stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did $645M in revenue in 2020, and are projecting $1.6B in 2021. Right now, the SPAC is valued at just $1.55B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you all probably know by now the popular social media company formerly known as Facebook has changed its name to Meta. This has sparked discussions about the Metaverse and its future effect on society, and rightfully so. Although I have seen many posts online and especially on Reddit which don’t quite seem to grasp what the Metaverse is and why it&amp;#39;s the future, please note if you are one of these people don’t worry - it’s complicated for sure! This post will explain simply what the Metaverse is and why you should get on board now. I will do my best to explain but if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments and I will be sure to reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse put simply is the combination of multiple elements of technology, but put more complexly is where virtual reality, blockchain and web3 meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way of explaining web3 is to first understand web1 and web2. Web1 is what many may consider the first stage of the internet, if you look at what the first iterations of the internet were, it was just code on a screen. It was complex to use and only really used for sharing scientific work. Web2 is what we now know as the internet. This includes Youtube, Reddit etc. The main downside of web2 is for the longest time other than a domain name you couldn’t own anything online. You could make a video and post it on Youtube, even though you feel you own the video and control it, Youtube at any point can remove the video and even your channel. At any point in time everything online can be controlled by someone else. This is where web3 comes in. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. Web3 may as well be called the decentralised internet. It allows users to freely use the internet run on blockchain, so anyone can participate without having your personal data involved or monetized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big reason crypto based items such as coins and NFT’s have taken off as they are based on web3 technology. For the first time normal everyday people are able to own their own little part of the internet, and no one, including the government, can tell you what to do. It&amp;#39;s the next step for total freedom online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse isn’t a place, the Metaverse isn’t something you can touch. A big mistake I see is people think that there is going to be some sort of invention or overnight change where suddenly the Metaverse is mainstream and that&amp;#39;s our lives, no. It will be a gradual change which has already started and will continue to the point that our virtual life is worth more to us than our physical lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the Metaverse the next big thing?:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best place to start on why the Metaverse will be the next big thing will be to look back at previous technology. 99% of human attention used to be on our physical environment. TV’s dropped that to 85%. Computers dropped that to 70%. Phones dropped that to 50%. It&amp;#39;s clear that as technology advances it absorbs more and more of our time and energy. At some point something new will drop that to lower and lower numbers to the point where we are using technology 100% of the time, this may take decades but it&amp;#39;s entirely possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be something mind-blowing but just imagine some type of augmented reality device which either connects to your brain or you see it through contact lenses, imagine it just helped with basic everyday things like arrows on a road so you don&amp;#39;t have to distract yourself with a GPS, or walking into a McDonalds and being able to see the calories of each food item on the menu. These are just basic examples of what the first iteration of augmented reality can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse will be the next big thing because &lt;strong&gt;it will be everything.&lt;/strong&gt; Anything you could imagine will be in the Metaverse. It can range from anything from gaming to concerts to seeing family members from the other side of the world. There is no beginning, middle and end, it&amp;#39;s just infinite code waiting to be filled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life application and potential benefits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the potential benefits I want to start with isn’t about what will be good inside the Metaverse but outside it. A comment I’m seeing a lot online is people saying “I want to work on fixing the real world, not create a fake one”. But I think people are missing the point that this will make the real world better. Imagine the millions of cars we can get off the road and reduce pollution if people no longer had to drive to work and school, and instead would stay at home and work in the Metaverse. Of course this may vary depending on the industry but even if we could get 50% of cars off the road it would be a massive achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this more and more benefits keep popping in my head, I will just briefly write some ideas but it&amp;#39;s really going to be endless. Surgeons can practice their work virtually. Architects can design and walk around buildings before construction. Home buyers can visit a home from their own home. People on lower incomes can travel the world from their living room. Schools can visit any museum. Entrepreneurs and businesses can save money on office space. Lovers of history can travel to any time desired (DINOSAURS!). The list really is endless, so I will stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential negatives and why it won’t matter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any new technology there are always downsides. When the microwave first came out people were terrified of it, same with TV, radio, social media and now the Metaverse. I will note that is a good thing. As a society we should always look to protect ourselves and do what&amp;#39;s best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse won’t be perfect. Even nowadays cyber bullying is a major issue and it may not be any better in the Metaverse. We will distance ourselves further from the real world. Spending less and less physical time with our friends and family and more virtual time with them. The thing is though, the negatives don’t matter. Whether it&amp;#39;s good or bad technology has always advanced on and those who don’t get on board are left behind. Many said at the birth of the internet that it would be bad but it is undoubtedly the best thing to happen to humanity in the past century, and this will have the same effect. I greatly encourage those to at least have an open mind when it comes to the Metaverse, we are on the dawn of something great and those who capitalise on it will be rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long until the Metaverse is ready and becomes mainstream?:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very hard question. Actually, I think this is an impossible question. You could try and rephrase it to ‘How long until the internet is ready and becomes mainstream?’ At no point does anyone announce the internet is ready and at no point is it officially called mainstream. At some point it just became what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse creation will be gradual, it will most likely take a decade minimum but my guess is as good as yours. I think the point at which we accept as a society that the Metaverse is ready is when our digital selves are worth more than our physical selves. You even start to see it now. Kids care more about how they look on Fortnite than in real life. Teens care more about how many followers they have on Instagram than in real life. The world has and always will be  changing with technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy and how to make profit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could list any number of companies which could make you great gains in the near future, including FB, MSFT, U, RBLX, AMZN, ADSK etc. and I would be completely wrong! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I and many others may know a lot about the Metaverse, the truth is we won’t be able to predict even 1% of what the final product will be. If you asked a million people before the internet what the most popular websites would be you wouldn’t get a single right answer. No one knows so anyone telling you what to buy don’t actually have a clue. Yes you can make money in the short term but that’s it. Remember the dot com bubble? Watch out for a Metaverse bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts are to tell people now to worry. This isn’t some doomsday device, it’s better to just see it as an extension of your phone. The truth is we are years off of anything serious and no one is going to be forced to use it. I also don’t see any chance of it being stopped by the government as I see some people online say. Sugar and cigarettes are bad but they are legal too. I would recommend anyone to at least try and allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to one of the bigger stock names linked to the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

I really think this is a new paradigm, not as in oh market goes up forever and this time is different, and more as in this amount of QE and stimulus mixed with bare bones low interest rate has never been achieved before. We have never had a market with the combination of those 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s how I see things going forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dumb money is here to stay. There&amp;#39;s just too damn much of it flooding the market looking for a home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail investor sentiment has changed. No one is risk-adverse on a broad scale anymore. Investors are willing to hold through dips and plunge more cash into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest rates are rock bottom, and there&amp;#39;s the possibility they stay that way or go negative due to debt implications if they&amp;#39;re raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s going to change? Is retail suddenly going to become risk adverse? Is the amount of capital flooding the system going to be reigned in? Are interest rates going to drastically rise, if at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think so. I quite literally think that given market conditions and sentiment a correction is not even possible. Do all the remind me&amp;#39;s you want. The market is unable to correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE SUPER CHARGER NETWORK. This is basically a system of electric gas stations that charge your car in 30-40 minutes, and allows you to drive ANYWHERE in America and Canada. You can drive from San Diego to NYC with this network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what you can&amp;#39;t do with a Rivian or Lucid? Drive anywhere you don&amp;#39;t normally drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to charge your car at a charge port or whatever, it&amp;#39;ll take you 8 hours for a full charge. The only reason Tesla is worth anything is because of their phenomenal super charger network. How the fuck are lucid and rivian going to compete with that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned congressional leadership Tuesday that the federal government could default on its debt next month if they don’t take action to raise the debt ceiling.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a letter to top lawmakers, Ms. Yellen projected that after Dec. 15, there are scenarios in which the Treasury could have “insufficient resources to continue to finance the operation of the U.S. government.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Yellen added that she has “a high degree of confidence” in the Treasury’s ability to make debt payments through Dec. 15. That’s two weeks longer than her initial forecast of Dec. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks gained today, with market participants releasing a sigh of relief as new economic data showed consumer demand remains strong despite ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages. Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Lowe’s (LOW), and Home Depot (HD) are set to release quarterly earnings this week, giving us more information into the state of consumer spending in the US. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core Retail Sales: +1.6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing Production: +1.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Shay, President of the National Retail Federation, said of the report, “Today’s numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping. We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, two of the largest retailers in the US, Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD), reported earnings today, with both companies demolishing earnings (though WMT stock did not react positively). Here are the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walmart (WMT)&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue: $140.53 billion vs $135.60 billion expected &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings per Share (EPS): $1.45 vs $1.40 expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sames Store Sales: +9.2% vs +6.9% expected &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eCommerce Sales: +8% vs +1.9% expected &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Depot (HD)&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue: $36.82 billion vs $35.01 billion expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings per Share (EPS): $3.92 vs $3.40 expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same Store Sales: +6.1% vs 1.9% expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reports came at the tail end of what has already been an exceptionally strong earnings season. As of Friday, 92% of S&amp;amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results, and of these, 81% of them had reported better-than-expected earnings results, according to FactSet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_111221.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_111221.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow, someway, shares of Rivian (RIVN) keep rising after its blockbuster IPO, with the company now being the third largest auto manufacturer by market cap at roughly $150 billion despite barely completing any deliveries. This is, by far, the craziest valuation I’ve ever seen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that import prices rose 1.2% on a monthly basis in October, coming in well above the 0.4% rise for September. This was also above the 1.0% increase consensus economists expected for October, according to Bloomberg data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are on fire after the company projected that its chipset business will average “midteens” revenue growth through its fiscal year 2024. That’s well above the 8% average contemplated by Wall Street’s current estimates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the highly anticipated sequel to Tiger King tomorrow. It seems like Netflix has been on an amazing roll as of late and now has a higher market cap than Disney (DIS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucid Motors (LCID) has now overtaken Ford Motors (F) in market cap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (AAPL) is reportedly working to make its own in-house modem chip that allows wireless connection for iPhones by 2023. Qualcomm (QCOM), which currently supplies modem chips for all Apple devices, estimates Apple will self-supply 80% of modem chips by 2023. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with four target raises. Stock currently around $235

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citigroup from $282 to $290 at Buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wedbush from $250 to $270 at Outperform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit Suisse from $250 to $255 at Outperform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank of America from $256 to $282 at Buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datadog (DDOG) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $210 to $230 at Buy. Stock currently around $194&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucid Motors (LCID) price target raised by Citigroup from $28 to $57 at Buy. Stock currently around $57 after gapping up 25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) target raised by Benchmark from $81 to $96 at Buy. Stock currently around $85&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA (NVDA) target raised by Credit Suisse from $225 to $400 at Outperform. Stock currently around $300.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tyson Foods (TSN) with a host of target raises. Average price target $95 at Buy. Stock currently aroun d$84&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UnitedHealth Group (UNH) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $421 to $477 at Buy. Stock currently around $450&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workday (WDAY) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $320 to $350 at Buy. Stock currently around $299&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely this reckless inflatory push has something to do with competition between the US and China/Russia? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether its the fact China will overtake it quicker now or a potential conflict with either one. Could it be an experiment in whether having the “global currency” can allow a country to buy growth without insane amounts of inflation? Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve bene having issues on my IG because nearly every day now I am having to send in a video selfie for &amp;quot;verification&amp;quot;. It seems like they want every IG account totally public and not simply for people who want to browse IG anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It directly says: &amp;quot;The video will never be visible on Instagram and will be deleted within 30 days. This won&amp;#39;t use ice recognition or collect biometric data&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qt15br/this_is_just_creepy/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qt15br/this_is_just_creepy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But given the new &amp;quot;Meta&amp;quot; name so focused on the meta verse, it&amp;#39;s extremely difficult to trust they aren&amp;#39;t using biometric data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captchas and &amp;quot;image puzzles&amp;quot; have been used for years to confirm human users and reduce bot activity, and are far less intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of privacy is getting insane at this point and I just wonder where this is leading to for Meta. They say the data will be deleted within 30 days.. but I just don&amp;#39;t believe that and they are using it for some future Metaverse data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frankly wish this was a bigger news story already, because if they actually got backlash I think they would have to at least respond about it. Very interesting that I suddenly started getting these messages too around the same time Meta was announced as the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, it&amp;#39;s obvious that the calls have been leading, as you can see on the chart below. The green and purple bars at the bottom are not volume bars, they represent premiums. As you can see, recent sessions have been overwhelmingly biased towards the call side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Mr. Kotick himself has been accused by several women of mistreatment both inside and outside the workplace, and in some instances has worked to settle the complaints quickly and quietly, according to people familiar with the incidents and documents reviewed by the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only about 4% of companies worth over $10b have grown sales at, or above, 20% over the last 10 years. This figure drops to 2% if you include all US SEC reporting businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means, roughly, about 20% of your stock market valuations are insanely overpriced. Rivian being one of them. That paired with the Shiller P/E being close to all-time highs, and inflation spiking well above expectation, signals potential disaster on the horizon. Be careful out there peeps. If the FED starts talking rate hikes, expect a sell-off. &lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m wondering whether there&amp;#39;s an advantage to going with a group like this and what sort of benefit I&amp;#39;d see over SPY all the way. They told me in their sales pitch they determine asset allocation and they have great research blah blah etc, then have what sound like their own mini funds and at a higher level REITs available only to high net worth clients. No crypto exposure, no nft&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all seems extremely old school and outdated. Am I missing something? They have my wife 30% bonds in her early 30&amp;#39;s, which seems...short sighted. They couldn&amp;#39;t give me a straight answer on how they do compared with a passive index fund&lt;/p&gt;
