I see more and more on Reddit, this sub or others, that there is a lack of FA -only TA. Or, like in <a href=\"/r/investing\">r/investing</a> today complaining that this sub is all backwards looking and focuses on past performance. This is my answer. </p>\n\n<p>Let me know suggestions or how I can improve. I had some graphs in the original PDF I mad, but left them out here because no images are aloud. Thanks for reading!</p>\n\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<h1>BTI Fundamental Analysis</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Price Target $50 – 28% Discounted</h1>\n\n<h2>OUTLOOK</h2>\n\n<p>It is no surprise that e-cigarettes are fundamentally changing the tobacco industry. E-cigs have been around a while, but there is apparently less loyalty to certain old guard brands. Consumers are more and more health conscious, yet most likely conventional tobacco products will still dominant the industry for the next decade. Still, Big Tobacco companies are still investing into the new forms in order to win over customers. </p>\n\n<p>As of today, British American Tobacco has a very well hedged position in the new forms of tobacco consumption, thus preparing itself for a shift in consumer demand. Their Vype brand is becoming more and more popular in the United Kingdom, and they recently acquired Reynolds which gives them access to Vuse. In 2020 British American Tobacco spent GBP 121 million on research and development, yet that is much smaller than their competitor Philip Morris Tobacco who spent GBP 356 million last year. British American Tobacco (BAT) is also lagging in major new categories. In traditional tobacco products, BAT has taken 6% in Japan last year, but still not as much as Philip Morris. Nevertheless, BAT is determined to become more competitive and has set a target of GBP 5 billion of revenue generated from next generational products by 2025. Vaping has lower barriers to entry and lower profit margins than traditional tobacco by fire, therefore revenue growth might not be the key growth performance indicator. </p>\n\n<p>Notably, British American Tobacco has acquired Reynolds American to increase their stake in the combustible tobacco business. Reynolds American owns the brand Newport which still has a strong presence and consumer loyalty compared to others. Their volume is declining slower than others in the US and Newport’s are priced competitively. This is probably the major reason for recent weakness in British American Tobacco’s stock price as increased fears of menthol regulation and the strategic acquisition of Reynolds exposes BAT to the menthol category even more. </p>\n\n<h2>PRICE TARGET DRIVERS</h2>\n\n<p>My price target estimate for British American Tobacco ($BTI) is $50 which implies a earnings multiple of 16 times, 12 times enterprise value (EV/EBITDA), a free cash flow yield of 7%, and a dividend yield of 5%. For the most part, these estimates are mostly inline with BAT’s comparable of Philip Morris and Imperial Brands and the historical valuations that I pulled. I believe that this is appropriate given BAT’s positioning in traditional and next generational tobacco. </p>\n\n<p>The price target will all depend on BAT’s sustainability of the operating margins for the traditional combustible business, as I think that is what they are best positioned for. I assume a 1% sales growth which is below a consumer staples sales growth of 4% and below BAT’s comparable, Philip Morris. I am also assuming a volume decline over the next 5 years of 3%. Lastly, I believe the push to next general products, including vaping, will reduce the profit margins. I assume EBIT (earnings before interest &amp; taxes) is 39.5%, which is lower than last year. </p>\n\n<h2>SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</h2>\n\n<p>British American Tobacco holds a strong franchise in the tobacco industry, which is formed by their intangible assets and cost advantage. Obviously, government regulations in the tobacco industry have made the barriers to entry almost impossible. Consumers are also continuing to be brand loyal which is creating another intangible asset for BAT. Lastly, enormous tobacco conglomerates have the advantage of scale. </p>\n\n<h3>Intangible Assets</h3>\n\n<p>Nicotine is an addictive substance which is hard to quit. Data from Tobacco Atlas states that more than 60% of smokers want to quit and as much as 42% have tried in the past 12 months. Nevertheless, globally smoking rates are barely declining which suggests that smokers have failed to quit. Also, academic research that I’ve read shows that failed attempts at quitting might be tied to premium price and brand loyalty. British American Tobacco has a very balanced cigarette portfolio, arguably one of the most balanced of all the major players. Their premium category generates around 25% of revenue, 33% in mid-tier categories, and the remainder in the affordable category. </p>\n\n<p>Government regulation combined with the fact that nicotine is addictive give BAT a competitive advantage as it reduces competition on prices. One example is that mass tobacco advertising is banned in most markets. New entrants into the market would have a hard time gaining attention. Also, the lack of marketing prevents brand switching and indirectly creates loyal customers. Compared to other industries, big tobacco doesn’t spend near as much as others in advertising. Only a mere 1.5% of sales is spent on marketing. However, it is possible that they will increase this as the next generation products, i.e., vaping is increasing in popularity. Furthermore, Point-of sale display bans don’t allow consumers to compare pricing and incentivizes brand loyalty. Therefore, manufacturers aren’t engaging in a promotional price competition. Another example of barriers to enter the tobacco industry is the US FDA. The marketing of new tobacco products is subject to FDA approval, which is not easy to get.</p>\n\n<p>Brand loyalty remains loyal in the tobacco industry and I do not see any major changes happening in the near future. This is due to challenges to enter, regulatory barriers, and restrictions on marketing. Consumer brand loyalty benefits premium tobacco products more and puts British American Tobacco right in the middle of all of its competitors, such as Philip Morris and Imperial. </p>\n\n<h3>Cost Advantage</h3>\n\n<p>British American Tobacco’s business is very scalable. The more volume of cigarettes that BAT produce, the cheaper the production cost is. In 2020, estimated production costs of a pack of BAT’s cigarettes were $0.57 on a volume of 629 billion sticks. This is in the middle of their competitors, PMI and Imperial. </p>\n\n<h3>Good Sustainability</h3>\n\n<p>Although counterintuitive in a declining industry, I believe that the British American Tobacco price target of $50 if appropriate because it is likely that the company will continue generating returns on invested capital for the foreseeable future. The sustainability of profitability and returns on capital will depend on future increases in tobacco prices that will follow inflation and declining demand. Based on past examples it seems that this is likely. In 2011, Australia implemented a series of anti-cigarette measures which led to more taxes being placed on tobacco. Over 6 years, the retail prices of cigarettes doubled and only led to a 3% drop in the smoking rate in the country. According to the World Health Organization, a pack of cigarettes now costs roughly $26 in Australia which is well above $17.80 in the UK, $6.50 in the US, and $5.50 around the globe. Assuming this example is applicable, there is plenty of room for Big Tobacco to raise their prices in order to continue being profitable. Therefore at 4% real pricing, incorporating a 2% global inflation, it might be two decades before British American Tobacco will not be able to generate rent. </p>\n\n<p>However, BAT’s recent acquisition of Reynolds American has lowered its return on invested capital generation (ROIC), and I would expect the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to remain thin. Now that BAT paid $49.4 billion for the 57.8% of Reynolds, it will be limited going forward for new acquisitions. However, I believe that BAT will still be able to create excess returns on capital. </p>\n\n<h2>CAPITAL ALLOCATION</h2>\n\n<p>Balance sheet leverage increased when British American Tobacco acquired Reynolds American. In my opinion, the deal created limited value. BAT paid 10 times enterprise value/EBITDA for the company, which lowered their ROIC. However, acquiring the product Newport and staying on top of the competition will provide future benefits, similarly in 2011 when BAT acquired Protobacco for 11 times EV/EBITDA. </p>\n\n<p>Management has also been somewhat of a problem for BAT. In April 2019, Jack Bowles, former COO of the international business, replaced by Nicandro Durante as CEO. It is still uncertain how Bowels plans to turn the business around. Now with the growing demand for next generational products and with that comes lower profit margins, I would want BAT to focus on profitable growth vs revenue growth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/or7uiv/full_research_report_dd_on_british_american/","title":"FULL Research Report & DD on British American Tobacco (BTI)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-26T02:57:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-26 02:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b86a609a-b35b-545b-9cda-09fb543f0552","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/or7uiv/full_research_report_dd_on_british_american/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/or7uiv/full_research_report_dd_on_british_american/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"prostockadvice","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/prostockadvice","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"prostockadvice","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ブリティッシュ・アメリカン・タバコ（BTI）に関するFULL Research Report & DD","the_new_excerpt":"これは、質の高い研究報告のための私の試みです。私はRedditでますます多くのことを見ています。\nこのサブでも他のサブでも、FAだけのTAが不足しているのをよく見かけます。あるいは、r/investingのように\n[/r/investing]では、今日、このサブが後ろ向きなものばかりであることを訴えていて\n過去のパフォーマンスに焦点を当てています。これが私の答えです。\n\n教えてください...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"关于英美烟草公司（BTI）的完整研究报告和DD","the_new_excerpt":"这是我对高质量研究报告的尝试。我在Reddit上看到越来越多。\n本子或其他子，有一个缺乏FA -只有TA。或者，像在r/investing\n[/r/investing]今天抱怨说，这个子都是向后看的，并且\n注重过去的表现。这是我的回答。\n\n让我知道...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於英美菸草公司（BTI）的完整研究報告和DD","the_new_excerpt":"這是我對高質量研究報告的嘗試。我在Reddit上看到越來越多。\n本子或其他子，有一個缺乏FA -只有TA。或者，像在r/investing\n[/r/investing]今天抱怨說，這個子都是向後看的，並且\n注重過去的表現。這是我的回答。\n\n讓我知道...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1419448407966560259","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1419448407966560259","title":"Bitcoin is approaching have fun staying poor levels.","date":"July 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ビットコインは貧弱な水準で楽しみながら近づいている。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"比特币正在接近有乐趣保持贫困水平。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"比特幣正在接近有樂趣保持貧困水平。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-8f844942-d4ca-5bae-a3f7-faa4cf2bafc8","excerpt":"June 29th I bought $BAESY while looking for undervalued dividend stocks, it\nappeared to have strong support at $29.25 which is about where it was sitting\nwhen I bought, now it is up ~4% since I bought to $30.5.\n\nBefore COVID hit, it was in a rally toward its upward resistance at $35, and\nwith…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/orih5d/bae_systems_is_basey_still_a_buy_after_its_rally/","title":"BAE Systems - is $BASEY still a buy after it’s rally this past month?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 26, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"BAE Systems - $BASEYはこの1ヶ月の上昇でまだ買いなのか？","the_new_excerpt":"6月29日、割安な配当銘柄を探していた私は、$BAESYを購入しました。\n29.25ドルに強い支持があるように見えましたが、それは私が買った時に座っていた場所と同じです。\n現在は30.5ドルと約4％上昇している。\n\nCOVIDがヒットする前、COVIDは35ドルの上値抵抗に向かってラリーをしていました。\nで...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"BAE系统--在过去一个月的反弹之后，BASEY仍然是一个买点吗？","the_new_excerpt":"6月29日，我在寻找被低估的红利股票时买入了$BAESY，它似乎在29.2美元有很强的支撑。\n在29.25美元处似乎有很强的支撑，这也是我买入时的位置。\n我买入时，现在它已经上涨了4%，达到30.5美元。\n\n在COVID受到冲击之前，它正朝着35美元的上行阻力位反弹，并且\n与...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"BAE系統--在過去一個月的反彈之後，BASEY仍然是一個買點嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"6月29日，我在尋找被低估的紅利股票時買入了$BAESY，它似乎在29.2美元有很強的支撐。\n在29.25美元處似乎有很強的支撐，這也是我買入時的位置。\n我買入時，現在它已經上漲了4%，達到30.5美元。\n\n在COVID受到衝擊之前，它正朝着35美元的上行阻力位反彈，並且\n與...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-b86a609a-b35b-545b-9cda-09fb543f0552","previousId":"TweetPost-1419448407966560259","nextId":"RedditPost-8f844942-d4ca-5bae-a3f7-faa4cf2bafc8","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/or7uiv/full_research_report_dd_on_british_american/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
