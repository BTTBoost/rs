This is opening a discussion for a certain factor of the gme report that is causing controversy</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: the data in figure 6 does NOT include all the shorts. It is merely a representative sample of shorts. Looking at the absolute quantity of shorts buying here is meaningless. However, given that it still seems odd to me that in the period between Feb 6th and Feb 12th, a massive quantity of shorts (something like 100% of the float) must have been covered according to this graph without any noticeable effect on price. Comments are disappearing for me for some reason and I am going to sleep. Play nice and stop downvoting comments posing resolutions other than higher than reported short interest into the ground. This is a discussion thread. Not a GME circle jerk thread. We are working through this report together to make sense of it and the purpose of this thread is to find clarity on something that seemed off to me and a bunch of other individuals not to just try to hype.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of speculation about whether the GME report suggests that shorts have not closed. The core of this comes down to the seeming disparity between this figure 5 and figure 6 of the report.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/x2pvs79nfdu71.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acd07db860fbef8fa7ca174479e2292812df46b3\">https://preview.redd.it/x2pvs79nfdu71.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acd07db860fbef8fa7ca174479e2292812df46b3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ssomo32zfdu71.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fd26f5e629a2e944ecac2ae22c4a937b1263b9\">https://preview.redd.it/ssomo32zfdu71.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fd26f5e629a2e944ecac2ae22c4a937b1263b9</a></p>\n\n<p><del>The figure 5 graph suggests that short interest fell by as much a 30% pre-new year  which corresponds to a necessary buy volume of 21 million shares. Yet, when we look at figure 6, the cumulative buy volume by short-sellers doesn&#39;t seem to come close.</del> (I&#39;m retarded and don&#39;t know my months apparently) Additionally, by feb 12 the short interest was reported around 30% (according to marketbeat) which translates to an almost 100% drop in si. A drop that big would require an average short buy volume of 4.4 million per day (70 mil/16 days). Yet figure 6 shows data not even close to that figure. This would imply extremely high levels of covering between febuary 5th and febuary 12th which doesn&#39;t seem reflected in the price action over that period.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What do the &#39;apes&#39; say: Many individuals who are bullish on gme believe that this is evidence that the short interest data being reported is faulty in some manner. They believe that the low penalties for misrepresenting short interest are causing short hedge funds to underreport their positions. We all know that the short interest heavily affects the price movement of GameStop so this has some plausibility. Others suggest that the positions are being hidden through ftds or option tomfoolery. This is potentially less plausible because the reports specifically talks about ftds and it seems like they would have mentioned options if they could hide shorts.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What do the gay bears say: Many gay bears have generally responded by arguing that the &#39;apes&#39; are seeing largely what they want to see. The report clearly states that the shorts covered and that the short interest is low (relatively speaking). Why would the SEC do something convoluted like make conflicting graphs? &#39;Apes&#39; are being conspiratorial and are interpreting it wrong if they are getting such a bizarre result.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>What are your interpretations of this data? I want to move the dialogue from unhelpful comment fights to here. (Any math I do is meant to be generally illustrative not 100% accurate)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Yeah the graphs are not in the same time period, but still looking at them and given that nearly the entire float was closed between jan 27 and feb 12. Figure 6 is still odd-looking.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Figure 6 is a bit misleading because of the size of the candles. Keep in mind while viewing that there was a huge amount of volume during this period in the realm of 100 mil a day. Still significant, but that does mean it is less than one would first think. Additionally, in the notes it makes clear that this is not all the short buy volume just those from big players. Thanks to <a href=\"/u/StonkGodCapital\">u/StonkGodCapital</a> for raising that point. However, I would say that I still think it is odd that the report implies that so much covering (of almost an entire float worth of covering) occurred during the pre-February 12th, but post squeeze period despite us seeing very boring price movement in that period.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qb81df/gme_report_seeming_conflict_between_figure_5_and/","title":"GME report: Seeming conflict between figure 5 and figure 6.
