Still, that’s less than Afterpay’s February high of AUS$158.47. The stock jumped as much as 29 per cent to AUS$125 in Sydney trading Monday.</p>\n\n<p>Square said the buy-now, pay-later concept represents a chance to capitalize on a shift away from traditional credit, especially among younger consumers. The plan is for Square to integrate Afterpay into both its consumer Cash App, and its Seller product for small businesses, Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said in an interview.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s very different from the traditional consumer-financing business model,” Ahuja said, describing “buy now, pay later” as an “alternative” to traditional credit. “Since our founding days we have seen it as a key priority for our customers, whether merchants or consumers, to get fast access to funds,” she added, but declined to say whether Square would offer other traditional finance options, like a credit card.</p>\n\n<p>Square shares were up about 3% in the first minutes of trading Monday in New York.</p>\n\n<p>Afterpay lets consumers purchase items on credit and pay later with a series of installments. It’s particularly popular with younger consumers -- who may not have a credit card -- to buy clothes, beauty products and homewares. There are no fees or interest on the loan as long as people pay on time, according to Afterpay’s website.</p>\n\n<p>The deal should also help boost Cash App’s total user base by adding Afterpay’s 16 million users to Cash App’s existing user base of 70 million annual users, Ahuja said.</p>\n\n<p>Larger competitors have pushed into the market recently, adding to the challenges for Afterpay and its peers. Apple Inc. is teaming up with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a buy now, pay later service that would be tied with Apple Pay, Bloomberg News reported in July. Afterpay shares fell 10 per cent the day following the report.</p>\n\n<p>Afterpay shareholders may reject the proposed Square offer, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Matt Ingram and Regan Burrows wrote. They pointed out the offer is below the stock’s peak earlier this year and its growth is much faster than the U.S. company.</p>\n\n<p>Under the proposed agreement, Afterpay co-founders and co-CEOs Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar would join Square and help lead Afterpay’s merchant and consumer businesses as part of Square’s Seller and Cash App division.</p>\n\n<p>The acquisition would be easily the biggest deal for an Australian company, eclipsing the US$16.6 billion a group of pension funds last month bid for Sydney Airport, only to have the offer rejected as too low.\nSquare recently launched its banking operations, including checking and savings accounts for small businesses, and offers loans. The addition of Afterpay also gives the digital payments company a chance to expand into consumer lending, which it doesn’t currently offer.</p>\n\n<p>‘Shared Purpose’</p>\n\n<p>“Square and Afterpay have a shared purpose,” Dorsey said in the statement. “We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles.”</p>\n\n<p>Square also reported second-quarter gross profit of US$1.14 billion, up 91 per cent year-over-year. Gross payment volume, or the total amount of payments processed on Square’s platform, increased 88 per cent to US$42.8 billion, the company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected US$36.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Square had been scheduled to release earnings Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>Total revenue, including Bitcoin, was US$4.68 billion. Bitcoin revenue alone was US$2.72 billion, below the US$3.4 billion estimate by analysts. Square said Bitcoin revenue declined because of “relative stability in the price of Bitcoin, which affected trading activity compared to prior quarters.”\nAfterpay was founded in 2015 and now has more than 1,300 employees globally, according to Molnar.</p>\n\n<p>The board of Melbourne-based Afterpay unanimously recommended shareholders accept the deal, which the company said is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/square-to-buy-afterpay-for-us-29-billion-to-tap-younger-users-1.1635504\">https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/square-to-buy-afterpay-for-us-29-billion-to-tap-younger-users-1.1635504</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/owl62e/square_acquires_afterpay_for_29b/","title":"Square acquires Afterpay for $29B","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-02T21:58:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-02 21:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"04087cf6-819e-595c-9045-8ca2be7d9989","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owl62e/square_acquires_afterpay_for_29b/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owl62e/square_acquires_afterpay_for_29b/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"stocks-to-crypto","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/stocks-to-crypto","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"stocks-to-crypto","score":557,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SquareがAfterpayを29Bドルで買収","the_new_excerpt":"スクエア、Afterpayを290億円で買収し、若年層ユーザーを獲得へ\n\nTwitter Inc.の創業者であるジャック・ドーシーが率いるデジタル決済プラットフォームのSquare Inc.\nDorseyが率いるSquare Inc.は、オーストラリアのAfterpay Ltd.を290億米ドルで買収することに合意しました。\n史上最大の買収額は290億米ドルです。\n\nAfterpay社は、全株式を取得することで...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Square以290亿美元收购Afterpay公司","the_new_excerpt":"Square公司将以290亿美元收购Afterpay，以开发年轻用户\n\n由Twitter公司创始人Jack Dorsey领导的数字支付平台Square Inc.\n多尔西同意以290亿美元收购澳大利亚现购现付公司Afterpay Ltd.\n以290亿美元的价格收购澳大利亚现购自运公司Afterpay Ltd.，这是该公司有史以来最大的一次收购。\n\n全股票报价对Afterpay公司的价值是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Square以290億美元收購Afterpay公司","the_new_excerpt":"Square公司將以290億美元收購Afterpay，以開發年輕用戶\n\n由Twitter公司創始人Jack Dorsey領導的數字支付平臺Square Inc.\n多爾西同意以290億美元收購澳大利亞現購現付公司Afterpay Ltd.\n以290億美元的價格收購澳大利亞現購自運公司Afterpay Ltd.，這是該公司有史以來最大的一次收購。\n\n全股票報價對Afterpay公司的價值是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-123f9824-d818-506d-90d6-54348e141e15","excerpt":"I have large position in AMZN.
