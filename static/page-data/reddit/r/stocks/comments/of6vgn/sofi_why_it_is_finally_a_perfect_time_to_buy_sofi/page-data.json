Cramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). </p>\n\n<p>And with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to SPIN on in the Future (similar to EBay &amp; Paypal)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...</p>\n\n<p>they also have Galileo for the platform/\nSoftware fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting... Anthony Noto as CEO.. CFO came from Uber... person in charge of Galileo from Google,etc.</p>\n\n<p>*<em>Overview of Business *</em></p>\n\n<p>SoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a\nnational bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will\nallow SOFI to take direct deposits &amp; make\nloans based on those deposits, rather than\nacting as a re-seller.</p>\n\n<p>Sofi also offers Credit Cards &amp; recently\nannounced it deal to offer auto loans. Also,\ntheres SoFi brokerage, which competes with\nRobinhood.</p>\n\n<p>Then add to the mix, Galileo, a payments\nprocessor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for\n$1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-\nService (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers\nbanking platform for over 90% of all digital\nbanks in North America. Over 70% of Top100\nFintechs globally are clients- including Chime\nand Robinhood.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CEO Anthony Noto</strong></p>\n\n<p>All the deals are similar. SoFi is buying\ncapabilities from small players it can roll into a\nfull-service bank-and-brokerage offering for a\nnational audience, running off a mobile app.\nSoFi is the ultimate expression of this\nchange and, in Anthony Noto, it has a leader\nwho can drive that change home.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s the jockey who matters on a horse\nlike this.&quot; Noto is a former Goldman Sachs\nbanker who helped take Twitter public and\nserved as CEO. He&#39;s also a former chief\nfinancial officer for the National Football\nLeague, one reason the SoFi name is on the\nnew Los Angeles Rams stadium.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If Noto continues to run SoFi, | think it&#39;s\nin good hands.&quot; He&#39;s a West Point graduate\nwhose business degrees come from the\nUniversity of Chicago and Wharton School of\nBusiness. He&#39;s still just 52. He could become\nhis generation&#39;s Jamie Dimon, who also got to\nthe top after a flurry of deal-making with\nCiticorp and Bank One.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/of6vgn/sofi_why_it_is_finally_a_perfect_time_to_buy_sofi/","title":"SOFI - Why it is finally a perfect time to buy SOFI","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-07T03:54:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-07 03:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"177b6b39-c551-59f4-8187-461c2f481071","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/of6vgn/sofi_why_it_is_finally_a_perfect_time_to_buy_sofi/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/of6vgn/sofi_why_it_is_finally_a_perfect_time_to_buy_sofi/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"SCModerate","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SCModerate","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SCModerate","score":106,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SOFI - いよいよ絶好の買い時を迎えた理由","the_new_excerpt":"SOFIは今日、17.30ドル付近で底を打ったようです...そしてPIPEの売り手が尽きたことで\nはもっと上に行く準備ができています。クレーマーはSoFIを合併後のSPACの中で今買うべきものの一つとして挙げています。\nクレーマーは、合併後のSPACの中で今買うべきものの一つとしてSoFIを挙げています。SOFIはアナリストの間ではすべて買いの評価で、当初の目標価格は30ドル。\n最初の目標価格は30ドルです。SoFIはまた、最も高い空売り率を誇っています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"SOFI - 为什么现在终于是购买SOFI的最佳时机？","the_new_excerpt":"今天SOFI似乎已经在17.30美元左右触底......随着PIPE卖家的用尽\n已经用尽了，准备好向更高的方向发展。Cramer刚刚将SoFI列为合并后SPAC中的一个\n合并后的SPACs，现在可以买入。SOFI获得了所有分析师的买入评级--最初的目标价是30美元。\n最初的目标价格为30美元。SoFI也有一个最高的空头。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"SOFI - 爲什麼現在終於是購買SOFI的最佳時機？","the_new_excerpt":"今天SOFI似乎已經在17.30美元左右觸底......隨着PIPE賣家的用盡\n已經用盡了，準備好向更高的方向發展。Cramer剛剛將SoFI列爲合併後SPAC中的一個\n合併後的SPACs，現在可以買入。SOFI獲得了所有分析師的買入評級--最初的目標價是30美元。\n最初的目標價格爲30美元。SoFI也有一個最高的空頭。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1412504087812268035","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1412504087812268035","title":"LOL -- pussies https://t.co/jGSvSSXo3g","date":"July 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"LOL -- pussies https://t.co/jGSvSSXo3g","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"大笑 -- 娘娘腔https://t.co/jGSvSSXo3g","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"大笑 -- 娘娘腔https://t.co/jGSvSSXo3g","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-415d817e-047c-59a4-8d3a-d351f22697d7","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 6, 2021\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high,\ndriven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks.
