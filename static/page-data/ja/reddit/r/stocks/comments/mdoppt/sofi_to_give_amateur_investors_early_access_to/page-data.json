Retail traders don’t have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.</p>\n\n<p>“Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn’t have before,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. “It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.</p>\n\n<p>SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It’s common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don’t typically offer them to the everyday investor. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/sofi-to-give-amateur-investors-early-access-to-ipos-in-break-from-wall-street-tradition-.html\">Source</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mdoppt/sofi_to_give_amateur_investors_early_access_to/","title":"SoFi to give amateur investors early access to IPOs in break from Wall Street tradition","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-26T16:09:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-26 16:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"72c978ee-ebf9-5497-9578-abd009428697","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdoppt/sofi_to_give_amateur_investors_early_access_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdoppt/sofi_to_give_amateur_investors_early_access_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"kayaarr","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kayaarr","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"kayaarr","score":193,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SoFi打破华尔街传统，让业余投资者提前进入IPO市场","the_new_excerpt":"在线金融初创公司SoFi（$IPOE）正在降低淘客门槛\n投资者在公司上市时购买其股票。\n\n这些IPO股票历史上一直是为华尔街的\n机构投资者或高净值个人。散户交易者没有\n买进的方式...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"SoFi打破華爾街傳統，讓業餘投資者提前進入IPO市場","the_new_excerpt":"在線金融初創公司SoFi（$IPOE）正在降低淘客門檻\n投資者在公司上市時購買其股票。\n\n這些IPO股票歷史上一直是爲華爾街的\n機構投資者或高淨值個人。散戶交易者沒有\n買進的方式...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c93d9084-a1c6-5a91-8a15-b0bad8118cd2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdoneu/stupid_fucking_automod_i_didnt_make_this_for_you/","title":"Stupid fucking automod I didn't make this for you to tell me you've seen it before.
