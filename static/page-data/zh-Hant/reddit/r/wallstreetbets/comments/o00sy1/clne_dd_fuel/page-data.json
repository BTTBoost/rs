Clean Energy has sound fundamentals as well as the retail trading hype that gives this stock <strong>🚀EXPLOSIVE🚀</strong> potential in short and long term time frames that entices both ape and boomer alike.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/acb7exedmb571.png?width=1818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0af1535a45cedd3ad206e0a0b4129050f333b660\">CLNE is the largest provider of RNG energy, the most eco friendly alternative fuel.🚀</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Green Energy is a fast growing industry that has attracted 🚀<strong>TRILLIONS🚀</strong> in investments from the international community, firms such as JP Morgan, and us, the common ape. CLNE itself has managed to attract deals and investments from big players recently, most notably Amazon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Not only is this a feel good trade, putting money into companies to make the world a cleaner and more sustainable place, but it also helps us make a quick buck too.</p>\n\n<h1>Financial Statement Analysis</h1>\n\n<p>More on the company itself, a quick look at its financial statements shows us that for 4 years+, CLNE has consistently brought down costs (from about 312m to 230m) to help improve its profit margins. This has also helped it greatly increase their free cash flow, from -41 mil in 2017 to +41 mil in 2020 (for you apes out there, free cash flow is the main indicator of a company&#39;s health, and growth like this is what attracts the big boys 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.) These improvements put CLNE in a good position to take <strong>full advantage</strong> of the growth of the renewable energy space.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<h1>Comparable Companies</h1>\n\n<p>I would like to give you an idea of the potential in this play by comparing CLNE to other popular clean energy plays that we&#39;ve seen pop recently and why CLNE is better (please note these shouldn&#39;t be taken as direct comparisons.)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o1brevrgmb571.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7563c815299bb67903cce221e17bb440ef74a7b\">As you can see, CLNE is best or second best (only to TSLA) in these key statistics🚀</a></p>\n\n<p>In comparison to PLUG, which famously rose from ~$4 in April 2020 to ~$75 in late January 2021, CLNE not only suggests better value from the statistics listed above, but PLUG has failed to reduce costs and increase cash flow the way CLNE has been able to. (PLUG&#39;s free cash flow declined from -104.5 mil in 2017 to -205.7m in 2020. PLUG operating costs have also gone up from 131 mil in 2017 to 376 mil in 2020)</p>\n\n<p>CHPT, which rose from ~$10 in August 2020 to ~$40 in December 2020, has only released 1 quarter of public financial statements. It is worth noting that their free cash flow is -42 mil for Q12021 while CLNE cash flow declined by only 71 thousand for the quarter. CLNE also show better value when comparing the statistics listed above.</p>\n\n<p>I included Tesla for the hell of it, and what&#39;s interesting is that Tesla has also struggled to reduce costs, and in many ways CLNE is trading at a discount when you compare some of the key stats I mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, FCEL, like many of the other popular clean energy names we&#39;ve seen here, has also failed to reduce costs and increase cash flow the same way CLNE has been able to, and again they are trading at a higher valuation in comparison to CLNE based on the statistics mentioned above.</p>\n\n<h1>Analyst and WSB Sentiment</h1>\n\n<p>For the factors mentioned above, it is no wonder why CLNE has been shown the love its been getting. About 2/3 of analyst list the stock as a &quot;buy&quot;, with price targets ranging anywhere from $11 (around where its currently trading) to $27. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>There is the potential for a huge short-term catalyst on 6/18, that will lead to parabolic price jumps should the stock close above $13, putting a shit load of options ITM and forcing a huge amount of buying. Options market also appears to be very bullish on CLNE, with a Put/Call ratio of .12 in today&#39;s trading (anything below .5 is considered bullish, so this is mega bull 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀) Couple this with the reasons stated above, it is very easy to see why this stock has received so much love for its short and long term potential🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p><strong>MR CLNE MR CLNE 🚀💨🐄⛽</strong></p>\n\n<h1>Positions- CLNE 12c 6/18</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00sy1/clne_dd_fuel/","title":"CLNE DD 🐄💨=🚀Fuel","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"June 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-15T20:45:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-15 20:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"96d9809b-e213-56d8-88d9-bbb6fb0bc631","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00sy1/clne_dd_fuel/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00sy1/clne_dd_fuel/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"420No_Ragrets69","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/420No_Ragrets69","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"420No_Ragrets69","score":1018,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CLNE DD 🐄💨=🚀Fuel","the_new_excerpt":"概略図\n\nCLNEは、再生可能な天然ガス（RNG）の分野でNo.1の企業としての地位を確立している堅実な企業です。\n最も環境に優しく、信頼性が高く、費用対効果の高い再生可能エネルギーである再生可能天然ガス（RNG）のNo.\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 アメリカン・ガス・ファウンデーションが行った調査によると\nアメリカン・ガス・ファウンデーションの調査によると...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CLNE DD 🐄💨=🚀Fuel","the_new_excerpt":"综述\n\nCLNE是一家可靠的公司，它已经找到了自己的定位，成为可再生天然气（RNG）领域的第一大公司。\n可再生天然气（RNG）是快速发展的绿色能源行业中最环保、最可靠、最经济的可再生能源。\n在快速发展的绿色能源行业中，可再生天然气是最环保、最可靠、最经济的可再生能源。🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀。\n美国天然气基金会进行的研究...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CLNE DD 🐄💨=🚀Fuel","the_new_excerpt":"綜述\n\nCLNE是一家可靠的公司，它已經找到了自己的定位，成爲可再生天然氣（RNG）領域的第一大公司。\n可再生天然氣（RNG）是快速發展的綠色能源行業中最環保、最可靠、最經濟的可再生能源。\n在快速發展的綠色能源行業中，可再生天然氣是最環保、最可靠、最經濟的可再生能源。🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀。\n美國天然氣基金會進行的研究...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-75708fc3-3dc3-5087-9e48-f39906f9ff56","excerpt":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mz2ue8/grandparents_left_me_disney_stock_but_never_told/\n\nI figured someone might be interested in this so I thought I'd share.
