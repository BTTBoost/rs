&lt;p&gt;The company IMHO is so undervalued at this price and has much room to go up, HIMX had strong revenue and earnings growth in the last 4 quarters, but the stock price did not act accordingly, and I believe this growth will continue due to chip shortage, and the transformation in the global economy to electric cars, in 2030 most of the big cars brands are expected to stop producing diesel cars and produce only electric cars, this is regardless the already existed electric cars brands like Xpeng, Nio, Tesla etc. this will cause constant demand on chips and more production and revenue for HIMX and other semiconductor stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/u5g0jy7vvk281.png?width=485&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=12c95a4227644109ca4be596b4ce38d3a91b3ff1&quot;&gt;HIMX Revenue and Earnings over the last 4 quarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below a comparison between AMD and HIMX performance for the last 4 quarters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.HIMX Revenue growth ................  AMD Revenue growth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q4 2020 $276M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15%&lt;/strong&gt; ----- Q4 2020 $3.24B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q1 2021 $309M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt; ------ Q1 2021 $3.45B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +7%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q2 2021 $365M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +18%&lt;/strong&gt; ------- Q2 2021 $3.85B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q3 2021 $421M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15% -------&lt;/strong&gt; Q3 2021 $4.31B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;....................HIMX...........AMD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price to Earnings ............ 5.35 .................... 49.23&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price to Sales  ..................1.29  ....................12.76&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book value per share .....$4.17!! 🤯  ...........$5.89!! 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current ratio  ...................2.01 ...................... 2.24&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD is definitely bigger name than HIMX but I used this comparison just to show how HIMX is growing on the same pace as AMD, how it has healthy statistics, and how cheap its valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO HIMX is a solid play and a bargain at this price, the only thing that is holding back the stock price is the possible conflict between China and Taiwan, but if that happens, all the market will tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conservative prediction is that One year from now assuming normal market conditions HIMX price will be at least $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also 15% short interest add some spice to the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my last word is, see you on the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌙 🌙 🌙&lt;/p&gt;

The discovery of the variant resulted in one of the worst Black Friday trading sessions in recent memory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.98%, the S&amp;amp;P 500 index SPX, 1.62% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 2.08% all tumbling by at least 2%, but Ackman’s comments suggest that investors’ knee-jerk response may have been an overreaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond yields on Friday also fell as prices for government debt saw a rush to the perceived safety of Treasurys on the back of fresh concerns about new restrictions that could result from a strain of COVID that the World Health Organization on Friday designated a variant of concern. However, stocks were bouncing back on Monday and the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.528% was up 8 basis points at 1.56%. Prices for Treasurys fall as yields rise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, is known for his lucrative COVID wager. The Financial Times reported back in 2020 that the investor cashed out on bet that netted him a $2.6 billion profit on a $27 million at risk, on the premise that insurance premiums would soar during the height of the 2020 COVID pandemic as economies locked down. He also later in 2020 said that he placed bearish bets on corporate credit on the day that Pfizer PFE, -0.64%  and BioNTech BNTX, 3.65% released positive trial data on their COVID-19 vaccine, which triggered a whipsaw rally in stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ackman was wagering that the vaccines would lead to mask-wearing complacency. However, that bet presumably turned out wrong as markets continued to surge in the aftermath of those vaccines. The danger posed by the omicron variant isn’t yet fully understood, even though governments in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas immediately restricted travel from southern Africa. Vaccine manufacturers have said that they are examining the variant closely and note that the current batch of remedies might still prove effective against the strain and new vaccines could be readied in early 2022 if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Take bigger risks when you are young. When you are in your 20’s its fine to go heavy in high risk/high reward stocks. But this is flawed reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is taking big risks when you are young is more risky because of opportunity costs. People always mention compounding interest over decades. But fail to apply this to investing in risky stocks when you are young. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say you are 20 years old and you have $10k to invest. Its common to hear people say you can be more risky since you are so young. And even if you do YOLO and lose it all you can easily recover. But think opportunity cost. What did you really lose doing a YOLO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$10,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invest in an index fund that returns 8.5% annualized return &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Withdraw at 65 years old&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That $10k becomes $400k. So you basically lost $400k because you YOLOed on a risky stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hold till 70 you lost $600k. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 90 you can give your children and grandchildren $3.2 million. Or you could have fun and lose it all on a risky stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is a young persons greatest asset is TIME. Throwing investment time away by taking unnecessary risk is a massive mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying don’t buy stocks that are risky hyper growth companies. But also don’t gamble needlessly. Because you are gambling much more than that couple hundred or thousand you see next to the stock ticker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Clark, Amazon’s CEO of worldwide consumer, told CNBC on Monday that the company is on track to become the nation’s largest delivery service by the end of 2021 or early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts have long predicted Amazon would overtake carriers like UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service, thanks to its increasingly in-house network of planes, trucks, vans and ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a positive development as Amazon dependence on other carriers will be lessen. The logistic and warehouse networks are in a optimal mode now as Amazon has been invested heavily to fight off the competition. This proves that the investment cycle has finally paid off as patience investors will be holding the amazon stocks and waiting for the next stock appreciation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sofi &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own Tesla because.... It is Tesla. People in my honest opinion want to believe they will only be making vehicles in the future. Not the case if Elon Musk gets his way (check out the Tesla bot for example, not to mention space travel, etc). Before today held 2 shares of Tesla, plan on buying 2 more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is a good long term buy and hold because it is Apple of course. I do not believe the Apple car that should be releasing in the next 3 years has been priced in to the stock at all yet. I could see Apple being worth over $500/share say 3 years from now. Before today held 14 shares of Apple, plan on buying 10 more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sofi is an underdog stock. I could see this stock going much further down, possibly to/below $10 a share again. Sofi is by definition loosing money, and it is the outlier compared to say a Tesla or an Apple stock... However I see it as being revolutionary when it comes to financial products for the everyday person. As a millennial most of my friends from around the United States seem to know more about Sofi than Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, etc. I would be shocked if Sofi is not worth $40 a share this time next year. Before today held 48 shares, will be buying 25 more today, and will wait for a potential dip below $12 - if that happens will buy as many shares as I can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me if I am missing anything with these stocks, and for us readers in similar situations, maybe a few stocks to consider purchasing in lieu of any of the above 3?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO and Coronavirus experts around the world are calling this morning for countries to drop travel restrictions and end the mass hysteria and instead be cautiously optimistic as initial reports out of South Africa suggest the new Omicron variant is not more lethal than the previous Delta variant. In fact, there have been no reports of hospitalisations or deaths as a result of anyone being diagnosed with Omicron. Most patients merely experience a severe headache, nausea, dizziness and a high pulse rate, according to hospitals and medics across Southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the news of the new variant, first reported in South Africa, led to mass hysteria around the world: markets thumbed and dozens of countries imposed travel restrictions and additional checks, including the UK, US, EU, Israel, Australia and Japan after the new mutation popped up in the UK, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic and Israel among other countries. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said this reaction was “medically seen, not justified.” A GP for over three decades, and chair of the South African Medical Association, she was the first African doctor to suggest to local authorities Covid had mutated into a new strain. Coetzee called the response from many European countries, including the UK, “just a hype.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s health minister Joe Phaahla also said the majority of cases of Omicron seen by doctors in his country have been “mild”. He added he has heard from GPs that the “majority of the people they’ve been seeing are mild.” “Our clinicians have not witnessed severe illness. Part of it may be because the majority of those who are positive are young people,” Dr Paahla added.&lt;/p&gt;

In my opinion, the biggest hurdle to the company&amp;#39;s trading performance is due to the Canadian adult recreational industry wide challenge along with covid-related retail headwinds. There&amp;#39;s been struggles for the Canadian cannabis LPs to generate growth organically within the adult recreational segment. For example, while Tilray, market leader in Canadian adult recreational, generated 26% topline growth from $405 million in 2020 to $513 million in 2021, much of that topline growth is derived from acquisitions. In other words, Tilray&amp;#39;s recent revenue growth were &amp;quot;bought&amp;quot; instead of generated organically as the market expands. Low growth within the segment along with some structural challenges and covid-related shut-downs further negatively impacted the industry&amp;#39;s outlook and profitability, resulting in depressing trading performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cannabis companies remain illegal in the United States at a federal level and debt capital raising are off the table as a result, Canadian cannabis LPs relies on equity issuance to fund acquisition opportunities to &amp;quot;grow&amp;quot; their toplines. Result of both stagnant growth and share dilution, Tilray traded down from $40 in February 2021 to $10 last close. Tilray&amp;#39;s TTM EV/Sales declined from 40x to 10x. For a growth company within a quickly expanding market that&amp;#39;s only 3 years old, 10x TTM sales EV is a good price in my opinion. What makes it even more attractive is that there&amp;#39;s a catalyst that the market has dismissed and forgotten that will completely derail the stagnant market growth narrative for Tilray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany&amp;#39;s new coalition government has recently reached a deal that&amp;#39;s set to legalize recreational cannabis use. As a result, German pot stocks popped last week on Frankfurt exchange. For example, German cannabis company Synbiotic rose by 33% to $29 Euro, which implies a $100mm market cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the market has forgotten however is that Canadian cannabis LP Tilray is actually the market leader in the Germany&amp;#39;s cannabis market. But the stock didn&amp;#39;t move last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I know the market made a mistake instead of &amp;quot;everything has been priced in&amp;quot; narrative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy. First, almost every German pot companies moved up last week. The fact that Tilray didn&amp;#39;t change at all suggests that whoever was making market genuinely forgot that Tilray is a market leader in the German cannabis market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if we assume status quo on Tilray&amp;#39;s 10x EV/Sales multiple, which is a very conservative assumption because we&amp;#39;re completely dismissing the potential of a new, 3-days old, 83 million population addressable market. And if we proxy $90 million of additional revenue, which is another very conservative assumption as Tilray generated $90 million in revenue after Canada legalized their adult recreational cannabis market in 2018; Conservative because German population doubles of Canadian. With the conservative multiple assumption while holding other variables constant, just by adding the additional $90 million in revenue, we should expect Tilray trade up by at least 30%. The fact that it didn&amp;#39;t trade up at the slightest suggests whoever was making market was sleeping in his office after he had his turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Tilray is production and distribution ready. Tilray operates two state-of-art facilities in Portugal and Germany with over 3 million square feet of production capacity. Tilray also owns and operates one of the largest market cap pharmaceutical company, CC Pharma, in Germany. Because of the company&amp;#39;s production and distribution capacity, institutional support, larger balance sheet, domestic moms &amp;amp; pops cannabis producers in Germany aren&amp;#39;t like to able to compete against Tilray in the immediate 24 months of legalization, allowing Tilray to secure market leadership. Again, this echoes with why assume only $90 million of revenue and 10x EV/Sales is a very conservative estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forth, there has been consistencies showing that the cannabis MTM is very inefficient. Most of you are aware that there were a squeeze with the Canadian cannabis LPs that took place in February. It was driven by Democrats winning the election, investors bet in favour that recreational cannabis use will be legalized in the U.S. It was similar to what&amp;#39;s happening today; similar but different. What&amp;#39;s similar is that both are political driven catalyst and market has gotten it completely wrong. Different was that last time Tilray were traded up for the wrong reason, Tilray has minimal operations in the United States, while they&amp;#39;re already a market leader in the German cannabis market with operations and infrastructures that are unmatched by their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, let me know if I got it wrong. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Position: 500 shares long TLRY at C$13.32&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks are most likely to be accepted as prudent at the moment they are not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only invest what you could afford to lose without that loss having any effect on your daily life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t overestimate the skill and wisdom of professionals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take advantage of what you already know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for opportunities that haven&amp;#39;t been discovered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in a home first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in companies, not the stock market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore short term movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting the economy is futile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting the short term movement of the stock market is futile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long term stocks have outperformed bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average person is exposed to local companies years before wall street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the stock market, one in the hand is worth 10 in the bush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Any idiot can run this business&amp;quot; is one characteristic of the perfect company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in companies that make products people need to keep buying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the company insiders are buying, you should too. Management normally sells 2.3 shares for every 1 share they buy. In 1987 after the crash, it was 4 buys for 1 sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry, any stock being touted as the next X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A share of stock is NOT a lotto ticket. It is a part ownership of a business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E ratio can be thought of as the number of years to earn back your original investment. IE = P/E of 10 would be 10 years assuming earnings stay constant. Ratios tend to be lower for slow growers and highest for the fast growers with cyclicals in between depending on the current cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at average P/E ratios on the company you are researching and peers going back several years to determine if it is a good buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid stocks with HIGH P/E ratios. They must have incredible earnings growth to justify the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E ratio that is half the growth rate (annual earnings) is very positive and one that is twice the growth rate is very negative. IE = P/E of 10 should be growing at 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formula = Growth rate plus dividend yield divided by P/E. IE = 12% growth + 3% yield/10 P/E = 1.5. Less than 1 is bad. 1.5 is ok and 2+ is great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market as a whole has its own collective P/E ratio, which is a good indicator of weather the market at large is over or under valued. If some stocks are selling at inflated prices relative to earnings, then it could be likely most stocks are selling at inflated prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rates have a large effect on p/e ratios as investors pay higher p/e when interest rates are lower and bonds less attractive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend paying stocks keep the stock price from falling as far as if there was no dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You CAN&amp;#39;T predict future earnings. Wall Street has battalions of analysts trying to do this and they are wrong a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Flow – amount of money a company takes in as a result of doing business. You want to buy companies that don&amp;#39;t need to spend a lot of money to make money IE = company spends 20 million to make 100 million is better than one that needs to spend 90 million to make 100 million. Formula = $20 stock with $2 per share annual cash flow has a 10-1 ratio which is standard (10%). $20 stock with $4 CF = 20% return on cash. Focus on free cash flow – what is left over after normal capital spending is taken out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt to equity ratio - normal is 25% debt to 75% equity but higher equity % is better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

In FY21&amp;#39; Costco did $192 Billion in sales from their 815 warehouses globally. Additionally, 61.7 million households have active Costco memberships, bringing Costco another $3.9 billion in membership fees alone, all with a 91.3% renewal rate. Let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at Costco from an investment standpoint.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco P/E Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco&amp;#39;s historical P/E hovers around 32x - 35x. Costco&amp;#39;s current P/E ratio sits around 48x which is decently high considering its&amp;#39; historical averages. The increase in Costco&amp;#39;s TTM and current P/E ratio is due to Costco&amp;#39;s stock price appreciating by 44%~ in the last six months alone. I expect Costco&amp;#39;s stock price to stabilize or fall slightly in 2022 as the P/E ratio returns to normal values as long as Costco&amp;#39;s earnings continue to grow. The recent Covid variant could affect Costco&amp;#39;s performance moving into 2022 if the areas where they operate return to lockdown, primarily US and Candian storefronts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco Free Cash Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco continues to increase their FCF with TTM values sitting around $6 billion. This is ~45% increase in FCF when compared to their 3Y FCF value around $4.2 billion. Costco&amp;#39;s ability to keep increasing free cash flow will ensure they can pay creditors and contributes to the safety of their dividend. Although not guaranteed, Costco has paid special dividend three out the last six years. This is a nice bonus to shareholders considering Costco&amp;#39;s yield is sub one percent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco Profit Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco has historically kept their profit margins right around 2%. The TTM value sits just below 2.5% which is strong indicator for Costco that customers are returning to stores post Covid. 2.5% may not seem like a high number but remember Costco generated around $192 billion in sales last year, meaning they produced a profit on that around $4.8 billion. Couple that with their membership fees as they have healthy sustainable margins.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco Dividend Yield &amp;amp; Dividend Yield on Cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco&amp;#39;s dividend yield, as of 26 November 2021, sits at .58% which is the lowest it&amp;#39;s been when compared to historical averages. Again, this is attributed to Costco&amp;#39;s stock price appreciation of ~44% over the last six months. This is another indicator that Costco shares may be overvalued and you should wait to invest. Costco currently pays $3.16 in dividends per share per year. Absent a dividend increase Costco&amp;#39;s price would need to drop to around $430 per share to realign its dividend with the 3Y average. It&amp;#39;s unlikely that Costco is going depreciate by 22% from its current $550 per share value. Costco&amp;#39;s Yield on Cost is where you as an investor can get your return on investment when it comes to building passive income. Costco has a high compound annual growth rate (CAGR) around 13% meaning if you had bought Costco 15 years ago your YOC would be above 6%! Considering Costco has routinely increased their dividend at a rate higher than average you can see your dividends increase quickly without having to invest more capital. This is one of the reasons I decided to invest in Costco. Costco has been increasing their dividends for the past 17 years and I expect that trend to continue as they move closer to joining the dividend aristocrat list.  Costco spends approximately $1.4B per year to maintain their dividend. This and the growth associated appears safe considering Costco&amp;#39;s ability to maintain and increase free cash flow and profit margins.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividend Payout Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Lastly, Costco&amp;#39;s dividend payout ratio sits around 27% with an average around 29-31%. This is significantly lower that most dividend companies including some long-standing dividend aristocrats. Costco is only paying around 30% of its earnings out as dividends meaning they have money available to continue funding further expansion in the future. Costco has strong track record of consistently increasing earnings YoY which contributes to their ability to maintain a stable dividend payout ratio. This will also ensure they are able to continue growing their dividend in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco is a great growth stock that also pays a dividends. Currently, however, Costco is overvalued. Looking at the current FIBs I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect the price to fall below the .786 FIB at $502. If you are looking to add to your position or start a new position I would wait for a pullback in December or early 2022. Costco is overvalued when you compare both Dividend Yield and P/E ratios with their historical values. I also expect Costco to raise their dividend in 2022 so getting in prior to the increase will help boost your yield on cost so you could always invest now if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re look for. I&amp;#39;ll be watching Costco&amp;#39;s price action over the next month or so to find a good entry point to expand my current position.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps everyone! Happy Investing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have open positions in Costco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming someone carrying Omicron antibodies is immune to the Delta strain, a new non lethal strain taking over the world and replacing Delta would be the ideal way to end this pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging Omicron to spread is going to spread delta-immunity across the 3rd world much faster than vaccines ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we won’t really know for a couple of weeks just how deadly this strain is, but if early reports are true and it does turn out to be non-lethal this could be massive for the world and of course markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Anything else is speculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculators attitude toward stock market movements lies in trying to anticipate and profit from market fluctuations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investor&amp;#39;s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unintelligent speculation is speculation when you think you are investing, any trades done on margin, doing it seriously instead of a pastime, risking more than you can afford to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are going to speculate, put a small amount aside and don&amp;#39;t add money because you are up. Understand that you in fact are speculating and be prepared to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying IPOs or &amp;quot;Hot&amp;quot; stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defensive Investor – Interested in safety and freedom from bother. Purchase investment funds vs creating a stock portfolio, use investment counsel firm, or dollar-cost average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggressive Investor – To enjoy a reasonable chance of success, the investor must follow policies which are sound and promising and are NOT popular on Wall Street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must be either a defensive/conservative investor or an aggressive/enterprising investor. You can&amp;#39;t be 50/50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculative stock movements are carried too far in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Savings Accounts can also be a good choice in lieu of bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT buy on margin. You are speculating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the investors funds are placed into high grade short maturity bonds (&amp;amp;lt;7 years), he will not be affected by market prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer term bonds and equities will vary during his lifetime and he must be prepared for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment of most intelligent when it is most businesslike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defensive Investor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred Stocks are not usually a good investment. It carries no share in the company&amp;#39;s profits beyond a fixed dividend. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal claim of a bondholder (Creditor) and the profit possibilities of a common stockholder (Partner). You are dependent on the ability and desire of the company to pay dividends on its common stock. They are under no obligation to pay you unless they pay the common shareholder. This investment vehicle is better for corporations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The choice of a corporate bond vs tax free municipal bond is made by the tax rate payed by the individual. Example – If a municipal pays 30% less than a corporate bond. The investor was at a tax bracket above 30% he would have a net saving by choosing the municipal bond. The opposite is true if the tax was below 30%. Usually tax-free bonds are better for individuals in high tax brackets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only invest in high quality bonds – AAA, AA, A. Do NOT invest in lower quality (2nd grade) issues to get a higher return. Stay away from high yield &amp;quot;Junk Bonds&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules for Defensive Common Stock Component – A. Adequate diversification but not excessive B. Company should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed C. Long record of dividend payments D. Have a limit on the price willing to pay. Say 25x average earnings over the last 7 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defensive investors should usually stay away from Growth Stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the most persuasive test of high quality is uninterrupted record of dividend payments for the last 20 years or more. The defensive investor might be justified in limiting his purchases to those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock Selection – Adequate size, strong financial condition (Current ratio 2/1), positive earnings for the past 10 years, uninterrupted dividends for the past 20 years, EPS growth of at least 33% in the past 10 years, P/E of less than 15 for the last 3 years earnings, current price not more than 1.5x book value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short vs Long Maturity Bonds – if the investor wants to assure himself against a decline in the principal of his bond but at the cost of a lower annual yield and loss of possibility of a gain in principal, pick short maturity bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might be best for the conservative investor to concentrate on issues selling at a close approx. to their tangible asset value (book value). Say not more than 1/3 above that figure. Consider this a premium an extra fee paid for the advantage of a stock exchange listing and ability to quickly sell/buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But just because a stock is selling for its book value doesn&amp;#39;t make it a good investment. The investor should demand a satisfactory P/E ratio, strong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk of paying too high a price for good quality issues is not the chief hazard confronting the average invest. Observation is that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low quality issues at times of favorable business conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggressive Investor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth Stock – one which has increased their per share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common stocks and is generally expected to continue to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth stocks have 2 problems – Growth stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell at correspondingly high prices. The investor maybe right in his judgement of the prospects and still not do well. Merely because he overpaid for the expected prosperity. The 2nd is his judgment as the future may prove wrong. Rapid growth can&amp;#39;t last forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from IPO&amp;#39;s/Common stock offerings. They tend to be offered in &amp;quot;favorable&amp;quot; market conditions for the sellers, not the buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The habit of the market is to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth, but it will also undervalue companies that are out of favor because unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If looking at growth companies, concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a period of unpopularity. Smaller companies don&amp;#39;t have the resources to withstand the storm and the market is slower to react to improvement vs larger companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 major sources of undervaluation. A. currently disappointing results and B. unpopularity. But make sure these are temporary and not permanent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The investor should require an indication of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past decade. No years of earnings deficit plus size and strength to meet possible setbacks. The ideal combination here is that of a large and prominent company selling both well below its past average price and its past average P/E ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary Company – one that is not a leader in a fairly important industry. They tend to be undervalued at all times. Buy them only when they are at &amp;quot;Bargain&amp;quot; prices. Bargain being a stock that has an indicated value 50% above the share price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways to profit from secondary buys. A. The dividends are relatively high. B. The reinvested earnings are high relative to price paid and will affect the price. C. A bull market is most generous to lower priced issues. D. Smaller companies may be acquired by larger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broadest category of investments for the enterprising investor are undervalued stocks of secondary issues. Invest in these only when they can be bought at 2/3 or less of indicated value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market Fluctuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 ways to profit from pendulum swings in the market A. Timing – anticipate the direction of the market and buy/sell accordingly (Very Difficult to do). B. Pricing – buying or selling when the stock are quoted above or below fair value. You may do dollar cost averaging when the market is fair value or undervalued to replicate this strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A less ambitious form of pricing is the simple effort that you do not pay too much for your stocks. This may work for the defensive investor who is planning on holding long term. You can dollar cost average during fair or low value markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bull Market Signs – Historically high price levels, high P/E ratios, low dividend yields against bond yields, speculation on margin, lots of public offerings of low quality stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more successful a company, the more likely its price will fluctuate widely. Secondary issues will also fluctuate more widely than major ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell because it has gone down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speculators primary interest lie in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor&amp;#39;s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at good prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy-Low Sell High – very difficult to do, so instead increase the proportion of bonds in your portfolio during bull markets and reduce the common stock element. Say 75B/25S during bull markets and 25B/75S during bear and 50/50 during fair value. This allows the investor to feel as if they are doing something and to prevent you from following the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite landing in the top berth of the weekend’s top 10 and scoring the best opening weekend numbers for an animated feature in the pandemic era, the five-day gross for “Encanto” was considerably lower than the box office takes for earlier Disney animated films that opened over the Thanksgiving period, including “Frozen II” in 2019 ($123.7 million), “Ralph Breaks the Internet” in 2018 ($84.6 million) and “Coco” in 2017 ($71 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, “Encanto” had strong competition from last week’s box office champ, Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” which finished in a close second place behind the Disney film with $35.2 million from 4,315 theaters during the five-day haul. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your moved for tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Not to be biased whatsoever, but I personally believe that after delta’s variant scare, I believe that pharmaceuticals and government officials are better prepared to research the virus and assign its concern accordingly; whether it be creating a whole new vaccine (very, very unlikely) or safety measures (vaccine/booster mandates, social distancing, hospital beds, etc). In addition, I believe that it has been proven that the tech sector in particular has shown great resistance to virus. From learning from past events, investors, like myself, are going to be less weary of the dips and expand holdings into strong companies like AMD, Microsoft, Apple, etc. Idk how reliable futures are but they’ve shown to be very bullish for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must know your time horizon for investments

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Term Investments – 1 year or less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermediate Term Investments – 2-5 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long Term Investments – 5 plus years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the investment Liquid(stocks) or Illiquid (Real Estate)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t buy preferred shares or convertible shares of stock. They have tax advantages that individual investors can&amp;#39;t get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivative assets(futures) - derive their value from an underlying security or something else (very speculative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks – you are the owner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonds – you are the bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short term securities – cash = principal is safe. Inflation risk still exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutual Funds – managed on your behalf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks have historically done better than bonds but move up and down more (Do you want to eat well or do you want to sleep well?)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks have a greater distribution range than bonds. IE – they up 30% one year and down 10% the next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment returns over time tend to mirror a normal distribution or &amp;quot;bell curve&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The greater the standard deviation, the wider the distribution of returns and the risker the investment. Stocks have wider distribution and more risk than bonds. But long term they provide a higher average return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t chase the next big thing. You will lose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t speculate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT invest in an annuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short Term Investments - Cash

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 year or less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually Guaranteed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very liquid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Risk-Low Return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good place for emergency fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can lose purchasing power if they don&amp;#39;t keep up with inflation. Which they sometimes don&amp;#39;t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Savings accounts – stated rate of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series EE savings bonds - Discount method – buy for $50 and redeem for $100 later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series I savings bonds – indexed to inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasury Bills – 1, 3 or 6-month maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate of Deposit (CD) – have to be on deposit for a certain amount of time. From days to years. They usually rollover if you don&amp;#39;t stop them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money Market Mutual Fund – mutual fund that invests only in short term securities. Unlike savings, they are not federally guaranteed but are considered risk free because other companies will bail them out in a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutual Funds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a family, not a fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professional money management and diversification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DCA – Dollar cost average is a great way to invest in mutual funds. You don&amp;#39;t worry what the market is doing or where it is going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t try to time the market. DCA!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a long-term horizon and DCA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most mutual fund investors BUY HIGH and SELL LOW. Don&amp;#39;t do this. Do not bail out of stocks when the market is down and buy on the way up. Most mutual fund investors do worse than the funds they invest in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a fund family and stick with them. Re-evaluate your investments once a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PITA (Pain in the A**) factor is low&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management fee - Between 0.05% and 2% based on asset value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12b-1 – &amp;quot;Advertisement fee&amp;quot; usually under 1%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading Cost – not disclosed in the prospectus. Look at the fund turnover. Higher turnover = higher trading costs. Lower turnover = lower trading costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load – charge a commission when the fund is bought. Paid to the financial representative. Usually 3-5%

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A – front end load – paid upfront&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B – back end load – paid when shares are sold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deferred sales charge – ladder down then go to zero. 5,4,3,2,1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Load – no commission when the fund is bought

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No sales representative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12b-1 Fee can&amp;#39;t be over 0.25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I, F = don&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;load&amp;quot; but charge a &amp;quot;management fee&amp;quot; of usually 1-2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index funds are usually true no load funds – be careful because some 401K&amp;#39;s have index funds with very high fee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;REIT – Real Estate Investment Trust&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass through investments that must distribute 95% of earnings to shareholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own various forms of real estate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good long-term investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No PITA factor unlike being a landlord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very liquid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are a hedge against inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No management concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer diversification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow general public ownership in a business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historically the best return is in stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very liquid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primary Market – IPO&amp;#39;s – don&amp;#39;t get involved in this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary Market – where most investors trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from OTC (Over the Counter) markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bid (Sell) - Ask (Buy) – what they will buy or sell a security for. The market makers make the spread between the bid/ask and provide liquidity to the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t buy on margin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t sell short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dow Jones – price weighted index of 30 companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S+P 500 – market cap weighted index of 500 companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSCI and EAFE – index of foreign companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock spin off – conversion of a company&amp;#39;s subsidiaries into a standalone company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock split – increase in number of shares outstanding. IE 2 for 1. You had 100 shares at $10 but now you have 200 shares at $5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share buyback – company buys back their own shares and this increases the EPS because you have less shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks can have different classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A – original shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B, C, D, E, etc – companies can have different share classes that have different rights or benefits. IE – higher dividend, more votes, etc. look at what you are buying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want cash dividends, not stock dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valuation techniques&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental analysis of finance holds that the value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The worth of a company is primarily based on the earnings the company will produce in the future (difficult to predict)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most fundamental influence on stock prices is the level and duration of the future growth earnings and dividends. However, future earnings are dividends are NOT easily estimated even by professionals – Burton Malkiel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no single financial ratio(P/E) that can summarize the general state of affairs of the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E ratio – current price of a company divided by the earnings per share. Industries tend to have certain P/E ratios. Some tend to have higher or lower P/E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historically P/E was supposed to match its growth rate. IE – 20% growth rate = 20 P/E. But P/E have been 100+ at times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth stocks tend to have high P/E – must have very high earnings to justify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value stocks tend to have low P/E – doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it is a good buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The P/E ratio tells you how long to earn back your investment back. IE – P/E 10 takes 10 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price/Sales ratio (P/S) – same as P/E but you used sales instead of earnings. Usually used for fast growing companies who don&amp;#39;t have any earnings. Wall St. justified high prices on internet stocks during the late 90&amp;#39;s by using a P/S ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price/Book Ratio (P/B) – Book value is assets minus liabilities. P/B ratio is current price divided by book value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price Ratio Analysis - Expected stock price =

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-year average P/E or P/S or P/Cash Flow x Current EPS X (1 + EPS Growth Estimate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Price Ratio Analysis has not been very reliable analysis tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of a stock are valued on the basis of the present value of the future dividend streams the stock is projected to produce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This strategy worked very well during the 2001 downturn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value of a stock = present value of all future dividend payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present value – the value today of a lump sum to be received at some future date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different types of DDM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero Growth – assumes dividends will continue at a fixed rate indefinitely. Works well for stable income producing stocks

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take annual dividends and divide by required rate of return (you generate this number)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IE – Dividend of $3 a share and 6% required rate of return = $50 share value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero growth is another way to think about dividend yield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IE – Dividend divided by market price = rate of return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example – Utility stock pays a $2.86 dividend. Current price is $75. If we want an 8% return take 2.86/0.08 = $35.75 – stock is overvalued based on our expected 8% return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also flip the formula to get what the market thinks the return is going to be. Take the dividend/price. 2.86/75 = 3.81%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant perpetual growth model – assumes dividends will grow at a specified rate perpetuity into the future. Good for companies with consistent dividend growth

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example – dividend of $10 per share and a 5% dividend growth rate. Required rate of return = 15%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(10 x 1.05) / (15% - 5%) = 10.5 / 10% (0.1) = $105&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3M example - $230.37 per share. $5.44 dividend. Dividend growth 8%. Required rate of return 13%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(5.44 x 1.08) / (13 – 8) = 5.87 / 5% = $117.50 – overvalued based on example. But this formula is very susceptible to changes in required rate of return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The constant perpetual growth model is very sensitive to dividend growth and required return rates plugged into the formula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#39;t use DDM for a company that isn&amp;#39;t paying dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend growth rates are very difficult to estimate. Unless you are looking at large cap, well established companies. But for smaller, faster growing companies in new industries, it is almost impossible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDM – The value of a stock is based on the present value of its future cash flows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This strategy is good for prudent, long term investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value line investment survey is a good place to get your information. You can get this information at some library&amp;#39;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing all this math only tilts the odds in our favor. It doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee that it will work like we wanted. Ask yourself a simple question. Would I want to own this company if I had X dollars? That is the real question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no one financial ratio that tells you to buy or sell a stock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance Sheet

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial summary of firm&amp;#39;s assets, liabilities, and shareholders&amp;#39; equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assets – liabilities = shareholder equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current – Less than 1 year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long Term – More than 1 year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Income Statement

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial summary of the operating results for a specified period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue – expenses = income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Flow Statement

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial summary of the cash flow of the company and other events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reports

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10K – annual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10Q – quarterly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Ratios – remember there is no one ratio to consider

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E – Price/Earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most popular stock market ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price/EPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tells you how long in years it will take the company to earn back its price. P/E of 5 = 5 years to earn back your investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at competitor&amp;#39;s P/E ratio. Don&amp;#39;t just look at one number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The P/E ratio should approximately match the growth rate. PEG ratio of 1. Higher than 1 = P/E is higher than growth rate. Less than 1 = P/E is lower than growth rate. More than 1 is common now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend per share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend/Number of shares outstanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend Yield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend per share/market price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend payout ratio – how much of the earnings are being paid out in dividends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend per share/EPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shareholders equity/Number of shares outstanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It tells you the &amp;quot;liquid&amp;quot; value of the company if you sold off all the assets and paid off all the debts and paid off the shareholders. Many companies trade above book value because they are worth more intact than split up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price to book value per share – tells an investor how far above the market value is above the book value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;market price/book value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-4+ is not uncommon. IE – Book value of $5 and market value of $20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than 1 is bad because the company is in danger because raiders might try to take the company and sell off the assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price to cash flow and price to sales – don&amp;#39;t use these&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; companies without earnings. Many companies were valued with this during the internet boom of the late 90&amp;#39;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profitability ratio

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Profit Margin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate of profit earned after expenses and taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Varies based on industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Income/Total Revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross Profit Margin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate of profit earned from gross profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross Profit/Total Revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Margin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate of profit being earned from net income adjusting for non-cash items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Income/Total Revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The higher the better with the profitability ratios. But check your competitors and see what is the normal for your industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on assets (ROA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measures profitability relative to its total assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Income/Total Assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on equity (ROE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure of the overall profitability of a company in relation to shareholders equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Income/Total Stockholder equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on equity is sensitive to the amount of debt a company carries. If a company carries more debt, it will have a higher ROE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROA and ROE can be drastically different, especially if a company carries lots of debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquidly Ratios

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Assets/Current Liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current ratio of 1.0 or higher is good. It means you have enough money to fund your short-term obligations. Higher number is better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage Ratios

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt to equity ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term debt/Total stockholder equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A higher ratio means that the company is financing its growth with debt. The lower the number the better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sir Issac Newton – I can calculate the movement of the stars but not the madness of men&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maynard Keynes – The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From 1963-1998 the S+P 500 Index funds beat the active funds in 22 of the 36 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many mutual funds have high expenses and high turnover rates. They also have a short time horizon. This makes it hard for them to beat the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you hear – BE CAREFUL!!!

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s a new era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s different this time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old ways of valuing stocks are gone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham – the investing public is incorrigible. It will buy anything, at any price, if there seems to be some action in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mania&amp;#39;s will end with a crash every time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ben Graham – Be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Templeton – Bear markets are born of pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversification – spreading your investments across asset classes to eliminate some, but not all risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversification – guarantees that some investments will not do well any given year. You have to look at the whole portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash has not been the top performer vs stocks or bonds in the last 25 years.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in BABA eventually coming back to 300+ BUT i don&amp;#39;t think its going to come back fast enough to justify being capital locked for the number of years i would potentially have to wait to make the investment worthwhile. If i sold now i would have to take around 15k loss- it hurts but i hate looking at the position... especially on something i don&amp;#39;t believe in anymore. Anyone else in a similar situation?&lt;/p&gt;
