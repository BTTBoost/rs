Money is being thrown around like candy, this is completely unsustainable. But as the saying goes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Even burry was early by a year. It&amp;#39;s quite clear to me before the end of next year the bubble is going to pop, it&amp;#39;s just a matter of when not if.

She is one of the best money managers I know. For example she spent over a month researching which car to buy, and caught the car salesmen twice trying to sneak higher prices past her during negotiation. She is the perfect person I would expect to be a boglehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is currently sitting on $60k in cold hard cash, that she has been building up for over 3 years. I knew she must have some but I didn&amp;#39;t know it was this much. I introduced her to the bogleheads philosophy, sent her a link to The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, sent her a link to the bogleheads forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was about 6 months ago. I have tried to engage her since then, but she just does not seem interested in the topic. Which is even more infuriating because that&amp;#39;s exactly the type of person who should be investing in low cost index funds. Someone who literally doesn&amp;#39;t care and will only check it every 5 years or so. She said she is too scared to invest, too risk adverse. I tried to tell her (and her sisters) that in fact the riskier thing by far is to not invest. But I don&amp;#39;t seem to be getting through to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is still kind of young, so I think she thinks she still has time, but my analytical brain is on fire thinking of the compounding interest she is losing out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else faced this issue? How do I convince her what she is doing, while it may feel safe, is actually way more dangerous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: I should clarify that I am NOT trying to force Bogleheads philosophy on my sister-in-law. I&amp;#39;m not even really a Boglehead myself, although I do admire and desire to be a Boglehead. I have had maybe 3 conversations with her about investing, each less than 5 minutes long. This post is about my anxiety and concern for my family&amp;#39;s financial health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother became very ill when I was 20 years old, and was forced into early retirement. She didn&amp;#39;t have enough saved up by then to survive on her own. It has been very tough for me to witness, and I think my fears are coming out in anxiety when I see other people I love make decisions that might set them up for a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;

What the ever loving fuck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is going on here? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my theory, and I’ll preface this by saying I’m not a crypto expert, but I am the owner of a large PR firm, and I’ve seen the underbelly of how media works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s happening here is that we are witnessing the extraordinary power of meme based communities centered around highly memeable content. The power comes from two places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meme creates very strong in-group dynamics. Look no further than the popularity of meme based (not memecoin) based subreddits. Memes spread like wildfire even when financial incentive isn’t involved. This creates hyper active communities that build strong ties extremely quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memes themselves are viral loops. Any community user creating memes is a potential source of new virality for the meme, or memecoin. This is an exponential flywheel and this is what most miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these groups ramp up, you inevitably get people with media power joining, including journalist with big audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be happening with dogebonk and perhaps a few others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memecoin market is an insane Wild West, and everyone should fully expect them all to potentially be scams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we already know the proliferating power of memes, so to expect memecoins to not be able to leverage that huge power, is to be blind to the clown world crypto enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 years ago I had my wife set up a ISA (UK equivalent of ROTH IRA), she invested with a lumpsum and has been contributing a little under 10% of her salary to it each month since. Currently sitting on returns of just under 58%, she owns direct equities in 5 other companies (small values under £1000) with mixed fortunes. One small cap mining has performed well the others well below the rate of inflation and 1 has negative returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been encouraging her to sell (no tax implications) and reinvest into her vangaurd portfolio as a lumpum but she is emotionally attached to the success of her picks and does not want to sell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you kind folks send me some specific article and studies on passive strategy vs direct stocks? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to reason, explained compounded growth, opportunity loss but cannot get through to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich Millennials to Financial Advisers: Thanks for the Golf Invite, but You Can’t Invest My Money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WSJ recently wrote an article about it, you can easily find an article if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear the same again and again: &amp;quot;anyone can do a job of an average financial advisor&amp;quot;. Below is a story of a person from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a group of 5 mutual funds and our decision to decide what fund to put them in was based on one question: “on a scale of 1-5, what is your risk tolerance”. We asked every single client this and based on their answer plus their age, income and savings we put them in one of those  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought even a monkey could do my job at first but was amazed how many clients wouldn’t invest at all and just had their money sitting in cash. I wondered how even without an advisor why people couldn’t/wouldn’t pick pretty much any mutual fund and put their money there  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got paid based on how much I got people to invest and thought it would be easy money to convince people to make their assets grow but it was damn hard. Most clients had money in a CD and would refuse to move it &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought of going to money managers? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you tried - what was the experience like?&lt;/p&gt;

With their venemo amzn deal, Christmas around the corner, they should have a decent quarter. Just want to get some thoughts on say why even current price levels might be higher or essentially any other downsides. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

My gut feeling tells me that if everyone flocks to one thing, there must be something fishy about it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t lie, I&amp;#39;ve been tempted time and time again to jump in, seeing my friends make 10% in a single day and what not. I guess I am only human. However, after reading the works of Buffet, Howard Marks, Munger, and those gentlemen (which i consider my teachers), Tesla just seems to go against their philosophy; especially when it comes to the margin of safety principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Tesla is a special case, if we look at Tesla as a company, their debt is consistently decreasing, equity and profits are growing like crazy, all of that is good. It&amp;#39;s just the valuation. Currently at a P/E of ~300 for instance, it means they have A LOT to back up for in the near future and the public obviously has high hopes in them. But my question is, what exactly is this hope? I am not very informed about Tesla, neither am I an engineer, which is why I wanna hear some of your opinions about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- What is their specific moat when it comes to the electric cars? How will this moat be protected by other automobile dealers? (i.e the Germans, Ford, the Chinese, etc...) Is it just their brand or do they have superior technology that will actually be hard to replicate/improve by other companies in the coming 10 years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- What other ventures are they going into besides cars? Is it A.I? What constitutes as A.I? If it is a personal robot who does the dishes for you and cleans your house, in what way will they have superior engineers compared to the other giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft? And why will they perform better than them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, what is it that they do that makes people so confident in them, and what is it that accounts for this valuation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the articles states this which I thought was interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{Evergrande’s challenges could spread outside of China as well, as they ripple through global financial markets. On Monday, the Federal Reserve said troubles in China’s property sector could threaten the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through a deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States,” the Fed said in its twice-yearly update on the American financial system.} &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EVERGRANDE DID DEFAULT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/now/evergrande-officially-defaulted-dmsa-preparing-161200818.html&quot;&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/now/evergrande-officially-defaulted-dmsa-preparing-161200818.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am seriously concerned on the reasons why evergrande’s default is being silenced, and what this means for the market as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a stock goes up by a dollar or around 5%, they say dumb crap like, &amp;quot;this stock has surged today.&amp;quot; or ascended, or spiked, or is sky rocketing.

&lt;p&gt;like no, no it&amp;#39;s not. if I&amp;#39;m an investor from day one, and I read the phrase skyrocket, I&amp;#39;m thinking this thing is like $100 a share or something. Like the people who write these articles, I don&amp;#39;t know how they get paid for this. These analysts are paid to type nonsense every single day, but they aren&amp;#39;t paid to be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if there was some enforced rules to these fancy adjectives. Because i see it with every company. They say plummet, or downward spiral, or falling when a company goes down even 1%, but jettisoned, surged, or sky rocket when it&amp;#39;s doing mildly good. I think it&amp;#39;s meant to keep people nervous and excited so people keep buying and selling and eventually make no money in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks advanced firmly on Friday, with market participants continuing to balance better-than-expected corporate earnings amid rising inflation. The S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.75% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.05%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) broke a three day losing streak to finish 0.51% higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Friday’s close, the SPY closed the week 0.4% lower following volatility after the release of the October Consumer Price Index. However, after five consecutive weeks of gains, the market remains marginally below previous all-time highs. The QQQ closed the week 0.91% lower, while the DIA closed the week 0.97% lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a rise in inflation was expected, the pace of the increase surprised to the upside. If the pace of increase is not moderated soon, it carries meaningful implications for corporations, consumers, and the Federal Reserve. As input costs rise, companies will pass the increase in cost to consumers to preserve their bottom line, who will be forced to pay the higher prices. The Fed would then be forced to step in and rise interest rates, which will makes the cost to borrow money more expensive, which means people and companies will likely spend less, leading to a fall in demand for goods and services. A rise in interest rates would particularly hurt high P/E tech stocks that have been flying in the last two years, as these companies rely on borrowing to fund their aggressive expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the Federal Reserve and many economists have reaffirmed that the inflationary pressures are transitory, caused by pandemic-era disruptions in global trade and will eventually ease, albeit while likely settling at a higher level than had been present before the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabriela Santos, Global Market Strategist at JP Morgan, said “Inflation should moderate. We’re talking about settling at 2%, 2.5% over the course of the next 12 months. So we&amp;#39;re still talking about real wage gains, and that&amp;#39;s extremely supportive, certainly of people&amp;#39;s livelihoods, but also of consumption and hence the economy overall. We do expect a big re-acceleration in growth starting this quarter and throughout next year, [and] 5% average growth just over the next three quarters. So we would characterize this not as stagflation, but as reflation. And that difference is, reflation is actually quite good for earnings growth and quite good for the stock market, especially cyclical sectors.&amp;quot; So far, expectations are that the Fed will step in sometime mid-2022 to raise interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of Rivian (RIVN), which is backed by Ford and Amazon,  continue to be on absolute fire. The company, which is expected to lose $1.28 billion on no more than $1 million in revenue this quarter, now has a market cap of more than $100 billion. For perspective, they are now the fourth largest automaker in the world by market cap. I’m not a stickler for valuation, but this is absolute insanity and unsustainable. The company has not started production and is already priced to perfection, which they are bound to hit a snag with. I don’t think this price is sustainable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The University of Michigan’s closely monitored Consumer Sentiment survey showed the consumer sentiment index decreased to 66.8 from 71.7 in October, missing estimates of 72.5. Waning confidence reflects “ an escalating inflation rate and the growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation,” Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Snap (SNAP) investor sued the social media company alleging it downplayed how Apple’s (AAPL) change in privacy would affect revenue. Remember, the stock plummeted 25% after an earnings miss, citing Apple’s changes as hampering ad revenue. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After more than a decade of explosive growth, China&amp;#39;s Singles&amp;#39; Day, the world&amp;#39;s biggest online shopping fest, is losing its gloss and bracing for more modest growth in coming years, hurt by a slower economy and tighter regulatory scrutiny. Alibaba (BABA) said on Friday its sales - or gross merchandise value (GMV) - during the 11 day event grew 8.5%, the slowest rate ever and the first time it came under double-digits growth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it rejected an exchange-traded fund from VanEck that would have tracked Bitc… spot prices directly. This would have stood in contrast to the ProShares ETF (BITO), which was approved and which only tracks futures rather than prices directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affirm (AFRM) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $140 to $185 at Overweight. Stock currently around $149&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equifax (EFX) target raised by Needham &amp;amp; Co from $295 to $335 at Buy. Stock currently around $280&lt;/li&gt;

I followed the GameStoo saga earlier this year and recently started looking again at the two big subreddits supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my understanding, the theory goes that the shorts never actually sold their positions (because they would have gone bankrupt), but instead used all sorts of trickery to delay and avoid. Some ppl, have caught on to this and are determined to hold the stock such that when the chickens come home to roost and the shorts are forced to close, will trigger, they’ll be able to skyrocket the price. I’ve seen claims that a single share could be worth millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course sounds fantastical and far-fetched but would someone mind explaining how seemingly so many ppl have adopted this belief and are all-in on a once hated retail store? IE where are they wrong in their analysis? Is it just a case of the human factor not being realized; that once the price jumps a bit, ppl will start to sell, so the idea of holding into the 1000s plus is unrealistic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, announced a partnership that will allow customers to integrate Workplace with Microsoft Teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership between Meta and Microsoft brings together two rivals that compete in the market of enterprise communication software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership could prove most beneficial to Meta, whose Workplace service lags drastically behind its competitors in terms of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a good partnership news that will benefit both companies. Microsoft teams is gaining more marketshare as it integrates into other softwares. The partnership could prove most beneficial to Meta as teams could help to boost its Workplace enterprise social network software users. Both stocks should be in the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

But I can&amp;#39;t pass on one thought: the information has changed. Before 2008, regular folks had access to a completely different kind of information than today. I don&amp;#39;t know how the landscape changed for institutions sinc ethen, maybe they already had access to the info we use nowadays to base our decisions, maybe they even had algo trading already, but the internet was so different that it must have made a tremendous impact for them as well. It seems a relevant discussion to be had, so I&amp;#39;m asking you: do you believe this time is different? If you don&amp;#39;t, what&amp;#39;s your counter argument?&lt;/p&gt;

Bonds aren&amp;#39;t doing anything right now, so no use getting into those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One looming concern I have, and Jack Bogle talks about this in his book, is &amp;quot;reversion of the mean&amp;quot;.  He even said in an interview that sometimes you do have to time the market.  But that&amp;#39;s just my personal choice, and I am going to choose to wait until the reversion of the mean to invest in a non-tax advantaged account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thoughts on taxable ETFs? Reinvest dividends? Use dividends to pay taxes?  Are VTI and VXUS good choices?  Is skipping bonds completely a bad choice?&lt;/p&gt;
