I had some down at $13.50 from pandemic low’s and I did pick up more at $50. The book value is good. Their balance sheet had 2.98B cash, and they raised another $3B cash. Lots of investment opportunities for them to make with the cash. I believe they are going to take 1.25B and invest in their studios and sound stages (apparently demand for supply exceeds sound stages)  <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-25-billion-overhaul-bring-120028975.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-25-billion-overhaul-bring-120028975.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Looking at their balance sheets and actions I think under $50 is a steal. \nI’m not a financial advisor or expert. But a year ago someone here helped me get VIAC on my radar and I wanted to return a favor to the community, and you should add this to your watch list.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mdxi4k/viac_oversold_comparison_inside/","title":"VIAC oversold.
