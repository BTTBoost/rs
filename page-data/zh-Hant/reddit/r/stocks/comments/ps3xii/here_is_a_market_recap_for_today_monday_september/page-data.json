As has been the case for months, market participants are waiting for the Fed to signal when it might begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.66%, with the index falling more than 5% from its previous record highs for the first time all year, before somewhat pushing in the last hour of the session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.93%, while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.78%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed the most, closing the day 2.4% lower.</p>\n\n<p>Global markets were rattled today due to fears that Evergrande, the second-largest real estate developer in China with over $300 billion in liabilities, would default on its debt obligations and what the potential implications on the Chinese, and even, global economy may be. If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrande’s lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s said, it was unlikely that Evergrande’s default would cause a credit crisis “by itself” but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, “Banks’ exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for China’s financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time.” </p>\n\n<p>In this way, Evergrande has been compared to Lehman Brothers, the  Since I am not a macroeconomist nor proficient in Chinese policy, I don’t feel comfortable drawing conclusions on the potential global implications of the default, though personally I do not yet see how contagion would spread globally like in 2008 given China’s financial sector remains comparatively insular, unlike the US. While comparisons are being drawn to Lehman Brothers, a US bank whose bankruptcy catalyzed the global 2008 recession (which largely did not affect China), I think those comparisons are not correct for a few reasons, though please note this is just my humble opinion.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>For starters, it is almost a certainty the CCP will aggressively intervene in the case of a default given Evergrande is designated as an entity of “systemic importance” in China and President Xi has proven to have no problem wielding a heavy hand when it’s forced. For example, In November 2008 the government introduced a 4 trillion Yuan stimulus package (roughly $620 billion or 14 % of 2008 GDP) for 2009 and 2010. Countless other examples exist. </li>\n<li>As I said above, the relationship between Chinese and US lenders is limited at best, unlike Lehman Brothers, which existed in the balance sheets of financial institutions worldwide. This means any damage caused within China has is likely to be contained within its own economy. </li>\n<li>Unlike Lehman Brothers, Evergrande still has tangible assets that will be sold off to help settle financial obligations. While their assets aren’t great and creditors know the company is in trouble, the sale of physical assets will help some. On the other, Lehman Brothers never had hard assets it could sell-off.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Monday. As has been the theme for the past few months, market participants are looking for signals as to when the Fed may begin tapering the current pace of quantitative easing. As I have said before, I remain uncensored by QE tapering, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed starts discussing interest rate hikes</p>\n\n<p><strong>No highlights today, recap took longer to write today</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man perfected without trials.&quot; - Seneca</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ps3xii/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_monday_september/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, September 20, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-20T22:35:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-20 22:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ps3xii","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ps3xii/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_monday_september/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ps3xii/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_monday_september/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":508,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本日9月20日（月）のマーケット・リカップをご紹介します。","the_new_excerpt":"サイコ・マーケット・リカップ - 2021年9月20日（月\n\n9月20日(月)の株価は急落し、主要3指数は今年で最も悪い一日となった。\n市場参加者は、中国第2位の不動産会社のデフォルトによる波及効果を懸念している。\n中国第2位の不動産会社のデフォルトによる波及効果を懸念した市場参加者は、3つの主要指数が今年最悪の日となった。\n中国第2位の不動産会社のデフォルトによる波及効果を懸念した市場参加者は、この日、3つの主要指数は今年最悪のパフォーマンスとなりました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"以下是今天的市场回顾 2021年9月20日，星期一","the_new_excerpt":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年9月20日，星期一\n\n周一股市暴跌，三大股指出现了最差的一次\n由于市场参与者紧张地注视着潜在的\n中国第二大房地产公司的违约带来的连锁反应\n市场参与者紧张地注视着中国第二大房地产公司违约的潜在连锁反应和评论...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是今天的市場回顧 2021年9月20日，星期一","the_new_excerpt":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年9月20日，星期一\n\n週一股市暴跌，三大股指出現了最差的一次\n由於市場參與者緊張地注視着潛在的\n中國第二大房地產公司的違約帶來的連鎖反應\n市場參與者緊張地注視着中國第二大房地產公司違約的潛在連鎖反應和評論...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1440044638119682050","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1440044638119682050","title":"The Dow fell 614 points today. \n\nOnly 33,970 remain.","date":"September 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"今日のダウは614ポイント下落しました。\n\n残るは33,970。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"道琼斯指数今天下跌614点。\n\n只剩下33,970点。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"道瓊斯指數今天下跌614點。\n\n只剩下33,970點。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ps0u2e","excerpt":"Every single one I’m invested in is currently down, (and most are down between\nlike 5%-10%) And out of the over 50 stocks I’m following, only like 3 are in the\ngreen.
