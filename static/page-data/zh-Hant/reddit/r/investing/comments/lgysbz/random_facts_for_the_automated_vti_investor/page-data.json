Using Yahoo Finance historical data for VTI over the past 5 years, I ended up answering this question plus diving deeper to make a few other random observations. Here is what I found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What day of the week is best to buy VTI?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thursday</strong>, hands down</li>\n<li>Data for average delta of opening vs previous trading day close:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mon: +0.056016</li>\n<li>Tues: +0.228716</li>\n<li>Wed: +0.114864</li>\n<li>Thurs: -0.05267</li>\n<li>Fri: +0.071502</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Does the day of the week matter over a long period of time?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Basically <strong>no</strong> -- but if you&#39;re going to pick a day for auto-investing, you might as well pick Thurs</li>\n<li>I setup my spreadsheet to show the total gains of auto-investing $100/week on a given day. I did not factor in closed trading days + that M1 Finance auto-invest on the next open trading day.  So certain days (Mondays particularly) had significantly less buys than Tues/Wed.</li>\n<li>Data for average portfolio size of auto-investing in VTI:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mon: 236 buys, cost-basis $23.6k, current value $35.7k, gain 51.22%</li>\n<li>Tues: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $38.9k, gain 51.33%</li>\n<li>Wed: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $39.0k, gain 51.96%</li>\n<li>Thurs: 255 buys, cost-basis $25.5k, current value $38.7k, gain 51.93%</li>\n<li>Fri: 253 buys, cost-basis $25.3k, current value $38.4k, gain +51.83%</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>What day of the week saw best overall gains?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Still <strong>Tuesdays</strong></li>\n<li>Data for average delta of closing vs previous trading day close:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mon: +0.076398</li>\n<li>Tues: +0.160039</li>\n<li>Wed: +0.13786</li>\n<li>Thurs: +0.00851</li>\n<li>Fri: +0.061344</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>If you compare this data vs the data from bullet #1, we see a few interesting facts:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mon, Wed, and Thurs will close higher than opening</li>\n<li>Tues and Fri we see some profit taking and close slightly lower than opening</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>What would happen if you just invested the $25.7k from bullet #2 in lump sum at the beginning of the 5 year period?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Value of your VTI portfolio would be about <strong>$60.5k</strong> right now (or about 55% more)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Lastly... What would happen if you invested in yearly lump sums at the &#39;worst possible day of the year&#39; (simulating the most unlucky investor ever)?</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I divided the $25.7k into 5 parts and invested $5140 on the worst day of 2016, 17, 18, 19 and 20. The choices of &#39;worst day&#39; was completely subjective based on eye balling charts when VTI would dip over subsequent days/weeks.</li>\n<li>Dates chosen:\n\n<ul>\n<li>2016 - June 8</li>\n<li>2017 - March 1</li>\n<li>2018 - Sept 20</li>\n<li>2019 - May 3</li>\n<li>2020 - Feb 10</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Final account value was <strong>$38.6k</strong>, or roughly the same as weekly auto-investing $100.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT: Typo on the lump sum bullet. Previously said today&#39;s portfolio value would be $56.2k. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lgysbz/random_facts_for_the_automated_vti_investor/","title":"Random Facts for the Automated VTI Investor (including the best day of week to invest)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T22:57:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 22:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1ad7883c-c045-56e7-8e83-1834ff32fef0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lgysbz/random_facts_for_the_automated_vti_investor/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lgysbz/random_facts_for_the_automated_vti_investor/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Drunkueid","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Drunkueid","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Drunkueid","score":79,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"自动VTI投资者的随机事实（包括每周的最佳投资日","the_new_excerpt":"所以，这最初是由我的兴趣开始的，我想知道 \"星期几\"。\n是最好的自动投资我的M1账户'。利用雅虎金融的历史数据\n在过去的5年里，我为VTI做了大量的工作，最终回答了这个问题，加上潜水\n深入地做一些其他的随机观察。这里是我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"自動VTI投資者的隨機事實（包括每週的最佳投資日","the_new_excerpt":"所以，這最初是由我的興趣開始的，我想知道 \"星期幾\"。\n是最好的自動投資我的M1賬戶'。利用雅虎金融的歷史數據\n在過去的5年裏，我爲VTI做了大量的工作，最終回答了這個問題，加上潛水\n深入地做一些其他的隨機觀察。這裏是我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1359567288387710981","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1359567288387710981","title":"I’m in the camp that every correction is healthy if you’re a saver\n\nBut it feels like now more than ever a healthy correction is sorely needed before things get out of hand\n\nIt’s way too easy right now","date":"February 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"我认为，如果你是一个节约者，每一次修正都是健康的。\n\n但我觉得现在比以往任何时候都更需要在事情失控之前进行健康的纠正。\n\n现在太容易了","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"我認爲，如果你是一個節約者，每一次修正都是健康的。\n\n但我覺得現在比以往任何時候都更需要在事情失控之前進行健康的糾正。\n\n現在太容易了","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-52372260-f4d8-5957-8730-5eb987a7dbb5","excerpt":"Apparently we’re all saying this now, but I am not a financial advisor and you\nshould do your own DD.
