I began hoarding cash anticipating a drop and a recession that could last years and depress stock prices.</p>\n\n<p>Until I sat in one of my classes and my professor, a CMT, brought up an interesting point: we might only be at the start of the bull market. He brought up the classic SPX chart showing the enormous returns ever since the &#39;08 recession. Then he brought out other indices such as the Russell 2000 (IWM) and various Emerging Market ETFs (VEA, IEFA, AIA, etc.) and pointed out an oddity: Between 2018 and March 2020, these markets have been stagnant/flat, essentially trading within a range. He explained that while growth in the S&amp;P might have been great the last few years, practically the rest of the world lagged behind.</p>\n\n<p>Basically his point was this: now that all of these other indices/stocks are joining the rally after being stagnant for years, the real bull market is just beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, he and I could easily be wrong. But I was interested in finding out your thoughts on this, what do you guys think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","title":"Interesting Take: The Bull Market is Only Beginning","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T20:13:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 20:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2cd05158-bc7e-5df7-a0c1-838892925bbd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lmqam9/interesting_take_the_bull_market_is_only_beginning/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Misofire","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Misofire","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Misofire","score":473,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有趣的观点：牛市才刚刚开始","the_new_excerpt":"和你们很多人一样，我也认为，不久的某一天，我们长达10年的牛市一定会出现。\n结束。我开始囤积现金，期待下跌和可能持续的经济衰退。\n年，并打压股价。\n\n直到我坐在我的一节课上，我的教授，一个CMT，提出了一个。\n有趣的是：我们可能只是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有趣的觀點：牛市纔剛剛開始","the_new_excerpt":"和你們很多人一樣，我也認爲，不久的某一天，我們長達10年的牛市一定會出現。\n結束。我開始囤積現金，期待下跌和可能持續的經濟衰退。\n年，並打壓股價。\n\n直到我坐在我的一節課上，我的教授，一個CMT，提出了一個。\n有趣的是：我們可能只是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1c1d7652-caec-5948-8d27-d7351ea3e50d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmsin0/gme_turns_green_when_dfv_speaks_love_you_autists/","title":"GME turns GREEN when DFV speaks love you autists.
