&lt;p&gt;Cathie Wood — known for her innovation ETFs that garnered billions in inflows during the pandemic — said Ark Invest is internally testing a fund that takes the strategy a step further by simultaneously betting against major stocks in the benchmarks that are being disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think the benchmarks are where the big risks are long-term because they are filling up with value-traps, those companies that have done very well historically but are going to be disintermediated and disrupted by the massive amount of innovation that’s taking place,” Wood added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like Cathie Wood had found another way to attract investors money. People buying on these ark funds need to understand that the stocks inside are very random. Investors might easily lose money since many of them do not even realize what are they buying and investing.&lt;/p&gt;

The customer service team for my UI (Stake) was very responsive &amp;amp; helpful &amp;amp; basically explained that although publicly the low for the day was above my stop loss set point, it was triggered by a(likely) dark pool transaction and sent me some supporting pics of Bloomberg terminal showing the price action. I am hoping someone can help me understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an ETF that is shown moving by a few cents at a time, what kind of price action could explain a drop of 21c and then back up 20c in less than a second?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a transaction large enough to move the ETF price that much occurs, how would it not become visible on public charting like Yahoo finance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone ever encountered something like this?&lt;/li&gt;

Just a few residual logistical questions to confirm from seasoned users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall context - my family currently holds an emergency fund consisting of 12 months of expenses, in a ‘high yield’ saving account (0.4% right now). My thought is to start building an I bond ladder so that half of the emergency stash is there, with the balance remaining in readily available cash. If anyone thinks this is not a prudent idea for emergency funds I’m happy to understand why or alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After holding an I Bond for the minimum first year, how soon are the funds available (i.e a few business days for the bank transfer)? This is in the context of being emergency funds (and I know I’d lose the three months interest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm the timing of rate transfers, you are guaranteed the current rate for six months from your purchase date, and not up to the next May or November official rate change? For example, if I buy bonds in November, I get the current rate through April. If I buy next April, I’m still guaranteed the current rate through September, because I bought before the May switch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family consists of my spouse and infant child. If I was only interested in buying 20k in bonds per year (right now at least) - would it be logistically more efficient to set up my account and create a linked minor account for my child, to manage everything in one place? Or, safer to set up separate accounts for myself and spouse? I understand that I would have to delink and transfer my child’s holdings back to me while they were still a minor, but I’ve got 17 years until I’d need to worry about that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insight or tips are appreciated, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

The general consensus is that this likely will not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,  one thing that *IS* likely to happen - is that the stock price will drop after the dividend date (thus making the above strategy useless). I&amp;#39;m assuming then, and correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong, that the stock price will eventually recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this &amp;quot;recovery&amp;quot; then due to natural stock *growth* or is the recovery some sort of market mechanism specific to dividend stocks where naturally money flows back into the stock after the post-dividend drop? (I&amp;#39;m aware this could be a distinction without a difference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If recovery for many stocks is inevitable then I&amp;#39;m surprised I haven&amp;#39;t seen much discussion about investment strategies where you purchase the stock after the post-dividend drop? What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANSWERED: The assumption that the stock price will drop after the dividend date or that the stock price will recover is incorrect. Thanks to those who answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Glad to see reddit is as toxic as ever for asking a question - please get some sunshine. I find it astonishing because if you asked a question like this in real life you&amp;#39;d just get a normal answer from a normal person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV “pure plays” in the market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polestar — Volvo’s EV spinoff brand — estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polestar is the only global EV ‘pure play,’ other than Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little background…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Polestar” takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris — not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That’s &lt;em&gt;Polstjärnan&lt;/em&gt; (literal translation, “Pole Star”) if you’re Swedish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo’s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp;amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being “independent since 2017.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying Tesla’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying Lucid’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don&amp;#39;t even own the actual companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gores&amp;#39; Deals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gores’ track record speaks for itself…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EV Graveyard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Polestar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How  many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when  they IPO’d? Answer: 1,400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polestar just makes cars, baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Thomas Ingenlath: “We have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claim confirmed. And look at that jawline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bdws59yi7d181.jpg?width=279&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=acb198c00c9a8a7fd9ddbfa26f07a251d0438ccf&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bdws59yi7d181.jpg?width=279&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=acb198c00c9a8a7fd9ddbfa26f07a251d0438ccf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polestar estimates 65,000 deliveries in FY22 and revenues in excess of $3B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tdq7nril7d181.jpg?width=841&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dfe3b9e83a69063aec615d270af306824db49745&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tdq7nril7d181.jpg?width=841&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dfe3b9e83a69063aec615d270af306824db49745&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/dzlwasso7d181.jpg?width=991&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=db9cf4dfb907d3d3313827d086b4a76b653cd4a7&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dzlwasso7d181.jpg?width=991&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=db9cf4dfb907d3d3313827d086b4a76b653cd4a7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Polestar 1 came out in 2019. It’s a hybrid premium sports car that will set you back $155K… 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph. They’re badass, and hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0dasupiq7d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=434e3a17bb658785780fc7c8b6fff3256126e0bc&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0dasupiq7d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=434e3a17bb658785780fc7c8b6fff3256126e0bc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Polestar 2 launched in 2020. Polestar 2… What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think Subaru Outback meets the Model 3 — with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic. It’s a sedan, but its higher ride- height and rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a   hatchback. Let’s call it a “crossover coupe.” Available now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x8zmzdds7d181.jpg?width=855&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a84378d4ccd083505763069ba3fbd8d058eeead8&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/x8zmzdds7d181.jpg?width=855&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a84378d4ccd083505763069ba3fbd8d058eeead8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Versus the Tesla Model 3**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Polestar 2 compares favorably to the Tesla 3 in both price and range:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSRP:   $47,200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal tax credit:  -$7,500&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total:      $39,700&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range:      265 miles (single-motor base model)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla Model 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSRP:       $43,990&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal tax credit:      Does not currently qualify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total:      $43,990&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range:      262 miles (base model)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming Polestar lineup…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar 3 (2022) — luxury electric SUV built in the USA at Volvo’s South Carolina factory. Polestar also hopes to have the South Carolina vehicles be union-made… no easy task these days (looking at you, Austin   Elon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ingenlath (CEO): &amp;quot;Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American customers. I remember the great response when I first shared Polestar&amp;#39;s vision here in the USA and I am proud that our first SUV will be manufactured in South Carolina. From now on, the USA is no longer an export market but a home market.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/q4jf1pcu7d181.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49de94c3e732830f13281df5cda411c7bd069917&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q4jf1pcu7d181.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49de94c3e732830f13281df5cda411c7bd069917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar 4  (2023) — smaller SUV that will exhibit a coupe-like profile and is set to compete with the Porsche Macan and the Tesla Model Y.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar 5  (2024) — sports sedan inspired by the Precept concept car, competing with the Tesla Model S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political / Regulatory Tailwinds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and global political environment has never been more positive for investment in electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the House of Representatives voted 228-206 to pass the “Build Back Better” infrastructure bill totaling $1.2 trillion. This is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2021/11/06/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-12500-ev-tax-credit-still-awaits-passage/&quot;&gt;https://electrek.co/2021/11/06/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-12500-ev-tax-credit-still-awaits-passage/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand Rollout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series a couple weeks ago, I saw this TV commercial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launched ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human advancement, the way we live now and the damage we&amp;#39;re doing to the   planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nyberg: &amp;quot;Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s our boy Cramer at CNBC have to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x4416g7y7d181.jpg?width=404&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9f2cb070788b53713d719de41c9eac937041c70c&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/x4416g7y7d181.jpg?width=404&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9f2cb070788b53713d719de41c9eac937041c70c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cramer on $GGPI:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“They’re connected with Polestar. OK, here’s the problem: Rivian is coming public. This group has gotten a little too hot. Let’s let things cool off before we get hurt.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok,  Cramer has a point here, but not necessarily about GGPI. Your downside risk on LCID, TSLA, RIVN is technically limitless. GGPI on the other hand, has a NAV (net asset value) floor of approximately $10 until merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Leo have to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ftekhvy08d181.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=323fed8deaa4eac96ef21ac80768900f4afd3bc9&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ftekhvy08d181.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=323fed8deaa4eac96ef21ac80768900f4afd3bc9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we don’t know a lot about Leo’s investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“[CEO] Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake… DiCaprio [has] in  the  company. ‘One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is sustainability,’ Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. ‘It’s as well very important for Leo. He and us being joined on that journey, him   investing in our company, obviously that makes sense for both sides.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do the Island Bois and Hard Rock Nick have to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vrbht6x28d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=54efe6ff90c615f0ae349f89f312f67589dab256&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vrbht6x28d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=54efe6ff90c615f0ae349f89f312f67589dab256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Island Bois:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/pjgIhRy8ON8&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/pjgIhRy8ON8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Rock Nick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Po_8X3U1W_U&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/Po_8X3U1W_U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; $GGPI is taking Swedish EV auto maker Polestar public. The cars are sexy AF, and match up well with the Tesla Model 3 on both performance and price. Polestar has 29K cars on the road and $1.5B in  revenue in FY21, and still trades at a deep discount to other EV pure  plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: Long $GGPI, shares + options + warrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your outlook on the gold price for the coming months and next year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday new &lt;strong&gt;PCE inflation data&lt;/strong&gt; will be released and we all know it will be hot, but high inflation seems to just scare gold instead of bolstering it, since most seem to derive from it that the Fed will tighten more rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think however Fed will stick to its &amp;quot;inflation is transitory&amp;quot; narrative and won&amp;#39;t speed up its bond tapering, let alone raise interest rates any time soon to avoid spooking the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final point.. for those who want to bring up &lt;strong&gt;bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;, I just want to say that bitcoin and gold are not correlated in any way. Money is not flowing from gold into bitcoin. As example, in past days BTC was also down together with gold. BTC is more related to risk-on mentality like equities than it is with gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you see gold evolve coming months and next year and why? Thanks in advance for all good feedback on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: does anybody know when will be the next time Powell will speak again and will this be before the december 15th FOMC meeting? His comments on the speed of QE tapering could have a big impact on the markets and gold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a world-beating rally, sentiment on Indian shares has soured due to broker downgrades and concerns about tightening liquidity, worsened by a poor showing for the nation’s biggest initial public offering. By contrast, there is growing belief among investors that Chinese stocks could bounce back as the worst is probably over for Beijing’s regulatory scrutiny of private enterprises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Best Buy said factors that impacted margins included higher promotional activity, costs tied to the retailer&amp;#39;s new Totaltech membership program and &lt;strong&gt;organized theft at some stores&lt;/strong&gt;. Best Buy CEO Corie &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Barry said on the earnings call that organized retail crime has been &amp;quot;traumatizing&amp;quot; for associates at the stores impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Shares of Best Buy had run up 17% in the six weeks before earnings, so today&amp;#39;s decline puts shares back to where they stood in the middle part of October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Best Buy CEO says the trauma from rising retail thefts could force employees to quit. “When we talk about why there are so many people looking for other jobs or switching careers, this of course would be something that would play into my concerns for our people because again, priority one is just human safety,” she said on a call with reporters. “And it’s hard to deal with this potentially multiple times in one location.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The House legislation would address both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it would prohibit any after-tax contributions in 401(k) and other workplace plans and IRAs from being converted to Roth savings. This rule would apply to all income levels starting after Dec. 31, 2021.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so this ends regular and mega backdoor for everyone, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Secondly, savers would be unable to convert pre-tax to Roth savings in IRAs and workplace retirement plans if their taxable income exceeds $400,000 (single individuals), $450,000 (married couples), or $425,000 (heads of household). It would start after Dec. 31, 2031.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this would be what people use do to the roth conversion ladder, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i&amp;#39;ve not found anything saying these were removed, just other things saying they are in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if these stick, will the logical choice just be after tax savings once you max your 401 and are over the roth ira limit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Shares of Zoom dipped Tuesday after the video-chat company warned investors of a revenue slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The report led Wall Street banks to slash price targets on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Zoom dipped more than 15% on Tuesday after the video-chat company warned investors of a revenue growth slowdown, leading some firms to cut price targets on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom was one of the pandemic darlings, going from a relatively niche business software segment to a household product. Millions of people used the company’s tech over the past nearly two years in order to keep up with school, work or socializing. But growth is slowing as people return to work and school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTIG, which lowered its price target to $400 from $460, reiterated its buy rating, but said the cut was to “better reflect current market sentiment and group multiple compression.” Deutsche Bank Research also lowered its 12-month target to $280 from $350.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom opened at $218.05 on Tuesday and the stock is down more than 35% year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While we’re positive on Zoom’s strategic initiatives and investments in key growth areas, we find it tougher to like a stock with more sharply decelerating growth and incremental pressure on profitability,” the researchers wrote in a Tuesday note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baird, Guggenheim, Wells Fargo, Stifel, UBS, Piper Sandler and KeyBanc also dropped their price targets. But Wall Street is generally still bullish on Zoom’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Moderating growth has been, and could continue to be a near-term stock headwind, though we remain positive on the long-term growth and platform opportunity particularly as the growth rate troughs over the next couple quarters,” Baird researchers wrote Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom’s revenue increased 35% from a year earlier in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, slowing from 54% growth in the quarter before. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Zoom forecast adjusted earnings of $1.06 to $1.07 per share on $1.051 billion to $1.053 billion in revenue, which implies 19% growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the 20 year bond is sitting around 2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if the federal reserve changes the base lending interest rate from 0-0.25% (which is what it is at now) to 0.25-0.50% (which is the most likely occurence we&amp;#39;re going to see monetary policy wise) within the next 12-18 months, what does that do to the 20 year treasury bond for example? does it go up 0.25bps?&lt;/p&gt;

I commented that they should post this here and they gave me permission to do so.  I have seen this paper referenced a number of times on this sub so I&amp;#39;m curious to hear peoples&amp;#39; thoughts on this rebuttal.  I have no personal bias one way or the other, just curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have seen this paper (&lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701&quot;&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701&lt;/a&gt;) floating around various investment subreddits over the past week. It usually comes with the title How to 3x the S&amp;amp;P CAGR with less risk | Leverage for the Long Run with people praising it as an amazing new strategy that requires little effort, provides a high degree of safety, and allows you to experience only the good side of leveraged ETFs. Here&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s complete bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen the 200 SMA argument posted hundreds of times before in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/LETFs&quot;&gt;r/LETFs&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m glad this one at least comes with a paper, but the paper is still falling for the same mistakes other believers fall for. The author is correct that volatility increases below any significant moving average (20/50/100/200), however, avoiding volatility should not be your main concern when holding unhedged leveraged ETFs. Your main concern should be flash crashes like in 1987 where the market fell 22% in one day. The author says this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chart 6 shows that historically, the worst 1% of trading days have occurred far more often than not below the Moving Average. Included in this list are the two worst days in market history: October 19th in 1987 and October 28th in 1929&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow look at that, moving averages helped avoid the worst two days... but why? The answer is partially due to the fact that both the best and worst days will be in periods of high volatility, but it&amp;#39;s also heavily influenced by pure chance. A day like Black Monday could happen at anytime and if there wasn&amp;#39;t a choppy market leading up to it you will miss it with moving averages. An unleveraged 22% drop would be a 66% drop for the portfolio suggested in the paper. The market would then likely dip below the 200 SMA and the person would sell! Missing the entire ride back up, even if there was more to fall you&amp;#39;re not going to be left in a good place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no macroeconomic reason that moving averages have any form of predictive power. The closest thing would be the concept of a self fulfilling prophecy which would require a massive audience of believers to have an impact (there are not nearly enough). People always use 200 SMA, but if you try to test other SMAs nearby you sometimes get significantly worse results. The 200 SMA just happens to get you out before the Dot Com crash as well as the GFC. When your entire reasoning is based on well it did good in the past you&amp;#39;re overfitting by definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at another strategy that has an economic backing - HFEA. Holding stocks and bonds together isn&amp;#39;t something that just happens to work when you test it. When stocks experience uncertainty large investors move their money into the safety of bonds which forces them in the opposite direction to the stock. Stocks and bonds are slightly, but not perfectly inversely correlated and both of them have positive expected returns. This is why they are the ideal hedge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that this is not an academic paper that came from a university. It was published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leadlagreport.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.leadlagreport.com/&lt;/a&gt; which says on its homepage &amp;quot;Consistently win in the stock market and minimize risk regardless of market conditions&amp;quot; followed by a subscribe button. This is called bullshit and I encourage anyone who cares about honesty to call it out when shit like this is posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the administration will tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as part of a global effort from energy-consuming nations to calm 2021′s rapid rise in fuel prices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The coordinated release between the U.S., India, China, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom is the first such move of its kind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In total, the U.S. will release &lt;strong&gt;50 million barrels&lt;/strong&gt; from the SPR. Of the total 32 million barrels will be an exchange over the next several months, while 18 million barrels will be an acceleration of a previously authorized sale.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;U.S. oil &lt;strong&gt;dipped 1.9%&lt;/strong&gt; to a session low of $75.30 per barrel following the announcement, before recovering some of those losses. The contract last traded 34 cents lower at $76.41. International benchmark Brent crude stood at $79.98 per barrel, for a gain of 34 cents.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/oil-prices-fall-on-bidens-decision-to-release-u-s-strategic-reserves-51637670056?mod=hp_LEAD_1&quot;&gt;Barron&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shares in big oil companies were also down, with both Shell (ticker: RDSA.London) and BP ( BP.London) falling 0.8%, TotalEnergies (TTE.France) up 0.2%.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shares of U.S. major oil companies were also sliding in pre-trading hours, with Exxon Mobil (XOM) declining by 0.3%. Chevron‘s (CVX) stock price was stable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this oil reserve gambit going to slow down inflation enough to keep the growth stocks in the green? Or was yesterday&amp;#39;s drop just the beginning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chart 6 shows that historically, the worst 1% of trading days have occurred far more often than not below the Moving Average. Included in this list are the two worst days in market history: October 19th in 1987 and October 28th in 1929&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow look at that, moving averages helped avoid the worst two days... but why? The answer is partially due to the fact that both the best and worst days will be in periods of high volatility, but it&amp;#39;s also heavily influenced by pure chance. A day like Black Monday could happen at anytime and if there wasn&amp;#39;t a choppy market leading up to it you will miss it with moving averages. An unleveraged 22% drop would be a 66% drop for the portfolio suggested in the paper. The market would then likely dip below the 200 SMA and the person would sell! Missing the entire ride back up, even if there was more to fall you&amp;#39;re not going to be left in a good place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no macroeconomic reason that moving averages have any form of predictive power. The closest thing would be the concept of a self fulfilling prophecy which would require a massive audience of believers to have an impact (there are not nearly enough). People always use 200 SMA, but if you try to test other SMAs nearby you sometimes get significantly worse results. The 200 SMA just happens to get you out before the Dot Com crash as well as the GFC. When your entire reasoning is based on &lt;em&gt;well it did good in the past&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;re overfitting by definition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at another strategy that &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; an economic backing - HFEA. Holding stocks and bonds together isn&amp;#39;t something that &lt;em&gt;just happens to work&lt;/em&gt; when you test it. When stocks experience uncertainty large investors move their money into the safety of bonds which forces them in the opposite direction to the stock. Stocks and bonds are slightly, but not perfectly inversely correlated &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; both of them have positive expected returns. This is why they are the ideal hedge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that &lt;strong&gt;this is not an academic paper that came from a university&lt;/strong&gt;. It was published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leadlagreport.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.leadlagreport.com/&lt;/a&gt; which says on its homepage &amp;quot;Consistently win in the stock market and minimize risk regardless of market conditions&amp;quot; followed by a subscribe button. This is called bullshit and I encourage anyone who cares about honesty to call it out when shit like this is posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point high inflation/interest rates has to be priced in right ?&lt;/p&gt;
