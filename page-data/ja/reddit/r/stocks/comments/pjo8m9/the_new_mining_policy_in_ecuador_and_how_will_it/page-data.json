He has his background since he was a former banker and knows how important it is to bring in investors to improve the economy.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this new decree, the activities of mining companies will improve even more. Just recently, Solaris Resources’ (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/community/\">SLSSF</a>) Warintza project produced some results, with the initial hole at East was drilled to a total depth of 1,213m with assays reported for the first 320m of core returning 0.46% of CuEq from the surface, including 54 meters of 0.70% CuEq. This is only the beginning though since the company plans to focus on resource expansion. Their stocks have been performing really well lately, despite that recent dip a few weeks back.</p>\n\n<p>SolGold (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/solg.l/\">SOLG.L</a>), another mining company whose mines are located in Ecuador, also released its regional exploration update. Their Hole 1 at Varela is testing underneath outcropping porphyry-style vein stockworks which returned encouraging surface rock-saw channel sample results of 99m @ 0.34% CuEq including 25.1m @ 0.58% CuEq. </p>\n\n<p>But along with the decree is the promise of responsible mining and the inclusivity of the local community. Hopefully, these mining companies will stay true to their own projects of involving the local communities in these mines and making sure that there will be no over-exploitation of mineral resources. After all, the mining industry will definitely affect Ecuador’s economy in a positive way, the same way it helped its neighboring countries in South America.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pjo8m9/the_new_mining_policy_in_ecuador_and_how_will_it/","title":"The new mining policy in Ecuador and how will it affect companies","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-07T16:13:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-07 16:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pjo8m9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjo8m9/the_new_mining_policy_in_ecuador_and_how_will_it/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjo8m9/the_new_mining_policy_in_ecuador_and_how_will_it/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Cool-Statement-6959","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cool-Statement-6959","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Cool-Statement-6959","score":168,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"エクアドルの新鉱業政策と企業への影響","the_new_excerpt":"先月、エクアドルのギジェルモ・ラッソ大統領は、新しい鉱業政策を中心とした政令151号を発行しました。\nを発行し、経済の牽引役である鉱業への政府の支援を強化しました。\n鉱業は経済の重要な原動力であり、政府の支援を強化するものです。\n\n以下の記事によると\n[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"厄瓜多尔的新矿业政策以及它将如何影响公司","the_new_excerpt":"就在上个月，厄瓜多尔总统吉列尔莫-拉索发布了第151号法令。\n该法令侧重于新的采矿政策，加强了政府对采矿业的支持，将其作为经济发展的主要动力。\n采矿业是经济发展的主要动力。\n\n根据这篇文章\n[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"厄瓜多爾的新礦業政策以及它將如何影響公司","the_new_excerpt":"就在上個月，厄瓜多爾總統吉列爾莫-拉索發佈了第151號法令。\n該法令側重於新的採礦政策，加強了政府對採礦業的支持，將其作爲經濟發展的主要動力。\n採礦業是經濟發展的主要動力。\n\n根據這篇文章\n[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pjmdsd","excerpt":"Anyone have any thoughts on this?
