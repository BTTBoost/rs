I&#39;ve been reading a lot of info recently and while they are not conflicting, I have some trouble taking it all in. </p>\n\n<p>First, I see people saying options are expiring yesterday and next week with strike prices below market value. This means the market makers have to buy stocks and drive up the price. What I don&#39;t understand is, I thought the point of option are you don&#39;t have to exercise if it is unfavorable, so couldn&#39;t the market makers just not exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I hear people saying shorts technically have no expiry date, they just have to pay a premium. What is to say they just wait the fomo out? </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I&#39;ve been seeing that there are like 4xx million volumes of AMC traded around which easily exceeds the number of shares shorted.
