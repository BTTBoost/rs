Tesla is a 1 trillion dollar company, trading at a P/E of 330, a similar multiple for FCF, a P/S of around 30 for an automaker, and many more insane multiples while growing 50% on the extremely high side and about 35-40% for just a few more years in my opninion. Okay, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK WE ARE IN A GIANT FUCKING BUBBLE, let that sink in, THEY ARE WORTH A TRILLION FUCKING DOLLARS, WITH ONLY 46 BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND ONLY 3.4 BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT, THEY WERE LITERALLY UNPROFITABLE ONLY 3 YEARS AGO, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. I DONT GIVE A SHIT IF THEY ARE GROWING, THAT DOESN&#39;T MEAN THEY JUST GO UP FOREVER BECAUSE THIS IS SO FUCKING RIDICULOUS.</p>\n\n<p>TESLA IS NOT A FUCKING CAR COMPANY, GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THIK FUCKING HEAD, THEY HAVE MARGINS WORSE THAN A CAR COMPANY YET FOR SOME INSANE REASON THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS ONE, ALSO, EVEN WITH 50% GROWTH THEY ARE STILL AT A PEG OF OVER 6 AND PUT INTO A DCF ASSUMING THE MOST BULLISH OF GROWTH ESTIMATES THEY ARE RIDICULOUSLY FUCKING OVERVALUED TO AN EXTENT NEVER SEEN BEFORE.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, I don&#39;t know what the actual fuck to say, it&#39;s so obvious that they&#39;re overvalued, and there are no reasons for why it should have reached this point, and maybe I just don&#39;t get it, but idk, maybe I&#39;m doing something wrong, your thoughts? Don&#39;t downvote this to hell please.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qfte3a/tesla_is_the_most_overvalued_company_of_all_time/","title":"Tesla is the Most overvalued Company of all Time","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-26T00:44:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-26 00:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qfte3a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qfte3a/tesla_is_the_most_overvalued_company_of_all_time/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qfte3a/tesla_is_the_most_overvalued_company_of_all_time/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Miladyboi","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miladyboi","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Miladyboi","score":164,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テスラは史上最も過大評価された企業である","the_new_excerpt":"わかったわかった、この投稿をダウンボットする前に説明しておくと、これは単に\nテスラが1兆ドル規模の企業になったことを。\n\nまず、2025年にこの記事に戻ってくるように、どんな方法であれ、リマインダーを設定してほしい。\nこの記事に戻ってきて、みんながどれだけクソバカなのか、どれだけ幸福感に浸っているのかを実感してほしい。\n陶酔しているのかを...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"特斯拉是有史以来被高估的公司","the_new_excerpt":"好吧好吧，在你给这个帖子投下反对票之前，让我解释一下，因为这简直是\n特斯拉现在是一家价值1万亿美元的公司，这简直是痴人说梦。\n\n首先，我希望你为2025年设定一个提醒，不管你怎么做，都要回过头来看看这个帖子，并意识到每个人都是多么的愚蠢，以及他们是多么的不负责任。\n回过头来看这个帖子，并意识到每个人都是多么他妈的愚蠢，以及如何\n欣喜若狂的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉是有史以來被高估的公司","the_new_excerpt":"好吧好吧，在你給這個帖子投下反對票之前，讓我解釋一下，因爲這簡直是\n特斯拉現在是一家價值1萬億美元的公司，這簡直是癡人說夢。\n\n首先，我希望你爲2025年設定一個提醒，不管你怎麼做，都要回過頭來看看這個帖子，並意識到每個人都是多麼的愚蠢，以及他們是多麼的不負責任。\n回過頭來看這個帖子，並意識到每個人都是多麼他媽的愚蠢，以及如何\n欣喜若狂的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1452754174991536134","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1452754174991536134","title":"S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high for the 56th time this year. $SPX https://t.co/bOglJRQD1y","date":"October 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"S&S;P 500は、今年56回目の史上最高値で取引を終了しました。$SPX https://t.co/bOglJRQD1y","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"S&amp;P 500指数今年第56次收于历史新高。$SPX https://t.co/bOglJRQD1y","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"S&amp;P 500指數今年第56次收於歷史新高。$SPX https://t.co/bOglJRQD1y","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qfmqgs","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qfmqgs/how_are_my_dwac_bag_holders_doing/","title":"How are my $DWAC bag holders doing?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 26, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の$DWACバッグホルダーはどうなっていますか？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的$DWAC持袋人表现如何？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的$DWAC持袋人表現如何？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qfte3a","previousId":"TweetPost-1452754174991536134","nextId":"RedditPost-qfmqgs","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qfte3a/tesla_is_the_most_overvalued_company_of_all_time/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
