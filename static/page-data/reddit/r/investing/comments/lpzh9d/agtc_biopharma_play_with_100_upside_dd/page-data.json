My position in AGTC is 300 @ 7.65. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is AGTC?</strong></p>\n\n<p>AGTC is a Biopharmaceutical company that focuses on gene therapies to treat rare inherited genetic conditions. They specialize in treating eye conditions, and have a substantial pipeline with promising results. This pipeline includes treatment for X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP), which is in extended phase 2 clinical trials. They are also in clinical trials for a treatment of Achromatopsia. You can see their full pipeline here: <a href=\"https://agtc.com/programs/\">https://agtc.com/programs/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is XLRP?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;</strong>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) describes a group of rare genetic eye diseases that damage light-sensitive cells in the retina, leading to loss of sight over time. In about 10% of RP cases, the non-working gene is passed down from the mother to her children resulting in a form of RP known as X-Linked RP (XLRP). For more information about how retinitis pigmentosa is inherited and the impact on the vision of male and female children, please go to <a href=\"https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/retinitis-pigmentosa\">https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/retinitis-pigmentosa.</a></p>\n\n<p>XLRP causes gradual vision loss in boys and young men. The disease begins with night blindness and is followed by a slow narrowing of the peripheral field of vision. In general, the decline in vision (also referred to as “visual acuity”) results in a person becoming legally blind in their 40s.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Catalysts</strong></p>\n\n<p>AGTC recently took part in the OIS Gene Therapy Innovation Showcase and showed extremely promising results from their XLRP trials. I watched the conference and CEO Sue Washer spoke clearly and confidently about their results. Unfortunately the YouTube video was made private, and I am unable to locate it anywhere. If I find a link I will update this post. </p>\n\n<p>AGTC is also presenting this week at the 4th annual Gene Therapy for Rare Disorders digital event. Information on this event can be found here: <a href=\"https://genetherapy-conference.com/\">https://genetherapy-conference.com/</a> </p>\n\n<p>AGTC currently has a strong buy rating with an average price target of $16.71. Low price target is $9, high price target is $35. Right now looks like a perfect entry point, and I have spent the day averaging down during the dip. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AGTC/research-ratings\">https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AGTC/research-ratings</a></p>\n\n<p>The analyst that gave a $35 PT is Zegbeh Jallah Ph D, a senior research analyst in the biotech sector for Roth Capital. I tend to listen to voices such as hers! </p>\n\n<p>AGTC is also speculated to be a buyout candidate by Sanofi. These are just rumors, but there is a lot of reason to be optimistic moving forward! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Institutional Ownership</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to Fintel, AGTC has institutional ownership pushing 40%. This is generally a great sign for retail investors. Institutions generally don&#39;t invest in failing companies. <a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/agtc\">https://fintel.io/so/us/agtc</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Competitors</strong></p>\n\n<p>AGTC isn&#39;t the only company that is developing XLRP therapy. Currently the two main competitors are Biogen (BIIB) and Mieragtx (MGTX). Both of these companies are also in clinical trials for their XLRP treatment, but what sets AGTC apart is the efficacy and safety of their treatments. Compared to their competitors, AGTC&#39;s therapy is not only more effective, but also has far fewer incidents of negative side effects. </p>\n\n<p>Recently AGTC went through a big pump. On Feb 1 the stock was trading right around $4 and shot up all the way to $9+ by 2/11, and again on 2/17. The last few days of trading we are seeing a steady pullback, with a share price of $6.39 at the time of writing. This presents a fantastic entry point in my opinion. With an average price target of $16+, AGTC could easily see 150% growth over the next 12 months, with potential to soar well above that if the clinical trials continue to show positive results. </p>\n\n<p>There isn&#39;t much to dislike about this company. Their leadership team is extremely seasoned, they are narrowly focused, their trials show incredible promise and they are the clear front runners among their competitors for XLRP treatment!</p>\n\n<p>As always, do your own DD before investing!
