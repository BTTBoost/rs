Cant just endlessly say Intel is terrible.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12600k-cpu-faster-than-ryzen-5-5600x-blows-away-rocket-lake-core-i9-11900k-leaked-benchmarks/\">https://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12600k-cpu-faster-than-ryzen-5-5600x-blows-away-rocket-lake-core-i9-11900k-leaked-benchmarks/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The performance benchmarks show the Intel Core i5-12600K blasting up the single-core test with a score of 773 points and the multi-core test with 7220 points. This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD&#39;s 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks, the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel&#39;s Rocket Lake flagship couldn&#39;t keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.</p>\n\n<p>Now think about it this way, you are essentially getting slightly better performance than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, a $400 US+ chip, in a processor that costs $30 US lower than the Ryzen 5 5600X. It sounds like an absolutely phenomenal deal. Obviously, there are a few drawbacks which include investing in a brand new platform and migrating to a new OS platform (Windows 11 in this case) which would raise the cost and effort but if you set your mind aside from these short-term concerns, the Core i5-12600K could end up serving you far better performance at an insane value proposition. Furthermore, it is also stated that owing to the 12600K being segmented in the Core i5 lineup, its power consumption and thermals won&#39;t be as rampant as the high-end models.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qgx3ee/intel_core_i512600k_cpu_up_to_50_faster_than/","title":"Intel Core i5-12600K CPU Up To 50% Faster Than Ryzen 5 5600X, Blows Away The Rocket Lake Core i9-11900K Flagship In Leaked Benchmarks","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-28T05:16:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-28 05:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qgx3ee","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qgx3ee/intel_core_i512600k_cpu_up_to_50_faster_than/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qgx3ee/intel_core_i512600k_cpu_up_to_50_faster_than/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Oscuridad_mi_amigo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Oscuridad_mi_amigo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Oscuridad_mi_amigo","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Intel Core i5-12600K CPUはRyzen 5 5600Xよりも最大50%高速で、Rocket LakeのフラッグシップモデルであるCore i9-11900Kをリークされたベンチマークで吹き飛ばしています。","the_new_excerpt":"AMDとNvidiaのファンボーイの皆さん、技術仕様はこちらです。ただ延々と言うだけでは\nインテルはひどい」と延々と言い続けることになります。\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12600k-cpu-faster-than-ryzen-5-5600x-blows-away-rocket-lake-core-i9-11900k-leaked-benchmarks/\n\n> パフォーマンスベンチマークでは、Intel Core i5-12600Kが爆速で...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"英特尔酷睿i5-12600K CPU比Ryzen 5 5600X快50%，在泄露的基准测试中击败了火箭湖酷睿i9-11900K旗舰产品","the_new_excerpt":"对于所有AMD/Nvidia的粉丝，技术规格在这里。不能只是无休止地说\n英特尔是可怕的。\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12600k-cpu-faster-than-ryzen-5-5600x-blows-away-rocket-lake-core-i9-11900k-leaked-benchmarks/\n\n> 性能基准显示，英特尔酷睿i5-12600K爆破了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"英特爾酷睿i5-12600K CPU比Ryzen 5 5600X快50%，在泄露的基準測試中擊敗了火箭湖酷睿i9-11900K旗艦產品","the_new_excerpt":"對於所有AMD/Nvidia的粉絲，技術規格在這裏。不能只是無休止地說\n英特爾是可怕的。\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-core-i5-12600k-cpu-faster-than-ryzen-5-5600x-blows-away-rocket-lake-core-i9-11900k-leaked-benchmarks/\n\n> 性能基準顯示，英特爾酷睿i5-12600K爆破了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qh9ope","excerpt":"I’m 18 and currently investing 80% into VTI and 20% into VXUS.
