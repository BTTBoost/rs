This is despite new economic data that showed US GDP slowdown to its slowest expansion rate in over a year and new weekly unemployment claims. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the major indexes on the day. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest the ongoing corporate earning season.</p>\n\n<p>The GDP report showed the economy decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier in the week, the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike. Cases in the US retreated from a high in the previous spike of 285,058 to 105,561 in between September 13 and October 25. The Conference Board&#39;s consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September. This came in higher than the 108.0 consensus economists were looking for, according to Bloomberg data. It also marked the first monthly increase in confidence since June.  </p>\n\n<p>The latest batch of earnings results helped affirm to Wall Street that many companies will be able to work through rising price pressures to continue delivering estimates-topping sales and profits. Though the expectation is that  inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions could last for longer than previously anticipated, the impacts will be surmountable to most companies. </p>\n\n<p>Lori Calvasina, Chief Equity Strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said “What we’ve got from these supply chain issues is a near-term earnings problem. I think it&#39;s something we do have to monitor in the first half of the year. Earnings growth is only tracking at 4% or 6% in the first two quarters of next year. So companies do have to keep managing through for the market to continue to move up. But the reality is that the underlying economic backdrop simply is not stagnant. I really just don’t buy into that stagflation argument at all.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Teradyne (TER) upgraded UBS Group, Craig Hallum and Cowen to Buy and Outperform</li>\n<li>Boot Barn (BOOT) had price target raised by multiple analysts on the back of earnings call</li>\n<li>Chubb (CB) has price target raised by Raymond James, Barclays, &amp; Royal Bank of Canada to over $220</li>\n<li>Ebay (EBAY) with multiple analyst target price raises</li>\n<li>Hilton Worldwide (HLT) with multiple analyst price target raises</li>\n<li>McDonalds (MCD) with multiple price target raises</li>\n<li>Service Now (NOW) destroyed earnings and received host of price target raises.</li>\n<li>Spotify (SPOT) with multiple price target raises after earnings</li>\n<li>Xiliinx (XLNX) with multiple aggressive price target raises</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#39;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams&#39; Eleanor Roosevelt</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qhvaeq/psychomarket_recap_thursday_october_28_2021/","title":"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 28, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-29T02:56:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-29 02:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qhvaeq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qhvaeq/psychomarket_recap_thursday_october_28_2021/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qhvaeq/psychomarket_recap_thursday_october_28_2021/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":65,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"サイコ・マーケット総集編～2021年10月28日(木)","the_new_excerpt":"米国の株式市場は引き続き好調で、主要3指数はすべて上昇し、ハイテク株の多いNasdaq（QQQ）は日中の最高値を更新しました。\n株は、主要3指数ともに上昇し、ハイテク株の多いナスダック(QQQ)は、日中の最高値を更新しました。\n株は顕著な上昇を続けています。これは、米国のGDP成長率の鈍化を示す新しい経済指標が発表されたにもかかわらずです。\n米国のGDPが過去最高の成長率に鈍化したにもかかわらず、このような結果となりました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年10月28日，星期四","the_new_excerpt":"股市继续其显著的反弹，所有三个主要指数都在上升，而科技股的纳斯达克指数（QQQ）则在市场上达到了新的盘中高点。\n科技股的纳斯达克指数（QQQ）达到新的盘中高点，因为大型科技股在财报期间继续走强。\n巨大的科技股在财报期间继续走强。尽管新的经济\n数据显示，美国国内生产总值放缓至其最慢的扩张速度。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年10月28日，星期四","the_new_excerpt":"股市繼續其顯著的反彈，所有三個主要指數都在上升，而科技股的納斯達克指數（QQQ）則在市場上達到了新的盤中高點。\n科技股的納斯達克指數（QQQ）達到新的盤中高點，因爲大型科技股在財報期間繼續走強。\n巨大的科技股在財報期間繼續走強。儘管新的經濟\n數據顯示，美國國內生產總值放緩至其最慢的擴張速度。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qhoich","excerpt":"Genuine question.
