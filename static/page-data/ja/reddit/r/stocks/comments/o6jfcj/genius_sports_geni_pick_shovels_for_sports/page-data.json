A huge discount to the price targets above. Part of this discount is <strong>$GENI</strong> recently had an upsized stock offering of 22 million shares. While the market reacted negatively, Oppenheimer came out and reiterated their PT of $32 as they saw this as a positive for the company to raise cash to continue to acquire companies that complement their offerings. Most recently they acquired Second Spectrum (Augmented reality and tracking technology backed by Steve Ballmer), and Fanhub (free to play games). </p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> $GENI is the the pick and shovel data provider to all the favorite sports betting books including $DKNG, and the only publicly traded sports betting data provider in one of the fastest growing segments in the US market.
