While I enjoy lurking on WSB, I am a boring investor: most of my holdings are very broad ETFs, and I usually try to limit large exposure to single stocks. Even when I do have opinions about fundamentals of a stock, I rarely act on them. Instead, for shorter term trades: I try to trade on (relative) price levels (hence I like wheeling stocks) and data relating to market sentiment.</p>\n\n<p>After wheeling RDSA over the past few months I have become increasingly more convinced that it is underpriced and I would like to share my findings hoping that you guys can help me find any flaws or things I am not considering.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am long (own stocks, long term calls and short puts short term) and you should not make financial decisions based on random posts on reddit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bull: oil prices are recovering to pre-covid levels, RDS is not</strong></p>\n\n<p>A quote that you often find in newspapers and magazine articles states that “for every dollar the oil price goes down, Shell loses 400M in net profits”. While this is an old quote, and should be met with scepticism, it cannot be denied that there should be a relation between oil prices and Shell&#39;s profitability. In the two plots below, I have plotted Shell’s Stock price with the oil price (i) and scattered them against each other(ii). A few things can be noticed:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/2Mf5tuf\">https://imgur.com/2Mf5tuf</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/DtDDeAg\">https://imgur.com/DtDDeAg</a>  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>RDSA and oil prices seem correlated, for the last year, this correlation looks different than for previous years. I don&#39;t want to get too technical in this post, but If you make a simple linear regression to explain the stock price from the oil price and plot the residuals, the latter prices for the stock are extreme outliers.</li>\n<li>RDSAs sharp drop last year coincided with low oil prices which might be explained by COVID19. While oil prices have recovered, Shell is still trading at a discount compared to pre-COVID times.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Other possible bull points include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Share buyback program was halted due to COVID, it would make sense that it starts up again now that oil prices are recovering, since the stock is trading (way) lower than it was when the buyback program was announced. Currently no such announcement is made though, this is pure speculation on my end.</li>\n<li>Commodity companies are widely regarded as a nice hold during times with inflation. Although I am no expert in macro-economic trends and as such will not judge whether there will be inflation or not, it can’t be denied that there is a lot of talk about it, which will drive sentiment.</li>\n<li>price/book value currently &lt;1</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bear: Sustainability, reputation and legal</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let’s be honest, oil companies are not hip to hold and are widely regarded as unfriendly polluters ruining our planet. In fact, in an article I read recently (offline) it stated that shell was 4th place worldwide in a list of most hated companies. I believe stuff like this has an impact on market sentiment. Just like it is ‘hip’ and ‘cool’ to hold TSLA, it is the exact opposite for shell.</p>\n\n<p>Second, also due to CO2 worries, we can all agree that RDS might not be a very long term hold, as we as a society will try to reduce our carbon emissions. I personally think that oil/gas will be at least as important as they are now for at least the next 15 years (long enough for me). But in the very long term, Shell will have to change and adapt to new circumstances. In fact, a Dutch court recently ordered Shell to reduce CO2 emissions by 45% before 2030 after a trial between Shell and environmentalists. While this verdict will be appealed, and does not stipulate any punishment if Shell fails, the societal tendency is clear: Shell will have to fundamentally change in the long run; History shows that it is very hard for large companies to do so.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oq0f5y/royal_dutch_shell_why_i_am_long/","title":"Royal Dutch Shell, why I am long","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-24T11:40:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-24 11:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d5f72492-faec-5149-ae71-ee0adbf82236","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oq0f5y/royal_dutch_shell_why_i_am_long/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oq0f5y/royal_dutch_shell_why_i_am_long/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Murhie","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Murhie","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Murhie","score":39,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロイヤル・ダッチ・シェル、なぜ私はロングなのか","the_new_excerpt":"この1年半ほど、私はヨーロッパの人気銘柄を対象に、「ザ・ホイール」のような戦略を実行してきましたが、いかがでしたか？\nのような戦略を実行しています。Royal Dutch shell (ロンドン、NYSE、AMSの各証券取引所で取引されている)\nロンドン、NYSE、AMSの各証券取引所で取引されています）。) 私はWSBに出没することを楽しんでいますが、私は退屈な投資家です。\n私はつまらない投資家です：私の保有株のほとんどは非常に幅広いETFで、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"荷兰皇家壳牌公司，我为什么做多","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，在过去的18个月左右，我一直在运行类似于 \"轮子 \"的策略。\n的策略，在一个非常受欢迎的欧洲股票上。荷兰皇家壳牌公司（在伦敦、纽约和美国证券交易所交易\n在伦敦、纽约证券交易所和AMS证券交易所交易）。) 虽然我喜欢潜伏在WSB上，但我是一个\n无聊的投资者：我持有的大部分股票都是非常广泛的ETF，而且我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"荷蘭皇家殼牌公司，我爲什麼做多","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，在過去的18個月左右，我一直在運行類似於 \"輪子 \"的策略。\n的策略，在一個非常受歡迎的歐洲股票上。荷蘭皇家殼牌公司（在倫敦、紐約和美國證券交易所交易\n在倫敦、紐約證券交易所和AMS證券交易所交易）。) 雖然我喜歡潛伏在WSB上，但我是一個\n無聊的投資者：我持有的大部分股票都是非常廣泛的ETF，而且我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-48c9d4bb-4d95-597f-9fc7-15f6ab76565e","excerpt":"AAPL was the first U.S. company to reach a 2 Trillion dollar market cap in 2020.\n\nIt begs the question.
