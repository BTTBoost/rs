The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.8% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.47% in its third consecutive red day while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.61% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 1.58% lower.</p>\n\n<p>This morning, the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. </p>\n\n<p>The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. </p>\n\n<p>Though the Fed has commenced a tapering in the pace of quantitative easing, members of the Fed have so far maintained that supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances caused by the pandemic have prevented producers from keeping up with demand, particularly as we head into the busiest time of the year, the holiday season. I broadly agree with this narrative, even the Fed has conceded that inflation could last longer “than they currently assume”. The latest Fed meeting minutes said, “Most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.” We’ll have to see what happens in the coming months, if inflation doesn’t begin moderating in the next 5-6 months, the Fed will likely be forced to step in and raise interest rates in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf\">https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>No highlights today sorry, will be back tomorrow</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.&quot;</em> -Eleanor Roosevelt</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qr6lxi/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednseday_nov_10/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednseday, Nov 10, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T02:18:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 02:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qr6lxi","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qr6lxi/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednseday_nov_10/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qr6lxi/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednseday_nov_10/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本日2021年11月10日(水)のマーケットレポです。","the_new_excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - 2021年11月10日（水\n\n2021年11月10日(水)のサイコ・マーケットを振り返る。\n大流行している失業保険申請件数が過去最高となったにもかかわらず、消費者物価が予想以上に上昇したことを示す重要なインフレレポートが発表された。\nこれは、新規失業保険申請件数がパンデミック以来の低水準であったにもかかわらず、消費者物価が予想以上に上昇したことを示しています。その結果\nS&P 500...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"以下是今天（星期三）的市场回顾，2021年11月10日","the_new_excerpt":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年11月10日，星期三\n\n股市令人眼花缭乱的涨势在下列情况下戛然而止\n发布了一份关键的通货膨胀报告，该报告显示，尽管新申请的失业救济金人数达到了大流行的水平，但消费者价格的跳升幅度超过了预期。\n尽管新申请的失业救济金人数达到了大流行时期的低点，但股市令人目眩的涨势还是戛然而止。证券时报\n标准普尔500指数...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是今天（星期三）的市場回顧，2021年11月10日","the_new_excerpt":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年11月10日，星期三\n\n股市令人眼花繚亂的漲勢在下列情況下戛然而止\n發佈了一份關鍵的通貨膨脹報告，該報告顯示，儘管新申請的失業救濟金人數達到了大流行的水平，但消費者價格的跳升幅度超過了預期。\n儘管新申請的失業救濟金人數達到了大流行時期的低點，但股市令人目眩的漲勢還是戛然而止。證券時報\n標準普爾500指數...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qr7hcg","excerpt":"Periodically, we get posts on here of people with doubts about the market.\nToday, between Evergrande, crypto, and lord knows what else, there are plenty of\nreasons for uncertainty.
