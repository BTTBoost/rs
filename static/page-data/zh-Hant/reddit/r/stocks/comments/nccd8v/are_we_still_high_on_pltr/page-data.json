The consensus was that it’s an innovative company with huge growth potential and its product is like no other. I’ll leave the post below. I too have bought into Palantir because i to believe it has huge growth potential. Problem is the market does not agree with me. The stock is almost done 47% since February of this year and down 15% this month. Today it had a rebound but for people has the consensus changed for you. Cathie wood has had a field day loading up in shares. Their March quarter revenue was up 341 million but analysts are still questioning its growth potential. I will forever be a a holder because I still believe. But what are your guys thoughts.? Any doubts? Any concerns? Is it just a short term growth stock?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kpozn9/why_are_people_so_high_on_palantir/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kpozn9/why_are_people_so_high_on_palantir/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/nccd8v/are_we_still_high_on_pltr/","title":"Are we still high on PLTR?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-14T21:51:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-14 21:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1f26e2d1-14ca-5a10-b85e-fba5e58cb1bb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nccd8v/are_we_still_high_on_pltr/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nccd8v/are_we_still_high_on_pltr/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Cooper-N","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cooper-N","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Cooper-N","score":165,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"PLTRではまだ高いのかな？","the_new_excerpt":"私は以前、「なぜ人々はPalantirを好きなのか？という投稿をしました。\n大きな成長の可能性を秘めた革新的な企業であり、その製品は他に類を見ないというのが総意でした。\n製品が他に類を見ない革新的な企業であるということでした。以下にその投稿を残しておきます。私もPalantirを買いました。\n私もPalantirを購入しました。問題...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们对PLTR的评价还高吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我发了一个帖子，问为什么人们喜欢Palantir？大家的共识是\n大家一致认为，这是一家具有巨大发展潜力的创新公司，其产品是独一无二的。\n产品是独一无二的。我把帖子留在下面。我也买入了\nPalantir，因为我相信它有巨大的增长潜力。问题是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們對PLTR的評價還高嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我發了一個帖子，問爲什麼人們喜歡Palantir？大家的共識是\n大家一致認爲，這是一傢俱有巨大發展潛力的創新公司，其產品是獨一無二的。\n產品是獨一無二的。我把帖子留在下面。我也買入了\nPalantir，因爲我相信它有巨大的增長潛力。問題是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-537c82f8-9611-5685-8949-2c12176b68ad","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc98oq/amc_cashes_in_on_reddittrading_frenzy_with_428/","title":"AMC cashes in on Reddit-trading frenzy with $428 million share sale","date":"May 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AMC、4億2800万ドルの株式売却でReddit取引の熱狂に乗じて現金化","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"AMC通过出售4.28亿美元的股票在Reddit交易狂潮中套现","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC通過出售4.28億美元的股票在Reddit交易狂潮中套現","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-4ffd5035-9c66-58df-b0e2-6f6b68f8704a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncboq6/steve_carells_investment_tips_are_still_helpful/","title":"Steve Carell's Investment Tips are still helpful over a decade later!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 14, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"スティーブ・カレルの投資の秘訣は、10年以上経った今でも役に立つ!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"史蒂夫-卡瑞尔的投资建议在十多年后仍有帮助","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"史蒂夫-卡瑞爾的投資建議在十多年後仍有幫助","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-1f26e2d1-14ca-5a10-b85e-fba5e58cb1bb","previousId":"RedditPost-537c82f8-9611-5685-8949-2c12176b68ad","nextId":"RedditPost-4ffd5035-9c66-58df-b0e2-6f6b68f8704a","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/nccd8v/are_we_still_high_on_pltr/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
