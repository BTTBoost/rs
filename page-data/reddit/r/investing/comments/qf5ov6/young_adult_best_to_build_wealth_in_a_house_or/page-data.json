I’m less looking for advice on personal finance because i know there are better subreddits on that, but I wanted to raise conversation and see others’ insights on using a single family house as a practical vehicle for growing wealth in house equity. I’m familiar with the pros and cons of renting vs owning a home and i’ve read Rich Dad Poor Dad so no need to remind me that a home for many is actually a liability, i’m more thinking about let’s say the next 5-7 years whether it makes more sense to rent over an extended period of time and plow more money into equities or to build equity in a home by getting a mortgage. I know there’s lots of nuances to this and i consider myself to be a knowledgeable and reasonably sophisticated investor (at least with my own money) so i don’t need tips on how to allocate the difference necessarily, but the crux of my question boils down to over an intermediate 5-7 ish year time frame whether it’s more effective to build wealth generally in a diversified equities portfolio with increased marginal contributions rather than saving up for a downpayment on a house while continuing to rent, or save up for a down payment and use leverage from a mortgage to build real estate equity. Note, not looking for a house to ‘settle down’ in long term because i recognize the right house for a family has qualitative values not measurable or relevant to an investment analysis. Speaking purely from an investment stand point, i’m wondering whether a leveraged real estate investment (which is how i would think of a house if i bought one now) and all the costs associated as well as the equity in a booming real estate market compares with expected equity returns in medium term. part of my concern here is that neither stocks nor housing seem cheap, especially not in my area right now, but buying a house requires using leverage to enter a record hot asset class while continuing to rent and pouring more into stocks (in roth accounts and then taxable) feels like a more moderate decision. Would love to hear your all’s thoughts</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qf5ov6/young_adult_best_to_build_wealth_in_a_house_or/","title":"Young adult, best to build wealth in a house or rent","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-25T13:44:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-25 13:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qf5ov6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qf5ov6/young_adult_best_to_build_wealth_in_a_house_or/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qf5ov6/young_adult_best_to_build_wealth_in_a_house_or/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"somalley3","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/somalley3","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"somalley3","score":163,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ヤングアダルト、一軒家か賃貸で資産形成するのがベスト","the_new_excerpt":"22歳（男）、金融関係の仕事をしていて、今は真面目な女友達と1ベッドルームの家賃を折半しています。\n最近、自分がどれだけ中期的に家を買おうと思っているかを考えてみました。\n最近、中期的に家を買おうかどうか考えています。個人的な金融に関するアドバイスを求めているわけではありません。\nなぜなら、もっと良いサブレディットがあることを知っているからです...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"年轻的成年人，最好在房子里积累财富，或者租房子","the_new_excerpt":"22岁（男），从事金融工作，目前在一个一室一厅中与严肃的女朋友分担租金。\n我最近花了一些时间反思我是如何倾向于在中国买房的。\n我最近花了一些时间来思考我有多想在中期内真正买房。我不是在寻找个人财务方面的建议\n个人财务方面的建议，因为我知道有很多更好的子版块......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"年輕的成年人，最好在房子裏積累財富，或者租房子","the_new_excerpt":"22歲（男），從事金融工作，目前在一個一室一廳中與嚴肅的女朋友分擔租金。\n我最近花了一些時間反思我是如何傾向於在中國買房的。\n我最近花了一些時間來思考我有多想在中期內真正買房。我不是在尋找個人財務方面的建議\n個人財務方面的建議，因爲我知道有很多更好的子版塊......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qfdt8t","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qfdt8t/what_is_she_looking_at/","title":"What is she looking at?","date":"October 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"彼女は何を見ているのか？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"她在看什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"她在看什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1452604870503108612","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1452604870503108612","title":"Republican Gov.
