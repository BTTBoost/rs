To me, this looks like a long-term buy opportunity:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financials look pretty healthy from what I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.80% dividend yield is a big nice-to-have if you&amp;#39;re gonna hold the stock patiently for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;P/E ratio is one of the lowest in the tech market right now, meaning that the company has a lot of room to grow if the expectations become optimistic. And in the case of a market crash, it would be one of the safest bets in the tech market because of its healthy P/E ratio (correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong on this one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They announced an increase in capital spending for the next year, so they are likely trying to get back the ground that they&amp;#39;ve lost in their technological advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re soon going to compete in the discrete GPU market too, so that can&amp;#39;t do them any wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their own semiconductor foundries, they have an upper edge in manufacturing costs and can avoid a lot of supply chain related issues. And with the never-ending chip shortage, they might be able to make more chips at more affordable costs than AMD and Nvidia, who are bound in their production by TSMC&amp;#39;s production capacity. Surely, their manufacturing processes are not as good as TSMC and Samsung&amp;#39;s 5-7 nm processes, but it looks like they plan on catching up with them within the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They still have their place in the lower-end desktop/mobile CPU market, as their lower-end CPU&amp;#39;s are much cheaper than AMD&amp;#39;s. They offer the cheapest CPU&amp;#39;s with integrated graphics on the market right now. Even if they don&amp;#39;t grow anytime soon, I doubt they will run out of revenue sources, especially with the chip shortage going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan would be to hold the stock for a few years and cash in those nice dividends while waiting for the stock to become a growth one. I think Intel has already reached its floor price, and it would be very unlikely that the stock price goes any lower considering that it has strong fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r6071n/intel_as_a_longterm_investment/","title":"Intel as a long-term investment?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"December 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-01T21:27:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-01 21:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r6071n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6071n/intel_as_a_longterm_investment/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6071n/intel_as_a_longterm_investment/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"SomeKindOfSorbet","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SomeKindOfSorbet","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SomeKindOfSorbet","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"長期投資としてのインテル？","the_new_excerpt":"<!--SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>私は株取引についてはかなりの初心者です。\n</p> <p>私は株取引の経験が浅いので、インテルに関して私が省略したもので、あなたが言及する価値があると思うものがあれば、遠慮なく指摘してください。\n</p> <p>インテルは、誰もが将来有望だと思っていない技術的な弱者の一人のようですね。\n</p> <p>インテルは、誰もが将来的に良い業績を上げるとは考えていない、技術的な弱者の一人のようですね・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"英特尔作为一项长期投资？","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>我对股票交易很陌生，所以\n如果你认为我遗漏了任何关于英特尔的值得一提的东西，请毫不犹豫地指出来。\n</p> <p>因此，英特尔似乎是那些科技界的弱者之一，没有人认为它将会在未来的日子里获得成功。\n弱势股之一，没有人认为它在未来会有好的表现，因为......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"英特爾作爲一項長期投資？","the_new_excerpt":"<! -- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>我對股票交易很陌生，所以\n如果你認爲我遺漏了任何關於英特爾的值得一提的東西，請毫不猶豫地指出來。\n</p> <p>因此，英特爾似乎是那些科技界的弱者之一，沒有人認爲它將會在未來的日子裏獲得成功。\n弱勢股之一，沒有人認爲它在未來會有好的表現，因爲......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r69z5l","excerpt":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey there guys, I just started analyzing\nstocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here.
