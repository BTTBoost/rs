The amount of shorting at such high interest rates combined with the very low availability of shares to short tells me two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hedge funds are desperate to hold their short positions as low as possible this quarter to minimize losses. They only plan to hold short for a very brief period of time at that cost to borrow.</li>\n<li>There is a very high likelihood some, if not most, will cover those short positions and possibly even flip to long positions July 1st as a new quarter begins.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>The down pressure of short selling is greatly diminished now by the high cost and low availability of shares and it may be entirely gone next quarter.  Is this the last dip?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The long picture is clear and this shorter window is intriguing to watch.  With few shares available to short and the high cost to borrow it could greatly accelerate the short covering that appears to be imminent.  Either way, I love the opportunity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nu5k45cbjo771.png?width=1339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b14b3ec7383577b05311accbf2ae27ecff862b0\">CLOV is #1 on Fintel&#39;s Short Squeeze Score List</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I, for one, am in.
