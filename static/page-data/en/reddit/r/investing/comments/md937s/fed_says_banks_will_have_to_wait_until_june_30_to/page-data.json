Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.</p>\n\n<p>The income-based measures <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html\">were put in place</a> as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.</p>\n\n<p>Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.</p>\n\n<p>The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&amp;P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html\">she would be comfortable</a> with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.</p>\n\n<p>At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.</p>\n\n<p>“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”</p>\n\n<p>Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/md937s/fed_says_banks_will_have_to_wait_until_june_30_to/","title":"Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-26T01:00:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-26 01:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e8913463-f5ac-570d-8ac8-a4349d1c6478","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/md937s/fed_says_banks_will_have_to_wait_until_june_30_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/md937s/fed_says_banks_will_have_to_wait_until_june_30_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Hichek2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hichek2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Hichek2","score":819,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"美联储表示，银行要等到6月30日才开始发行回购和更大的红利。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/fed-says-banks-will-have-to-wait-until-june-30-to-start-issuing-buybacks-and-bigger-dividends.html\n\n美联储表示，银行要等到6月30日才开始发行回购和\n更大红利\n\n *大银行将被允许恢复正常的派息水平... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美聯儲表示，銀行要等到6月30日纔開始發行回購和更大的紅利。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/fed-says-banks-will-have-to-wait-until-june-30-to-start-issuing-buybacks-and-bigger-dividends.html\n\n美聯儲表示，銀行要等到6月30日纔開始發行回購和\n更大紅利\n\n *大銀行將被允許恢復正常的派息水平... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-27ceb77d-ed12-5988-88d4-92ff82dd517d","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 25, 2021\n\nStocks rose on Thursday, shaking off three consecutive days of losses in yet\nanother volatile trading session.
