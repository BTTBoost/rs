I am seeing a lot of information flying around accusing brokerages of blocking retail traders from buying with the express intent of screwing retail investors. Here&#39;s another, more rational take, coming from an associate of mine who works on Wall Street:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the US, there is one central securities depository called the Depository Trust Company (DTC).</li>\n<li>When you buy a stock on your broker, they take the order to DTC. DTC fills the order by finding a seller. The same thing happens when a hedge fund wants to buy securities, or a bank.</li>\n<li>However, there is risk associated with matching a buyer to a seller. To mitigate this risk, there is something called the &quot;settlement cycle&quot;</li>\n<li>The settlement cycle is a 2-day holding period where the buyer (in this case, your broker) puts down a clearing fund deposit to collateralize the transaction. After the two days, they get the deposit back.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s happening here?</p>\n\n<p>The clearing fund deposit that buyers have to submit is adjusted based on market volatility. Because of the volatility surrounding $GME, $AMC, and these other stocks, the clearinghouses/DTC are requiring firms to front excessively high collateral in order to buy shares of these companies.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these brokers simply just may not have the cash on hand to front the collateral to fulfill the massive influx of buy orders incoming for these stocks. So they suspended accepting buy orders for the stocks. They kept the option of selling open, because they have a fiduciary duty towards their customers. Their actions are a byproduct of not having enough money to fulfill the orders.</p>\n\n<p>Why can hedge funds and big banks buy then? Because they have plenty of cash lying around! And if they don&#39;t, they can borrow it from each other. Because of this, they don&#39;t have to worry about being locked out of the markets due to volatility.</p>\n\n<p>In summary: please don&#39;t jump to conclusions and assume bad faith before it is proven. There are lots of people here and on <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">/r/wallstreetbets</a> who have been &quot;investors&quot; for less than 2 weeks and don&#39;t understand how everything works. Let&#39;s keep a cool head and not make accusations which we can&#39;t prove. That goes for everyone, including those in the media. Thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l7hwll/why_isnt_your_broker_letting_you_buy_its_probably/","title":"Why isn't your broker letting you buy?
