Today, between Evergrande, crypto, and lord knows what else, there are plenty of reasons for uncertainty. I don&#39;t have an investing diary, exactly, but I have a pretty good account of my own investor sentiment since I started investing in 2013. My approach was Bogle-inspired, although as I note, I shifted a bit (often for bad reasons). I thought I might share them, as a good representation of timing the market, as well as illustrating other cognitive biases one might have (e.g. the way we can become overcommitted to a strategy once we have emotionally invested in it). </p>\n\n<p>January 2015: I started to get worried when the Shiller forward P/E went above 25, the level it was before the 2008 financial crisis. I have generally fretted about this, and the Buffet indicator (market cap: GDP) since then. I did shift my portfolio from being 100% domestic to include international index funds at this point (not that it did any good).  </p>\n\n<p>November 2016: I thought Trump winning the 2016 election would tank the markets (actually it did briefly upset overnight futures markets). It didn&#39;t, of course. Rather, the market boomed. </p>\n\n<p>October 2017: I still remember the cover of The Economist. &quot;The bull market in everything&quot;. I was sure that there was something afoot. There would be a few subsequent moments that felt like &quot;now it&#39;s about to start&quot;. In February 2018 the VIX surged as the trade war accelerated and the Fed raised rates above 1%. There <em>was</em> (and this points to the difficulty of timing) a sharp correction in December 2018, but the market almost immediately recovered.    </p>\n\n<p>August 2019: the yield curve inverted, and once again I began to thought that the end was nigh. There was going to be a recession and that was it. The rise of the S&amp;P 500 into early 2020 felt suspicious to me. Arguably, this is the one time my gut might have been right. <em>But</em> I was right for the wrong reasons. The crash of 2020 was caused by the pandemic, which I obviously hadn&#39;t considered in August 2019 (nor even in January 2020). </p>\n\n<p>March 9, 2020: now, those were crazy times my friend. Some days were up double-digits and some were down by the same. It was circuit breaker city, man. Critically though, the signs of a financial crisis were there - repo markets were drying up and even treasuries were dropping.On March 9th I came damn close to shifting large amounts of my portfolio into bonds. I still have the trade confirmation, though I stopped it at the last second. The S&amp;P 500 had fallen to something like 2800.  </p>\n\n<p>April 9, 2020: I held through the bottom, when a strange thing started happening. The market recovered very rapidly. In a few days the S&amp;P 500 was up from a low of something in the 2200s to almost 2800. I thought there was no way it could keep going like this. I remember looking at graphs (which people were posting widely at the time) showing the market through the Great Depression. One of the striking takeaways was that it hadn&#39;t just been down down down followed by recovery. There were so many bear traps. Could this be one of them? It was at this point that I broke from Bogle advice. As the market recovered, I shifted modest amounts into bonds reasoning that when the real bottom appeared I would buy everything cheap. A completely irrational factor in my move: relatives bragging that they saw the crash coming and pulled everything out just in time. </p>\n\n<p>June 6, 2020: as my fear of bear traps receded, I reverted back to my long-term optimal portfolio. One day later, the market saw the biggest crash since the heady days of March. A-ha! I thought. It turns out I was right all along. And <em>of course</em> I was - unemployment had just hit the highest levels since the Great Depression, some states were prematurely reopening from the pandemic, etc. I didn&#39;t sell everything, but I maintained an overly bond-heavy portfolio for my age (mid-30s). As the market rose further in July and August, I continued to shift assets to bonds (I also shifted my bond holdings to TIPS which did work out... so far). </p>\n\n<p>September 2020: through August I had read the story about Softbank&#39;s sometimes insane bets on tech, and was again sure that a crash was nigh. I felt bearish - one day I went running in the woods and literally saw a family of black bears crossing the road. And indeed, the S&amp;P 500 started to correct (the Nasdaq somewhat more). And yet... pretty soon after, it was back to normal. </p>\n\n<p>January 22, 2021: this story involves my active trading account, which represents a very small proportion of my investments. When GME started to surge to $65 (vs. $4 in August 2020) following the beginnings of the campaign on Wall Street Bets, I was sure that the stock would fall. I bought OTM puts. When it rose more, I bought more OTM puts - and I even was able to time the peak correctly the second time. Obviously, the first set of puts became worthless, but interestingly, so did the second because I had bought them when volatility was so high that the stock would have to hit ridiculously low levels for my puts to print.      </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure that there are other folks out there who are better investors than I. Maybe they have the time to do research and find diamonds in the rough. Maybe they have the discipline to avoid going double or nothing (and to resist confirmation bias) when their theses prove false. And hey, maybe they are smarter and possessed of some abilities that I lack. But I would have to say that the smartest thing I&#39;ve ever done is to ignore my instincts, saved, diversified, and waited.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qr7hcg/market_timing_diary_how_a_regular_guy_like_you/","title":"Market timing diary: how a regular guy like you predicted 9 of the last 1 crashes","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T01:45:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 01:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qr7hcg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qr7hcg/market_timing_diary_how_a_regular_guy_like_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qr7hcg/market_timing_diary_how_a_regular_guy_like_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"radagast_the_owned","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/radagast_the_owned","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"radagast_the_owned","score":229,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"マーケット・タイミング・ダイアリー：過去1回の大暴落のうち9回を、あなたのような普通の人がどうやって予測したか","the_new_excerpt":"定期的に、市場に疑問を持つ人の投稿がここに寄せられます。\n今日、Evergrande、暗号、そして他にも何かあるかもしれませんが、不安な理由はたくさんあります。\n不安な理由がたくさんあります。私は正確には投資日記を持っていませんが、自分の投資家としての感情をかなり把握しています。\n私は投資日記を持っていませんが、投資を始めてからの自分の投資家としての感情をかなり把握しています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"市场时机日记：像你这样的普通人如何预测了过去1次崩盘中的9次","the_new_excerpt":"我们定期在这里收到对市场有疑问的人的帖子。\n今天，在恒大、加密货币和天知道其他什么之间，有很多的\n不确定性的原因。确切地说，我没有投资日记，但我有一个\n但我对自己的投资者情绪有很好的记录，因为我开始......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場時機日記：像你這樣的普通人如何預測了過去1次崩盤中的9次","the_new_excerpt":"我們定期在這裏收到對市場有疑問的人的帖子。\n今天，在恆大、加密貨幣和天知道其他什麼之間，有很多的\n不確定性的原因。確切地說，我沒有投資日記，但我有一個\n但我對自己的投資者情緒有很好的記錄，因爲我開始......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qr0gsr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qr0gsr/rivian_gain_porn_16_min_and_18456/","title":"Rivian Gain Porn. 16 min and $18,456 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","date":"November 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"リビアン・ゲイン・ポルノ 16分・18,456円 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Rivian Gain Porn. 16分钟和18,456美元 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Rivian Gain Porn. 16分鐘和18,456美元 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qr6lxi","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 10, 2021\n\nThe dizzying rally in the stock market came to a screeching halt following the\nrelease of a key inflation report that showed a greater than expected jump in\nconsumer prices despite new jobless claims coming in at a pandemic-era low.
