The announcement says “Li Yonghe, president of urban retail business group, and HRG Xu Kun take the blame and resign. Alibaba chief human resources officer Tong Wenhong gets recorded for punishment. The suspected male employee is dismissed and will never be hired again. As to whether he is guilty, the police are investigating and collecting evidence.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Earlier, it was reported that a female employee of Alibaba was arranged for a business trip and was asked by her direct leader Wang Chengwen to drink wine with merchants. She was assaulted after being drunk. Then, Wang Chengwen went in and out of the female employee&#39;s hotel room four times late at night and raped her. She reported it to Alibaba HR and relevant person in charge but got no results. In the end, the victim went to Alibaba’s public cafeteria to hand out flyers to defend her rights.</p>\n\n<p>In the early morning of August 8, Zhang Yong posted a post on Alibaba&#39;s intranet, expressing his feelings about the incident with words such as shock, anger, and shame. At the same time, he said that he must investigate clearly and give an explanation to all employees and the whole society.</p>\n\n<p>On the evening of August 8, there was a letter titled &quot;Aliren help Aliren: a joint initiative of 6000 Alirens on the 807 incident&quot; forwarded on social media. “Aliren” means people of Alibaba. It stated that Alibaba employees have spontaneously established a discussion group called the &quot;Brave Cattle Help Group&quot;, which will use the above incidents to promote the establishment of an anti-sexual harassment/anti-sexual assault system for employees, especially female employees.</p>\n\n<p>As of the close of trading on August 6, Alibaba&#39;s US stock price was US$196.39, a decrease of 1.45%. As of press time, Alibaba&#39;s Hong Kong stock price is 190.1 Hong Kong dollars, a decline of 1.76%.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p0tnl3/in_response_to_female_employee_being_violated/","title":"In response to \"female employee being violated\", Alibaba announces its decision","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-09T09:41:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-09 09:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"44ac1b74-af5c-53df-89b7-7ecb34100c00","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p0tnl3/in_response_to_female_employee_being_violated/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p0tnl3/in_response_to_female_employee_being_violated/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"InsurViewChina","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/InsurViewChina","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"InsurViewChina","score":154,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"女性社員が暴力を受けている」ことを受けて、アリババが決断を発表","the_new_excerpt":"8月9日早朝、アリババの会長兼CEOである張勇は、「アリババ。\n8月9日早朝、アリババの会長兼CEOである張勇は、「アリババの女性従業員が\nアリババの女性従業員がビジネスディナー中にワインを飲まされ、レイプされた」という事件の内部調査結果と決定を発表しました。\nを発表しました。発表では、「李永和社長が...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为回应 \"女员工被侵犯\"，阿里巴巴宣布其决定","the_new_excerpt":"8月9日凌晨，阿里巴巴董事长兼CEO张勇。\n发布了关于 \"阿里巴巴一名女员工被强暴 \"事件的内部调查结果和决定。\n阿里巴巴女员工在商务宴请中被强迫饮酒并被强奸 \"事件的内部调查结果。\n遭到强奸\"。公告称，\"李永和总裁...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲迴應 \"女員工被侵犯\"，阿里巴巴宣佈其決定","the_new_excerpt":"8月9日凌晨，阿里巴巴董事長兼CEO張勇。\n發佈了關於 \"阿里巴巴一名女員工被強暴 \"事件的內部調查結果和決定。\n阿里巴巴女員工在商務宴請中被強迫飲酒並被強姦 \"事件的內部調查結果。\n遭到強姦\"。公告稱，\"李永和總裁...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1424543236174098435","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1424543236174098435","title":"FUCK OFF https://t.co/KeyPrNGkID","date":"August 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"FUCK OFF https://t.co/KeyPrNGkID","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"滚蛋吧！https://t.co/KeyPrNGkID","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"滾蛋吧！https://t.co/KeyPrNGkID","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c1b07fbf-f998-5f21-9d26-dfe4f58de51f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p0rilf/401k_options_currently_100_in_target_date_2045/","title":"401k options - currently 100% in target date 2045.
