Total Index are heavily weighted toward large cap stocks\n• Take your age x 1.5 for your % AA to a TDF.  Example.  40 x 1.5 = 60% allocation to TDF\n• Midcap indexes are highly correlated with total stock market indexes and are therefore a poor diversifier.  You don’t need them\n• 25% max dedicated toward factor tilts\n• If you want to tilt, above all, be patient and stick to your guns.  Don’t chase returns.  Once you decide to tilt, you need to stick with that strategy and not bailout of it\n• The enemy of a good asset allocation is the quest for a perfect one.  Fight the urge to be perfect\n• Study in 1992 By Fama and French – Performance of a broadly diversified US stock portfolio relied on 3 primary risks axis to determine its return.  95% accuracy as to what the portfolio would return\no Market risk or Beta – all portfolios move up or down in relation to the total stock market\no Percent of small cap in the portfolio by weight – small stocks have higher returns and do not always have correlation to the total stock market\no Percent of value orientation – value stocks have a higher return than growth and do not correlate with growth stocks\n• Small cap value index has outperformed growth with less standard deviation from 1979-2009\no Having a 50/50 value/growth index during this time added no return and increased standard deviation\n• Small cap stocks have higher expected returns but also higher standard deviation than large cap\no This occurs in foreign markets too\n• Small Cap value along with total stock market is a good choice in your portfolio</p>\n\n<p>International</p>\n\n<p>• International equity provides currency diversification\n• Global equity invests in both US and international.  Not usually a good idea unless you have a very small amount of money want diversification from 1 fund\n• Good idea to have both US AND International equities in your portfolio at all times.  You don’t know which one will win.  US won from 1970-2001 then International has won since\n• Canada’s economy is weighted heavily toward finance, energy and basic materials.  Canada has lots of natural resources and investing in them acts as a hedge against commodity prices\n• A permanent allocation to emerging market stocks is recommended.  Emerging markets are very volatile.  Recently Emerging markets have increased their correlation to US markets but this may or may not continue\n• Generally, the allocation to international stocks is about 30% of the equity portion of your portfolio\n• Independent studies prove the size and value premium (F+F study above) works in international stocks like it does with US.  This means international small cap is a good idea too\n• Foreign stocks are subject to currency, political, trading, custody and regulatory risk.  You must understand these risks.  But they do provide diversification to a portfolio</p>\n\n<p>Fixed Income</p>\n\n<p>A diversified fixed income portfolio enhances return\n• Low-cost bond mutual funds are an ideal way to invest\n• Tax considerations may be an important element in fixed income when investing in a taxable account\n• Bond Structure\no Short – 3 years or less\no Intermediate – 4 to 9 years\no Long – 10+ years\n• Longer term bonds have higher interest rate risk.  Longer maturity = higher rates.  Opposite true\n• Lower quality bonds have higher credit risk.  Lower credit rating = higher rates.  Opposite true\n• High yield bonds have not only credit risks but the real danger that the issuers will default\n• Municipal bonds are a good choice for people in higher tax brackets in taxable accounts\nREIT\n• Real estate is a separate asset class from stocks and bonds\n• REIT are a convenient way to invest in real estate\n• REITs have low correlation with stocks and bonds\n• Nearly all commercial lease contracts have a built-in inflation hedge.  Therefore, REITs are a good inflation hedge\n• REITs are the simplest way to participate in the real estate market.  They are also liquid\n• Index Equity REITs and ETFs are a good choice\n• REITs are divided into 3 categories\no Equity – Real estate properties.  Most pure holding\no Mortgage REITs – do not own property, they finance property.  Bond investment\no Hybrid – Hold both\n• 10% allocation to REIT is enough\n• Do not include home equity in your asset allocation models\n• Equity REITs are portfolios of apartments, hotels, malls, industrial buildings, and other rental property</p>\n\n<p>Behavioral</p>\n\n<p>• Realistic expectations are important to investment planning\n• Market volatility is more predictable than market return\n• Investments with expected positive investment return and higher volatility have higher expected return\n• All investments have risk.  Even T-Bills which is inflation risk.  There is no risk-free investment\n• No more than 12 funds because it gets too complex with higher fees and diminishing returns\n• Do not change your percentage of equity/bond based on what you think the market will do.  Once you select a ratio stick with it.\n• Most people can’t stomach a 100% equity portfolio\n• A well-developed plan works only when the investor sticks to the plan through good and bad times\n• A sensible investment plan never fails an investor, the investor fails the plan\n• People tend to more optimistic about stocks after the market goes up and less after it goes down\n• Investors give too much weight to recent information\n• People tend to buy investments that have had a recent run-up in performance\n• Investors label investments good or bad depending of the price relative to where they bought it\n• People are reluctant to admit errors\n• Overconfident investors generally believe they have more knowledge and information than they actually do.  Therefore, they tend to trade too much and underperform\n• Males tend to be overconfident\n• Females tend to do better at sticking to a long-term plan and usually perform better\n• Do not change your investment strategy during a bear market\n• If you can rebalance without hesitation even during bad markets, your risk tolerance is good\n• Many portfolio failures occur when investors take on too much risk</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ob7ofq/richard_ferri_all_about_asset_allocation_and/","title":"Richard Ferri All About Asset Allocation and Protecting Your Wealth Pt 2","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"July 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-01T02:40:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-01 02:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e60f6aea-7de9-5881-b25b-6eaae3226c8f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ob7ofq/richard_ferri_all_about_asset_allocation_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ob7ofq/richard_ferri_all_about_asset_allocation_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"captmorgan50","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"captmorgan50","score":32,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"リチャード・フェリ アセットアロケーションと資産防衛のすべて Pt2","the_new_excerpt":"株式\n\n- 米国株式市場トータルファンドへの投資は、米国株式の基礎となる強固な基盤です。\n米国株式市場への配分の基礎となります。トータル・インデックスは大型株に偏っています。\n年齢×1.5でTDFへの配分率を算出します。例 40 x 1.5\n= TDFへの60%の配分 - ミッドキャップ・インデックスは高度に...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"理查德-费里关于资产配置和保护你的财富的演讲Pt 2","the_new_excerpt":"股票\n\n- 投资于整个美国股票市场的基金是一个坚实的基础。\n坚实的基础，可作为美国股市配置的基础。总指数在很大程度上偏重于\n大盘股 - 以您的年龄×1.5来计算您在TDF的AA百分比。例如。40 x 1.5\n= 60%分配给TDF - 中型股指数高度偏重于大型股。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"理查德-費裏關於資產配置和保護你的財富的演講Pt 2","the_new_excerpt":"股票\n\n- 投資於整個美國股票市場的基金是一個堅實的基礎。\n堅實的基礎，可作爲美國股市配置的基礎。總指數在很大程度上偏重於\n大盤股 - 以您的年齡×1.5來計算您在TDF的AA百分比。例如。40 x 1.5\n= 60%分配給TDF - 中型股指數高度偏重於大型股。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-177a718f-d761-5658-a76f-227d3b33f655","excerpt":"Just noticed that Newegg is realllly running up.
