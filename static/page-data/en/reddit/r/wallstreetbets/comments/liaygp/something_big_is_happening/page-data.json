Recently I began reading WSB more, commenting, etc, because it helps numb the pain of my losses and adds some good laughs. My interest in investing in $ROPE has also decreased. I just realized that in my 7 years of &quot;investing&quot;, I have never actually realized a profit. If my account had green, I&#39;d always think let&#39;s enjoy some gains just for a day or two, and then it would tank as soon as I&#39;d want to cash out a bit. This isn&#39;t even a casino at this point, I am simply just making charitable donations which are then gambled by other retards. I have even managed to lose money in real estate in Vancouver, where pretty much everyone and their wifes boyfriend has made money. </p>\n\n<p>I came to the realization that this is all a game and it could not possibly be real. The game isn&#39;t rigged, its fake! This must be a simulation. As soon as I click buy, the stock tanks, if I invest in a property the market tanks, even when I pick fruits/veggies at the market they expire instantly, when I hop in the shower the water turns freezing cold. Anyone else feel like this???</p>\n\n<p>If 2 retards who are experiencing this did the opposite of eachother, would one of them make money? Or would this possibly end the simulation as both aren&#39;t actually allowed to make money?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Thanking you guys for the advice, I am staying away from the market until I learn more, even it takes years. Enjoy the soon to come record breaking market growth!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaygp/something_big_is_happening/","title":"SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING!","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T18:18:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 18:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6d971539-4be0-5818-a244-ca8de3fc3e5f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaygp/something_big_is_happening/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaygp/something_big_is_happening/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Karn235","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Karn235","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Karn235","score":3416,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有大事发生了!","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我已经在这里潜伏了一段时间了。最近我开始多看WSB。\n评论等，因为它有助于麻痹我失去的痛苦，并增加一些好的\n的笑声。我对投资$ROPE的兴趣也下降了。我才意识到\n在我7年的 \"投资 \"中，我从未真正... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有大事發生了!","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我已經在這裏潛伏了一段時間了。最近我開始多看WSB。\n評論等，因爲它有助於麻痹我失去的痛苦，並增加一些好的\n的笑聲。我對投資$ROPE的興趣也下降了。我才意識到\n在我7年的 \"投資 \"中，我從未真正... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ada6a1df-12f1-50fa-a884-7bd8fafcfb66","excerpt":"After a 40% rally - Magnachip is now 7x EV/ EBITDA and still extremely cheap for\nthis fast growing semiconductor company focused on 5G and OLED smartphones.\n\nMagnachip Semiconductor NYSE:MX - 33% global market share in OLED display\ndrivers or DDICs (allows OLED screens to function), behind Samsung…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/li9qnq/magnachip_mx_expected_to_beat_q4_guidance/","title":"Magnachip MX Expected to Beat Q4 Guidance: Undervalued at 7x EV/EVITDA & Supplies to 5G OLED Phones / Margin Upside","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"麦格纳晶MX有望超越第四季度指引。低估7倍EV/EVITDA及供应5G OLED手机/利润率上扬。","the_new_excerpt":"在经历了40%的涨幅后--麦格纳奇现在的EV/EBITDA是7倍，而且价格仍旧非常便宜。\n这家快速成长的半导体公司专注于5G和OLED智能手机。\n\n麦格纳晶半导体NYSE:MX--在OLED显示屏领域占据33%的全球市场份额。\n驱动程序或DDIC（允许OLED屏幕运行），背后是三星...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"麥格納晶MX有望超越第四季度指引。低估7倍EV/EVITDA及供應5G OLED手機/利潤率上揚。","the_new_excerpt":"在經歷了40%的漲幅後--麥格納奇現在的EV/EBITDA是7倍，而且價格仍舊非常便宜。\n這家快速成長的半導體公司專注於5G和OLED智能手機。\n\n麥格納晶半導體NYSE:MX--在OLED顯示屏領域佔據33%的全球市場份額。\n驅動程序或DDIC（允許OLED屏幕運行），背後是三星...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ab4f46ca-32dd-5d44-8585-d28609f6a1ee","excerpt":"I have seen my favorite stock $ATOS in red for the whole week.
