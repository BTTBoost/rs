Most of my profits came from following the excellent DD on this sub, realizing I had lost nearly all of my money, and then getting really lucky playing biotech stocks right around COVID. At the height of my investing career I had turned that $5,000 into around $10,000 plus or minus $5,000.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday a realization dawned on me. I looked back at my comment history on a since deleted account and found that I had credulously bought into hundreds of plays based on TA and hype from ostensibly honest posters - people who positioned themselves as men of the people who wanted us all to succeed. I had to ask myself <em>if all of these people wanted me to succeed, why did I keep <em>losing money</em> every time I followed their advice?</em></p>\n\n<p>The realization was this: I, boy genius, had been had by a pack of charlatans. These posters were not in fact benign and kind hearted genius day traders with brilliant plays based on scientific and technical analysis. Their DD may have been long and full of many colorful charts with arrows and candles and awesome phrases; but their hearts were empty and their premises were naught but lies!</p>\n\n<p>Rather than trying to make <em>me</em> rich, they were fattening me - and people like me - up for the proverbial slaughter. Like so many suckered before me, I had nodded my head, opened my wallet, and bought whatever they told me: PLTR, AMC, NIO, GLD, SLV, AAL, the list goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Sure <em>maybe</em> my account would become turgid for a few glittering moments but it never climaxed into a blizzard of cocaine and Benjamins as the posters promised. Usually I was left watching my options bleed on the daily as the initial frenzy of interest by retail mongoloids diminished and the dumb money flooded into the next frenzied promise.. time and time again.. time and time again.</p>\n\n<p>So now that I have wizened myself to this treacherous game, I want to know. How do you identify the GOOD tips from the BAD tips. How do we know when a poster on here has the goods?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: does the wholesome award mean you think I&#39;m dumb?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oqngq7/manipulation_girls_do_it_shit_posters_do_it/","title":"Manipulation, girls do it, shit posters do it, whales even do it","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-24T16:03:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-24 16:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9d2203b1-c845-5c73-b722-5d6579392781","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oqngq7/manipulation_girls_do_it_shit_posters_do_it/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oqngq7/manipulation_girls_do_it_shit_posters_do_it/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"PayMe2Shill4U","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PayMe2Shill4U","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PayMe2Shill4U","score":5621,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"操り、女の子もやるし、糞ポスターもやるし、クジラだってやる。","the_new_excerpt":"私は経験豊富なベテラントレーダーであり、誇りを持って5,000ドルの小さな投資を\n2019年1月の投資で、5,102ドル以上の価値のある財産になったことを誇りに思っています。私のほとんどの\n私の利益のほとんどは、このサブの優れたDDに従って、私がほぼすべての資金を失っていたことに気付いたことによるものです。\n私の利益のほとんどは、このサブの優れたDDに従って、ほぼすべての資金を失ったことに気付き、その後、本当に幸運なプレー...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"操纵，女孩会这样做，屎壳郎会这样做，鲸鱼甚至会这样做","the_new_excerpt":"我是一名经验丰富的老牌交易员，他已经自豪地将2019年1月的5,000美元小额\n的投资变成了价值超过5102美元的财富。我的大部分\n我的大部分利润来自于跟随本子上的优秀DD，意识到我已经失去了\n几乎所有的钱，然后非常幸运地玩...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"操縱，女孩會這樣做，屎殼郎會這樣做，鯨魚甚至會這樣做","the_new_excerpt":"我是一名經驗豐富的老牌交易員，他已經自豪地將2019年1月的5,000美元小額\n的投資變成了價值超過5102美元的財富。我的大部分\n我的大部分利潤來自於跟隨本子上的優秀DD，意識到我已經失去了\n幾乎所有的錢，然後非常幸運地玩...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1418764001190858752","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1418764001190858752","title":"It’s a HIPAA violation to ask me about my stock picks this year","date":"July 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"私の今年の銘柄について聞くのはHIPAA違反です","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"问我今年的股票选择是违反HIPAA的。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"問我今年的股票選擇是違反HIPAA的。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-63e3f883-73f7-504b-8125-fd7f9fc8883c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/oqso0l/2_years_of_my_boglehead_journey_thoughts_in/","title":"2 years of my boglehead journey - thoughts in comments","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 24, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私のボーグルヘッドの旅の2年間 - コメントでの感想","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的博狗娱乐网址是多少之旅的2年--评论中的想法","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的博狗娛樂網址是多少之旅的2年--評論中的想法","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-9d2203b1-c845-5c73-b722-5d6579392781","previousId":"TweetPost-1418764001190858752","nextId":"RedditPost-63e3f883-73f7-504b-8125-fd7f9fc8883c","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oqngq7/manipulation_girls_do_it_shit_posters_do_it/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
