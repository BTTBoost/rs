After under performing the market and costing 1.5 percent in fees (Which ended up being about $120 a month based on my account and I was only putting in $500/month to my Roth so losing 20+ percent right off the top) I was done. Wish I had left sooner but now is the second best time. </p>\n\n<p>Roth I&#39;m thinking of going into FIPFX index target date fund 2050 expense 0.12. A little more than doing it myself by like $60 a year but will rebalance as I get older. So think it&#39;s worth it to kind of set and forget. </p>\n\n<p>I have a taxable brokerage I&#39;m moving over in kind it has LCCAX in it (the fees are crazy) I have about 14k in it with 4k unrealized. Thinking of just holding this til I need it without adding to it as will trigger a taxable event selling into something else. Most the gains have been in the last year so assuming large bit of capital gains. Not sure how to proceed with it any advice would be great. taking the money I was investing this and upping my 401k by that amount to reduce my taxable income right now (65k/year doing 20 percent into 401k now, super low cost of living so my expenses is 1200 per month with 15k safety net)</p>\n\n<p>Kind of excited to be on the boglehead journey, Hoping my funds transfer next week to start adding to my position. Any advice would be great,  I have trying to research a lot but I feel like anyone in my position should take a hard look at what the fees are really costing you long term.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ozddea/leaving_ameriprise/","title":"Leaving Ameriprise","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-06T21:18:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-06 21:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a7ca1ed0-da55-53e0-8b8d-01e8b53559c5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ozddea/leaving_ameriprise/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ozddea/leaving_ameriprise/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"SaveTheAles","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SaveTheAles","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SaveTheAles","score":115,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アメリプリーズからの撤退","the_new_excerpt":"今日、アメリプライズのファイナンシャル・アドバイザーと話をして、私が辞めることを伝えた。\n彼はあまり乗り気ではないようで、フィデリティは年に一度も私と話をしないし\n彼のように年に一度、自分のファンドがどれだけうまくいっているか話してくれないだろう、と。\n私は35歳なので、まだ積み立ての段階です。私は35歳なので、まだ蓄積段階です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"离开Ameriprise","the_new_excerpt":"我今天和我在Ameriprise的财务顾问谈了谈，让他知道我将离开。\n他似乎并不热衷于这个想法，说富达公司不会和我谈。\n他说富达公司不会像他那样每年和我谈一次，说我的基金表现如何，我已经35岁了。\n35岁，所以仍处于积累阶段。在经历了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"離開Ameriprise","the_new_excerpt":"我今天和我在Ameriprise的財務顧問談了談，讓他知道我將離開。\n他似乎並不熱衷於這個想法，說富達公司不會和我談。\n他說富達公司不會像他那樣每年和我談一次，說我的基金表現如何，我已經35歲了。\n35歲，所以仍處於積累階段。在經歷了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1423722303871913984","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1423722303871913984","title":"1.
