Crude oil sank 7.5%, its biggest daily loss in almost a year.</p>\n\n<p>Airlines, oil and gas, cruise lines, hotels and shopping malls got pounded—just as they had in February and March 2020. Grocery stores, online retailers, pharmaceuticals, technology and personal-hygiene stocks went up or held steady; they fared relatively well during last year’s panic, too.</p>\n\n<p>Past performance suddenly felt like a guarantee of future results—but investors should always remember that it isn’t.</p>\n\n<p>How similar was this Monday to last year’s pandemic panic? Eight of the 20 worst decliners in the S&amp;P 500 this time had been among those with the deepest losses last time. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UAL\">United Airlines Holdings</a> Inc., <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UAL?mod=chiclets\">UAL <strong>-0.62%</strong> </a>down 5.5% this past Monday, had fallen 66.9% between Feb. 19 and March 23, 2020. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OKE\">Oneok</a> Inc., <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/OKE?mod=chiclets\">OKE <strong>-0.96%</strong> </a>the natural-gas company, fell 5.8% on Monday and 74.5% in the 2020 decline. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NCLH\">Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings</a> Ltd. dropped 5.5% on Monday and 81.4% in last year’s Covid crash.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Among the biggest gainers: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/REGN\">Regeneron Pharmaceuticals</a> Inc., up 0.3% on Monday, after rising 13.7% in the 2020 crash; <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLX\">Clorox</a> Co. , up 0.8% on July 19 and 3.2% in last year’s rout; and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KR\">Kroger</a> Co. , up 4.3% on Monday and 5.2% in the 2020 slump.</p>\n\n<p>Then, starting on Tuesday, as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-07-21-2021-11626853787?mod=hp_lead_pos1&amp;mod=article_inline\">corporate earnings announcements elbowed Covid aside</a>, the markets reversed. Many of Monday’s winners went down, and lots of losers rose. Now, in effect, the market was expecting the post-March 2020 recovery to happen all over again.</p>\n\n<p>It was a wacky few days, and investors might be forgiven if they momentarily forgot that the past never repeats itself exactly.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a tough habit to break: We live in a world in which skill and excellence often persist and price is generally a good signal of quality. Great athletes with a “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hes-on-fire-what-nba-jams-hot-hand-reveals-about-the-power-of-streaks-11583256232?mod=article_inline\">hot hand</a>” seem to score again and again; your favorite restaurant’s food should be as tasty today as it was last month; a luxury car typically drives better than a cheap compact.</p>\n\n<p>And there’s some truth to it in the markets, too. Stocks whose earnings and prices have recently been rising tend to <a href=\"http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Elpederse/papers/ValMomEverywhere.pdf\">keep winning</a>, while those that have lately been losers often keep losing.</p>\n\n<p>But the stock market is a complex, dynamic system that doesn’t follow the rules of restaurants or cars. Investing is so competitive that history can rarely repeat for long; if any past pattern reliably recurred, so many people would pounce on it that it would soon stop working. Indeed, when the winners-keep-winning patterns reverse, they can <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.709.3262&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">deliver devastating losses</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The human habit of pretending that a rearview mirror is a crystal ball is almost incorrigible. Investors like seemingly coherent explanations of market moves, such as those the news media provides. As soon as the market stops going up, those explanations—no matter how arbitrary—<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1988-01369-001\">tend to make the new “down” world seem more likely to persist</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finance professor Meir Statman of Santa Clara University <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v56.n2.2340\">analyzed</a> more than a decade’s worth of monthly surveys of individual investors. The proportion who expected stocks to go up over the coming six months rose, on average, by 1 percentage point with every percentage-point increase in the S&amp;P 500’s returns for the prior month. It’s as if investors <a href=\"https://fac.comtech.depaul.edu/wdebondt/Publications/A_portrait.pdf\">believe the medium-term future is shaped by the short-term past</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Trying to get people to stop that behavior can backfire.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/c8pdw/\">a new study</a> in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, behavioral scientists Peter Ayton and Leonardo Weiss-Cohen of the University of Leeds and Philip Newall of Central Queensland University tested disclaimers about past investment performance on 1,600 people in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>Roughly 1,000 had at least some investing experience. In 60 rounds of the experiment, the participants chose between “Fund A” and “Fund B.” Each time, they saw each fund’s fees and its gain or loss over the prior month. Those returns varied randomly—but, on average, Fund A would outperform over time, because its fees were much lower.</p>\n\n<p>Strikingly, when many investors viewed the standard mutual-fund disclaimer that “past performance does not guarantee future results,” they chose the fund with higher fees <em>more</em> often.</p>\n\n<p>“A lot of experienced investors seem to believe that the warning won’t apply to them,” says Mr. Weiss-Cohen. “It’s maybe like they think, ‘I can make it work, because I know better.’”</p>\n\n<p>The phrase “does not guarantee future results” may cause investors to conclude—erroneously—that past performance is nonetheless a highly reliable indicator, says Mr. Newall. (<a href=\"https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/bespeneckbo/default/AFA611-Eckbo%20web%20site/AFA611-S8C-FamaFrench-LuckvSkill-JF10.pdf\">Low fees</a> are a much better indicator of future outcomes than <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.2867&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">past returns</a> are.)</p>\n\n<p>What does discourage investors from chasing historical returns, the researchers showed, is a warning: “Some people invest based on past performance, but funds with low fees have the highest future results.”</p>\n\n<p>That apparently prompts investors to make a social comparison between themselves and others. Who wants to settle for investing like “some people”? Everybody wants to “get ahead of the Joneses,” says Mr. Newall.</p>\n\n<p>So, as you watch the market on its latest wild goose chase after past performance, remember: Some people invest like that. You don’t have to.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/oq47cj/wsj_why_investors_cant_kick_the_past_performance/","title":"WSJ: Why Investors Can’t Kick the ‘Past Performance’ Habit","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"July 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-23T18:33:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-23 18:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"39816206-1f84-5e56-81cc-cb59d1579e94","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/oq47cj/wsj_why_investors_cant_kick_the_past_performance/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/oq47cj/wsj_why_investors_cant_kick_the_past_performance/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"DAB12AC","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DAB12AC","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DAB12AC","score":139,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WSJです。なぜ投資家は「過去の実績」の習慣を捨てられないのか","the_new_excerpt":"Jason Zweigが自分はBogleheadだとはっきり言ったことがあるかどうかはわかりませんが、彼は\nボーグルヘッドなんだ。\n\n彼の書いたものはすべて読みます。そして、私が聖歌隊に向かって説教しているのは、皆さんの中にもあると思いますが\nあなたもそうでしょう。しかし、ここにある記事は、なぜ\n過去のパフォーマンスを見ることが、なぜ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"华尔街日报》。为什么投资者无法摆脱 \"过去业绩 \"的习惯？","the_new_excerpt":"我不知道杰森-茨威格是否曾明确说过他是一个博格尔赫德，但他是\n一个Boglehead。\n\n我读他写的每一篇文章。我确信我是在向唱诗班宣讲，就像你们中的一些人一样。\n你们可能也是如此。但这里有一篇很好的（也很简短）文章，提醒我们为什么\n看待过去的表现不应该是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"華爾街日報》。爲什麼投資者無法擺脫 \"過去業績 \"的習慣？","the_new_excerpt":"我不知道傑森-茨威格是否曾明確說過他是一個博格爾赫德，但他是\n一個Boglehead。\n\n我讀他寫的每一篇文章。我確信我是在向唱詩班宣講，就像你們中的一些人一樣。\n你們可能也是如此。但這裏有一篇很好的（也很簡短）文章，提醒我們爲什麼\n看待過去的表現不應該是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a90eabdf-9c80-5a14-b73c-45c5444d1333","excerpt":"Hey friends, need some advice.
