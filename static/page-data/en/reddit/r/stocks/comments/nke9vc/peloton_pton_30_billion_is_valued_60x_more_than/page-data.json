This company is about 20% short, has 113 million in cash in the bank with just under 15 million in debt, has a market cap of 500 million. They have generated about 80 million over the past 2 quarters as well. We have a major catalyst still….people aren’t running to the gym. If you go to Nautilus.com you will still see everything is back ordered with 6-8 weeks estimated ship date. The accounts receivables shows near 90 million on orders.</p>\n\n<p>Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable). If NLS crushes again, which they will! (The question is what traders do with the report) PTON should use their beefy valuation to make an acquisition which would be immediately accretive to earnings for PTON. PTON is losing money and NLS is making money hands over fists. </p>\n\n<p><strong>These are just some of the 1st Quarter 2021 and some 4th Quarter 2020 highlights.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1st Quarter of 2021 Net Sales Increased 120% to $206 million, the highest quarterly sales in company history Operating Income of $39.7 million is third-highest in company history EBITDA was $40.4 million compared to $2.3 million last year</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>1st Quarter of 2021 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale securities were $113.2 million, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $26.5 million as of March 31, 2020.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Debt was $13.6 million compared to $28.4 million as of March 31, 2020.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fourth Quarter EBITDA improved by 578% to $40 million compared to same period last year</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>On a full year</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million….isnt that just 7x PE)</strong></p>\n\n<p>So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company’s history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..</p>\n\n<p>Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn’t have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities…</p>\n\n<p>Please share ideas and thoughts. Thank you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/nke9vc/peloton_pton_30_billion_is_valued_60x_more_than/","title":"Peloton (PTON 30 Billion) is valued 60x more than Nautilus (NLS 500 Million), NLS cheap or PTON expensive?
