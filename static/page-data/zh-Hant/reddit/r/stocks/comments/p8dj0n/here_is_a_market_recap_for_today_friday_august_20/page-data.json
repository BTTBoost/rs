Market participants continue to weigh several factors affecting the market, including but not limited to (1) the taper timeline, (2) record-breaking corporate earnings, (3) and surging coronavirus delta variant infections. </p>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rose 0.79% today, recovering earlier losses, but finished the week 0.31% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.04% today and staged a remarkable comeback this week, coming from 2% down Thursday to finishing 0.01% higher. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.65% today but finished the week 0.96% down, underperforming the other two major indexes. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.68% today but finished the week 1.98% down.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” </p>\n\n<p>In order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, “A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.”</p>\n\n<p>Read the full meeting minutes here: <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>As of yesterday, 91% of companies in the SPY have reported Q2 earnings, with 87% of these topping consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “In an earnings season with many surprises – including the highest frequency of EPS [earnings per share] beats in our 22-year data history – one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470”</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. now has an average of 143,827 new COVID-19 cases per day as of yesterday, a rate that has doubled in a little over two weeks, the number of hospitalized is at a six month high, and roughly 911 people are dying each day, triple the death rate seen in late July. For context, the US was averaging roughly 20,000 new cases per day on July 1.</p>\n\n<p>However, while this is definitely not good, it is important to mention that cases remain highly concentrated in areas of high vaccine hesitancy. According to John Hopkins University, almost ⅓ of all COVID hospitalizations in the US are in Texas or Florida. </p>\n\n<p>According to data analysis by the Associated Press using data through May 2021, shows that 98.9% of those hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated (only 1,200 of 107,000 hospitalizations as of May 2021). Dr. Rochelle Wolensky, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said “There is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The price of digital currencies surged after Coinbase (COIN) announced it was investing $500 million and would allocate 10% of quarterly profits into a digital currency portfolio. </li>\n<li>Yesterday was Tesla AI Day, in which the company unveiled new technologies and ideas the company is working on. Among the most interesting was a humanoid robot that will be operated using Tesla’s full-self driving technology (FSD). The robot is designed to do “dangerous, repetitive, boring tasks” according to Elon Musk. Interesting to say the least.</li>\n<li>Microsoft (MSFT) boosted the price of Office 365 for the first time since the service was launched a decade ago. This caused the surge to spike to a new all-time high. The company said collaboration tools now used by more than 250 million monthly active users</li>\n<li>After 70 years, the MLB dropped Topps as the creator of the iconic baseball cards. As a result, Topps merger into the market was terminated a day before shareholders were set to vote.</li>\n<li>Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued beasting after smashing earnings and raising guidance moving forward. I love this stock so much</li>\n<li>Shares of Alibaba (BABA) continue to bleed among the regulatory crackdown by the Chinese Communist Party. The stock is now way below even March 2020 level and is trading at the lowest level since June 2019.</li>\n<li>Facebook (FB) unveiled a new product called “Horizon Workrooms”, which is a VR powered, remote work app that uses the company Oculus Rift headset. Zuckerberg called it the first step in building a “metaverse”, which is a collectively-shared virtual space where people are able to interact using avatars. This seems like the next big trend among giant internet companies.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>AbbVie (ABBV) target raised by SVB Leerink from $145 to $148 at Outperform.
