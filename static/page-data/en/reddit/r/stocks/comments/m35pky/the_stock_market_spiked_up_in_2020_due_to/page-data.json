Note: I&#39;m not an economist, so I don&#39;t have all the details, but I believe the main idea is correct. I&#39;d love to hear other perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>First, definition of <strong>inflation</strong> from Wikipedia:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In economics, inflation (or less frequently, price inflation) is a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We experienced high inflation in 2020 due to LOW interest rates. There was high demand for money, but the supply of money was increased even more (M3 increased by almost 25% in 2020) due to increased debt at low interest rates. This increased <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply\">supply of money, or debt,</a> caused spike in prices of stocks, materials, real estates, etc. Items that don&#39;t get consumed more when people have more money weren&#39;t affected as much.</p>\n\n<p>Prices started to go down this year as interest rates rose. Now that interest rates seem to be kept down and more stimulus are coming, I believe there will be rise in inflation again and stock prices will grow. I don&#39;t know if it will be as much as 2020 though.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, the stimulus and increased debt helped those in need in the short-term, but it made wealth building assets more out of reach to the poor, and at the expense of people saving cash. Unless interest rates rise and bring down prices, I believe the gap between asset owners and the poor will continue to increase, along with inflation and more debt. How long that will be sustainable, I have no idea.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m35pky/the_stock_market_spiked_up_in_2020_due_to/","title":"The stock market spiked up in 2020 due to inflation, and it will continue to grow because of it","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T06:27:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 06:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b1accc64-d439-59ab-83fd-59a46442df9d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m35pky/the_stock_market_spiked_up_in_2020_due_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m35pky/the_stock_market_spiked_up_in_2020_due_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"cspr1980","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cspr1980","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cspr1980","score":68,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2020年股市因通胀而暴涨，并将因此而继续增长。","the_new_excerpt":"来自媒体的声明称，由于通胀担忧如何被抑制，由于\n降低利率，以及通胀如何导致成长股的下跌，都没有让人感到意外。\n感。\n\n这就是为什么... 注：我不是一个经济学家，所以我没有所有的细节，但我...\n相信主旨是正确的。我很想听听其他...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2020年股市因通脹而暴漲，並將因此而繼續增長。","the_new_excerpt":"來自媒體的聲明稱，由於通脹擔憂如何被抑制，由於\n降低利率，以及通脹如何導致成長股的下跌，都沒有讓人感到意外。\n感。\n\n這就是爲什麼... 注：我不是一個經濟學家，所以我沒有所有的細節，但我...\n相信主旨是正確的。我很想聽聽其他...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2796a707-2202-54f1-9db8-b7df7d9425c4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m36r8m/had_to_do_it/","title":"Had to do it","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不得不这么做","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不得不這麼做","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6502e0ba-c12a-5e48-a9ba-4fb5ac1ef7b6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m31sm8/the_only_true_way_to_buy_gme_is_to_buy_it_on_a/","title":"The only true way to buy $GME is to buy it on a video game console in a virtual world.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 12, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"唯一真正的购买$GME的方法是在虚拟世界的电子游戏机上购买。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"唯一真正的購買$GME的方法是在虛擬世界的電子遊戲機上購買。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-b1accc64-d439-59ab-83fd-59a46442df9d","previousId":"RedditPost-2796a707-2202-54f1-9db8-b7df7d9425c4","nextId":"RedditPost-6502e0ba-c12a-5e48-a9ba-4fb5ac1ef7b6","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m35pky/the_stock_market_spiked_up_in_2020_due_to/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
