I have 175 shares of a stock. According to my TDA account my trade price for those shares is $14.35. The stock is currently trading at $7.35 so I am thinking I want to sell 75 shares and take the loss to offset some gains I made this year collecting premiums from selling CC&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>I am trying to understand the wash sale rule though. Investopedia says &quot;a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss  and within 30 days of the sale (either before or after), you purchase  the same—or a &quot;substantially identical&quot;—investment.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The &quot;either before of after&quot; part has me a little confused though. If I refrain from re-buying shares of this ticker until December I should avoid a wash sale in the after section. When it comes to the before part, I bought 4 shares @ $10.38 on 10/4, 9 shares @ $9.18 on 10/12, and 1 share @ 10.10 on 10/20. Would those purchases in any way be considered a wash sale or would my selling 75 shares today be enough to record the loss against my gains for the year as long as I don&#39;t rebuy shares for 30 days?</p>\n\n<p>I hope I&#39;ve explained this adequately. Thank you in advance for your responses.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qiia5e/selling_for_a_loss_wash_sale_question/","title":"Selling for a loss / Wash sale question","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-30T00:37:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-30 00:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qiia5e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qiia5e/selling_for_a_loss_wash_sale_question/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qiia5e/selling_for_a_loss_wash_sale_question/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"BB_Captain","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BB_Captain","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BB_Captain","score":83,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"損をしても売れる／洗車販売の質問","the_new_excerpt":"私は、今年3000ドルほどで非IRA口座を開設した小口投資家です。\n今年は3000ドルほどで非IRA口座を開設した小口投資家なので、自分で学びながら進めています。\n\nさて、以下のようなシナリオがあります。私はある銘柄を175株持っています。TDAの口座によると\n口座によると、その株の取引価格は14.35ドルです。その株は現在\n7.35ドルで取引されているので、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"亏损销售/清洗销售问题","the_new_excerpt":"我只是一个小投资者，今年开了一个非IRA账户，有大约3000美元可以玩。\n今年，我正在边学边做。\n\n好吧，情况是这样的。我有175股的股票。根据我的TDA\n我的账户，这些股票的交易价格是14.35美元。该股票目前的\n交易价格为7.35美元，所以我是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"虧損銷售/清洗銷售問題","the_new_excerpt":"我只是一個小投資者，今年開了一個非IRA賬戶，有大約3000美元可以玩。\n今年，我正在邊學邊做。\n\n好吧，情況是這樣的。我有175股的股票。根據我的TDA\n我的賬戶，這些股票的交易價格是14.35美元。該股票目前的\n交易價格爲7.35美元，所以我是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qigtuw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qigtuw/so_when_will_we_rename_faang/","title":"So when will we rename FAANG?","date":"October 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"では、いつになったらFAANGの名前を変えるのか？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"那么，我们什么时候才能给FAANG重新命名？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"那麼，我們什麼時候才能給FAANG重新命名？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1454240064343511040","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1454240064343511040","title":"RT @zerohedge: Lincoln Project Democrat Operatives Busted For White Nationalist Hoax https://t.co/fuPm4ZBG9c","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 30, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: リンカーンプロジェクト 民主党の工作員が白人国家主義者のデマで逮捕 https://t.co/fuPm4ZBG9c","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"リンカーンプロジェクト 民主党の工作員が白人国家主義者のデマで逮捕 https://t.co/fuPm4ZBG9c"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: 林肯计划的民主党人因白人民族主义的骗局而被逮捕 https://t.co/fuPm4ZBG9c","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"林肯计划民主党行动者因白人民族主义的骗局而被逮捕 https://t.co/fuPm4ZBG9c"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: 林肯計劃的民主黨人因白人民族主義的騙局而被逮捕 https://t.co/fuPm4ZBG9c","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"林肯計劃民主黨行動者因白人民族主義的騙局而被逮捕 https://t.co/fuPm4ZBG9c"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qiia5e","previousId":"RedditPost-qigtuw","nextId":"TweetPost-1454240064343511040","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qiia5e/selling_for_a_loss_wash_sale_question/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
