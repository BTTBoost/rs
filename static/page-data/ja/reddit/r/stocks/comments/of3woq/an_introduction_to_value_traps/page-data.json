The purpose of this post is to shed light on issues with some of wall streets common ratios with profitable but shrinking, deceiving or problematic businesses.</p>\n\n<p>A value trap is when a company looks like a great deal now, but in the past it has had strong fundamentals and the market has never realized this. It&#39;s hard to spot a value trap from one or even 5 years of fundamentals. Most become obvious after 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>This happens for a number of reasons. There could be underlying business problems that are not reflected in the current financials like the phasing out of an industry. The company could also lack competitive advantages and are expected to fall father behind in years to come.</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at Macy&#39;s (NYSE:M)</p>\n\n<p>There are some obvious ways to fall into this trap. You could look at average earnings ad revenue, and compare it to the current market cap. Wow! pretty obvious discount. Average book value has been pretty good too.</p>\n\n<p>But looking deeper into factors that are not as integrated into the common ratios like massively decreasing operating cash flows. The market outlook for departments stores has been very negative, thus creating a temporary value trap before Macy&#39;s business starts to really deteriorate.</p>\n\n<p>(NYSE:SNEX)</p>\n\n<p>One interesting case study is StoneX. They have massive revenues that show up on screeners and financial data websites, but in reality the revenue is recognized through their sales of commodities that are bought and sold StoneX, creating a net revenue from this operation of almost zero when accounting for the capital expenditures for these commodities. This is an example of a deceiver.</p>\n\n<p>These are just some thoughts I have. They may not align with your opinions or they may be outright wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://macrotrends.net/\">macrotrends.net</a> to quickly look at long term data, but sometimes their data it completely wrong so you can&#39;t completely rely on them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Astronomer_Soft/\">u/Astronomer_Soft</a> made a great note on some common fundamentals that value traps have:</p>\n\n<p>Easiest way to spot a value trap. Usually has many of these factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Generous dividend payout greater than free cash flow.</li>\n<li>Recent history of declining revenues, profit margins and market share.</li>\n<li>Lackluster management spouting off nonsense about unrealistic turnaround, restructuring, or acquisition plans.</li>\n<li>Extremely low return on capital employed (soon to be addressed by massive write-offs of overvalued assets on the balance sheet)</li>\n<li>Increasing debt, while financing costs of new debt is increasing and maturities getting shorter.</li>\n<li>Reverse split to maintain minimum stock price for listing requirements.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/of3woq/an_introduction_to_value_traps/","title":"An introduction to value traps","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-07T13:04:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-07 13:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dd20de2f-faf4-5b5b-974a-a1e187c657f2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/of3woq/an_introduction_to_value_traps/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/of3woq/an_introduction_to_value_traps/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"valuescott","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/valuescott","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"valuescott","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"バリュートラップの紹介","the_new_excerpt":"この記事を必要としない人もいるでしょうが、絶対に必要な人もいるはずです。この記事の目的は\nこの記事は、ウォール街の一般的な比率のいくつかの問題に光を当てることです。\nこの記事の目的は、収益性はあるが縮小している、騙している、または問題のある企業に対するウォールストリートの一般的な比率の問題を明らかにすることです。\n\nバリュートラップとは、ある企業が今はお買い得に見えるが、過去には...というものです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"价值陷阱介绍","the_new_excerpt":"你们中有些人不需要这个帖子，但有些人肯定需要。这个帖子的目的\n本帖的目的是阐明华尔街一些常见比率的问题，这些比率包括\n盈利但萎缩、欺骗或有问题的企业。\n\n价值陷阱是指当一家公司现在看起来是一笔好买卖，但在过去...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"價值陷阱介紹","the_new_excerpt":"你們中有些人不需要這個帖子，但有些人肯定需要。這個帖子的目的\n本帖的目的是闡明華爾街一些常見比率的問題，這些比率包括\n盈利但萎縮、欺騙或有問題的企業。\n\n價值陷阱是指當一家公司現在看起來是一筆好買賣，但在過去...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3bba2add-8e12-5336-b853-59d88f1e7433","excerpt":"Is the 60:40 allocation still valid?\n\nor should be adjusted intelligently","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ofcpz8/feeling_stupid_maintaining_40_vxus_while_vti_has/","title":"Feeling stupid maintaining 40% VXUS, while VTI has been up like crazy these years (these 10+years I mean)","date":"July 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"VTIがここ数年（つまりここ10年以上）、ものすごく上昇しているのに、VXUSを40％も維持しているのは馬鹿げている。","the_new_excerpt":"60：40の配分はまだ有効ですか？\n\nそれとも賢く調整すべきか","locale":"ja"},{"title":"感觉自己很傻，维持40%的VXUS，而VTI这些年（我指的是这10多年）一直在疯狂地上涨。","the_new_excerpt":"60:40的分配方式是否仍然有效？\n\n还是应该智能调整","locale":"zh"},{"title":"感覺自己很傻，維持40%的VXUS，而VTI這些年（我指的是這10多年）一直在瘋狂地上漲。","the_new_excerpt":"60:40的分配方式是否仍然有效？\n\n還是應該智能調整","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-66097772-6f8c-5cd7-a150-de94edc6dfee","excerpt":"Put my 57,000 in Savings, place all in Vanguard SP500?\n\nI have been placing about 2,000 a month into Vanguard.
