Over and over, the Sec of Energy and President himself have stressed they want US-based companies to reap the fiscal initiatives. They are a E-bus company, not passenger vehicles. They&#39;re not wasting capital trying to edge out TSLA, F, GM, VW, etc. They know their niche, they are the main player in it, and it&#39;s about to get big fiscal tailwinds for this.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Municipalities aren&#39;t just buying this to show how &quot;green&quot; they are. EV busses promise to dramatically reduce preventative and corrective maintenance over the lifetime. If the Feds are fiscally rewarding you for making this switch, why wouldn&#39;t they go this route over renewing ICE busses 100% on their own dime?</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>The odd pump-and-dump you see from a few months ago was when it was a S*AC at the height of those pump-and-dumps, and it entered into an agreement with Proterra (it&#39;s no longer a S*AC).
