I commented that they should post this here and they gave me permission to do so.  I have seen this paper referenced a number of times on this sub so I&#39;m curious to hear peoples&#39; thoughts on this rebuttal.  I have no personal bias one way or the other, just curiosity.</p>\n\n<p>You may have seen this paper (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701</a>) floating around various investment subreddits over the past week. It usually comes with the title How to 3x the S&amp;P CAGR with less risk | Leverage for the Long Run with people praising it as an amazing new strategy that requires little effort, provides a high degree of safety, and allows you to experience only the good side of leveraged ETFs. Here&#39;s why it&#39;s complete bullshit.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen the 200 SMA argument posted hundreds of times before in <a href=\"/r/LETFs\">r/LETFs</a>. I&#39;m glad this one at least comes with a paper, but the paper is still falling for the same mistakes other believers fall for. The author is correct that volatility increases below any significant moving average (20/50/100/200), however, avoiding volatility should not be your main concern when holding unhedged leveraged ETFs. Your main concern should be flash crashes like in 1987 where the market fell 22% in one day. The author says this:</p>\n\n<p>Chart 6 shows that historically, the worst 1% of trading days have occurred far more often than not below the Moving Average. Included in this list are the two worst days in market history: October 19th in 1987 and October 28th in 1929</p>\n\n<p>Wow look at that, moving averages helped avoid the worst two days... but why? The answer is partially due to the fact that both the best and worst days will be in periods of high volatility, but it&#39;s also heavily influenced by pure chance. A day like Black Monday could happen at anytime and if there wasn&#39;t a choppy market leading up to it you will miss it with moving averages. An unleveraged 22% drop would be a 66% drop for the portfolio suggested in the paper. The market would then likely dip below the 200 SMA and the person would sell! Missing the entire ride back up, even if there was more to fall you&#39;re not going to be left in a good place.</p>\n\n<p>There is no macroeconomic reason that moving averages have any form of predictive power. The closest thing would be the concept of a self fulfilling prophecy which would require a massive audience of believers to have an impact (there are not nearly enough). People always use 200 SMA, but if you try to test other SMAs nearby you sometimes get significantly worse results. The 200 SMA just happens to get you out before the Dot Com crash as well as the GFC. When your entire reasoning is based on well it did good in the past you&#39;re overfitting by definition.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at another strategy that has an economic backing - HFEA. Holding stocks and bonds together isn&#39;t something that just happens to work when you test it. When stocks experience uncertainty large investors move their money into the safety of bonds which forces them in the opposite direction to the stock. Stocks and bonds are slightly, but not perfectly inversely correlated and both of them have positive expected returns. This is why they are the ideal hedge.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to point out that this is not an academic paper that came from a university. It was published by <a href=\"https://www.leadlagreport.com/\">https://www.leadlagreport.com/</a> which says on its homepage &quot;Consistently win in the stock market and minimize risk regardless of market conditions&quot; followed by a subscribe button. This is called bullshit and I encourage anyone who cares about honesty to call it out when shit like this is posted.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r0e4ie/this_paper_has_been_going_around_investing/","title":"\"This paper has been going around investing subreddits and it is complete BS - here's why\" (not OC)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-23T15:27:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-23 15:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r0e4ie","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r0e4ie/this_paper_has_been_going_around_investing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r0e4ie/this_paper_has_been_going_around_investing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"caesar____augustus","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/caesar____augustus","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"caesar____augustus","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"This paper has been going around investing subreddits and it is complete BS - here's why\" (not OC)","the_new_excerpt":"注：これは、r/stocks [/r/stocks]やその他の類似したサブレディットに投稿された\nこのサブから追放された「かもしれない」ユーザーによって投稿されたものです（追放の理由は示されていません）。I\n私は、この論文をここに掲載すべきだとコメントし、彼らは私にそれを許可しました。\n私はこの論文がこのサイトで何度も参照されているのを見ました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"这篇论文一直在投资子网站上流传，它完全是胡说八道--这就是原因\"（不是OC）。","the_new_excerpt":"注：这是在r/stocks [/r/stocks]和其他类似的subreddits上发布的，由一名\n用户 \"可能是也可能不是 \"被禁止进入这个子网站（没有给出禁止的原因）。I\n我评论说，他们应该在这里发布这篇文章，而且他们允许我这样做。\n我已经看到这篇论文在这上面被引用了很多次...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"這篇論文一直在投資子網站上流傳，它完全是胡說八道--這就是原因\"（不是OC）。","the_new_excerpt":"注：這是在r/stocks [/r/stocks]和其他類似的subreddits上發佈的，由一名\n用戶 \"可能是也可能不是 \"被禁止進入這個子網站（沒有給出禁止的原因）。I\n我評論說，他們應該在這裏發佈這篇文章，而且他們允許我這樣做。\n我已經看到這篇論文在這上面被引用了很多次...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r0d01y","excerpt":"CNBC\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/biden-says-us-will-tap-strategic-petroleum-reserve-as-gas-prices-hover-around-7-hear-high.html]:\n\n * \"President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the administration will tap the\n   Strategic Petroleum Reserve as part of a global effort from energy-consuming\n   nations…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r0d01y/us_to_release_oil_from_reserves_in_coordination/","title":"U.S. to release oil from reserves in coordination with other countries to lower gas prices","date":"November 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"米国、ガス価格低下のために他国と協調して埋蔵量から原油を放出へ","the_new_excerpt":"CNBC\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/biden-says-us-will-tap-strategic-petroleum-reserve-as-gas-prices-hover-around-7-hear-high.html]:\n\n * ジョー・バイデン大統領は、エネルギー消費を抑制する世界的な取り組みの一環として、戦略石油備蓄を活用することを発表しました。\n   エネルギー消費国の世界的な取り組みの一環として、戦略的石油備蓄を活用すると述べた。\n   各国の","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国将与其他国家协调释放储备的石油以降低天然气价格","the_new_excerpt":"CNBC\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/biden-says-us-will-tap-strategic-petroleum-reserve-as-gas-prices-hover-around-7-hear-high.html]。\n\n *\"总统乔-拜登周二表示，政府将动用战略石油储备，作为全球努力摆脱能源消耗的一部分。\n   战略石油储备，作为能源消费国的全球努力的一部分。\n   国家的努力的一部分......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國將與其他國家協調釋放儲備的石油以降低天然氣價格","the_new_excerpt":"CNBC\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/biden-says-us-will-tap-strategic-petroleum-reserve-as-gas-prices-hover-around-7-hear-high.html]。\n\n *\"總統喬-拜登週二表示，政府將動用戰略石油儲備，作爲全球努力擺脫能源消耗的一部分。\n   戰略石油儲備，作爲能源消費國的全球努力的一部分。\n   國家的努力的一部分......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qzpaxj","excerpt":"I wanted to validate that I'm not totally wrong in thinking:\n\nright now, nobody wants bonds. not thousandires, not millionaires, not\nbillionaires with tons of cash to park who just want to earn a few bucks (hedge\nagainst inflation) and forget about it. the yields are too low and unattractive.\nreal…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qzpaxj/if_all_cash_seeking_return_ends_up_in_equities/","title":"If all cash seeking return ends up in equities because there are no alternatives worth the risk, what happens to bonds if the fed raises interest rates?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 23, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":null}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-r0e4ie","previousId":"RedditPost-r0d01y","nextId":"RedditPost-qzpaxj","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r0e4ie/this_paper_has_been_going_around_investing/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
