For this reason I’m staying clear of as many Chinese, &amp; heavily Chinese affiliated, stocks as reasonably possible in the US market.  I argue that China’s historic and repeated violation of Taiwanese airspace is likely to take the worlds attention away from the underlying economic conditions on the mainland, which if true, certainly indicates things are worse than China is making them out to be.</li>\n<li><strong>Why the Uncertainty:</strong> In addition to China being <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/goldman-sachs-cuts-chinas-gdp-growth-forecasts-amid-energy-crunch.html\">downgraded</a> by the ratings firms, China <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/china-issues-draft-rules-banning-unfair-competition-internet-sector-2021-08-17/\">regulating the hell</a> out of their publicly traded corporations, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-evergrande-debt/china-property-sector-woes-deepen-as-markets-await-evergrande-deal-idUSL4N2R10QL\">Chinese construction</a> going <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/evergrande-china-real-estate-debt-debacle-empty-buildings-cities-beijing-11633374710\">down the tubes</a> (<em>Its</em> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/china-property-default-risk-for-fantasia-sinic-amid-evergrande-crisis.html\"><em>spreading beyond Evergrande folks</em></a>), &amp; China’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/30/chinas-factory-activity-in-shock-slowdown-as-energy-crisis-hits-home\">energy crisis</a>, China has also been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58794094\">violating Taiwan’s airspace</a> at a record rate.</li>\n<li><strong>Indicators of Mainland Desperation:</strong> The Chinese are likely messing with Taiwan for four reasons I can think of.\n\n<ul>\n<li>1) To distract the world from their economic crises at home</li>\n<li>2) To test the international reaction both militarily &amp; diplomatically for strategic purposes</li>\n<li>3) To aid in training (war gaming) an eventual takeover of Taiwan (No secret folks, if they could snap their fingers and own Taiwan they would)</li>\n<li>4) To generate some leverage for future US talks and negotiations</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>The Distraction Game:</strong> The Chinese modus operandi when they have serious turmoil at home is to play the distraction game. The grander the distraction the larger their issues at home. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-touts-defense-as-china-pressures-island-with-frequent-flights-2021-10\">Taiwan presents a plausible distraction</a>, and its a big one!</li>\n<li><strong>In Chinese Media:</strong> Reviewing the various Chinese government media outlets (all media out of China is government media), I see a lot of stories about Taiwan, trade with the US, and friction with the US, but very little about their energy crisis and the seemingly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrandes-snowballing-debt-crisis-2021-09-14/\">company by company domino like collapse of their construction sector</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Why Empty Cities:</strong> Remember that China did not build <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/chinese-ghost-cities\">empty cities no one wanted to live in</a> because of market demand, but rather to artificially prop up their economy. Else they wouldn’t be empty. Economically speaking China did the equivalent of paying people to dig ditches, and then fill them back in again. Only they added the extra step of promising the digging company that people would pay them to rent the ditch.</li>\n<li><strong>What May Happen:</strong> If Chinese construction fails, then the banks are next. And if the banks fail, so too does the Chinese economy. However the Chinese economy is a command economy and enjoys the benefit of not really caring about the welfare of her people (The state supersedes the peoples welfare in China) so they will have more options available to them than we would in the US. Indeed printing and devaluating their currency is among them. But that will still have a horrible outcome for the Chinese people and international trade relations.</li>\n<li><strong>I&#39;m Out of Chinese Stocks:</strong> So I’m staying away from Chinese &amp; Chinese affiliated/dependent stocks which means no $DIS no $NKE no $AAPL no $TSLA no $WMT. Certainly no $NIO</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> You better bet your ass financial institutions and hedge funds are paying close attention to the economic state of China, and we had better too lest they pull the rug out from underneath us leaving retail traders, like us, with the bag.</p>\n\n<p>I am not long nor short any Chinese stock, nor short heavily Chinese affiliated US companies. In fact I am not short any stock right now.</p>\n\n<p>More Reading:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/china-property-default-risk-for-fantasia-sinic-amid-evergrande-crisis.html\">Chinese developer</a> misses bond payment as stress spreads beyond Evergrande crisis (<em>Domino Effect</em>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/evergrande-china-real-estate-debt-debacle-empty-buildings-cities-beijing-11633374710\">Empty Buildings</a> in China’s Provincial Cities Testify to Evergrande Debacle</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.designbuild-network.com/comment/economic-china-construction-output/\">Economic headwinds</a> expected to weigh on China’s construction output this year</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/business/china-businesses.html\">The End of a ‘Gilded Age</a>’: China Is Bringing Business to Heel</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-says-he-chinas-xi-have-agreed-abide-by-taiwan-agreement-2021-10-05/\">Biden says</a> he and China&#39;s Xi agree to abide by Taiwan agreement</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/empty-buildings-in-chinas-provincial-cities-testify-to-evergrande-debacle\">Empty buildings</a> in China’s provincial cities testify to Evergrande debacle</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/05/tensions-us-china-taiwan-515142\">Mounting tensions</a> between U.S., China raise new fears of threat to Taiwan</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q2anpm/why_im_staying_away_from_chinese_stocks_taiwan_is/","title":"Why I'm Staying Away From Chinese Stocks: Taiwan is an Indicator of Chinese Economic Problems","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-06T05:20:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-06 05:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q2anpm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q2anpm/why_im_staying_away_from_chinese_stocks_taiwan_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q2anpm/why_im_staying_away_from_chinese_stocks_taiwan_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"StockTipsTips","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/StockTipsTips","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"StockTipsTips","score":91,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"なぜ私は中国株から離れているのか。台湾は中国経済問題の指標である","the_new_excerpt":"観測結果\n\n * Stay Away From Chinese Stocks: 私は、東南アジアの市場が将来的に深刻な混乱に陥ると考えています。\n   中国株には手を出さないこと：私は、東南アジアでの市場の混乱を予想しています。この理由から、私は中国や中国系の銘柄をできるだけ避けています。\n   このため、私は中国株や中国に大きく関係する株をできるだけ避けている。\n   避けています。私は、中国の歴史的な...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么我远离中国股票？台湾是中国经济问题的一个指标","the_new_excerpt":"观察报告。\n\n * 远离中国股票。我正在评估一些严重的未来市场\n   我正在评估一些来自东南亚的严重市场动荡。出于这个原因，我正在远离尽可能多的中国股票。\n   尽可能多的中国股票，以及与中国有密切关系的股票，在合理的情况下。\n   美国市场。我认为，中国的历史悠久，在美国市场上，中国是一个非常重要的市场。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼我遠離中國股票？臺灣是中國經濟問題的一個指標","the_new_excerpt":"觀察報告。\n\n * 遠離中國股票。我正在評估一些嚴重的未來市場\n   我正在評估一些來自東南亞的嚴重市場動盪。出於這個原因，我正在遠離儘可能多的中國股票。\n   儘可能多的中國股票，以及與中國有密切關係的股票，在合理的情況下。\n   美國市場。我認爲，中國的歷史悠久，在美國市場上，中國是一個非常重要的市場。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q28kk2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q28kk2/fb/","title":"$FB","date":"October 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$FB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"$FB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"$FB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q1vr8q","excerpt":"Asking for friends who are 87 years old.
