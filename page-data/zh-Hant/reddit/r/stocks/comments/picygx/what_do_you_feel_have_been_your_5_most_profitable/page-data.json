Happy Sunday and I hope you all are enjoying this longer weekend. I think this is a very important topic because it will put the minds of every trader together to come out with 5 tickers or at least 3 that have been winners for you this year. This way people that have been negative now, or all year can have an idea of what they can do, or need to do in order to turn the ship around.</p>\n\n<p>We all have different strategies. I for one am a day trader so my 5 will be extremely different from a long term holder or swing trader. Do to the fact that I am a day trader. I will also list 5 stocks that I unfortunately allowed to go parabolic on me, but indeed I did trade them when they were far cheaper. For myself, I have something called “Plays” this is a special watch list of tickers that I am ready to trade now, that I feel safe, and I select my symbols off of this list. This list is well over 100 tickers. When a stock has gone up far to much, I no longer feel safe about it and do not trade it at all!</p>\n\n<p>Please try and be honest with ourselves and do not just try and pick the best gainers because this practice is for everyone to watch a new symbol or have an idea of how you played it to be a success. Thank you, share thoughts and please help one another:</p>\n\n<p>My 5 as a Day Trader:</p>\n\n<p>RKT – This stock is about 17 dollars, however I have traded this symbol so much that I have probably about 30 dollars in profits. I have traded this all year and even last year as well for 25 cents to a dollar</p>\n\n<p>UWMC – This is in the same sector as RKT, it stands at just 7.50 but I have traded this for probably close to 20 dollars, for many months I traded this 15-50 cents</p>\n\n<p>TIGR – This is about 13 dollars, I have traded this all year this year and also last year as well, I have probably 30+ dollars in profits on this one (25-75 cents a trade)</p>\n\n<p>CPNG – I know this stock is near a 52 week low (I actually have shares at 30.25) but I have traded in and out of this since IPO and have garnered about 50 in profits! (30 cents to 1.25)</p>\n\n<p>CRSR – I have traded this all year as well, no current position. I traded this as high as 40 and have easily made about 40 on this. (25 cents to 1.50)</p>\n\n<p>These are 5 that I owned and traded often but they just took off and I could not find myself trading them anymore</p>\n\n<p>BILL – This has gone insane, I traded this until about 100… I am actually very negative at these prices, yes, I missed out, but I made a lot on it</p>\n\n<p>MRNA – I know, I know, but when I was trading this, It was still a bio pharma with no vaccine yet! I actually traded this as low as 30 and stopped at 100…</p>\n\n<p>SE – I absolutely loved this company and traded it as low as 30-40 all the way to 150 and said to myself this is crazy! Look at it now, jesus</p>\n\n<p>CMG – OK, I did not trade this within 52 weeks but last March this dipped to 500! I was trading it all the way thru 750. Small blocks of 250 shares… What the heck are they selling EVs in the back? Mining in the basement????</p>\n\n<p>ZM- Boy when covid first hit I was destroying it on this from mid 60s all the way until 150!</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps others get an idea and thank you everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/picygx/what_do_you_feel_have_been_your_5_most_profitable/","title":"What do you feel have been your 5 most profitable tickers this year?
