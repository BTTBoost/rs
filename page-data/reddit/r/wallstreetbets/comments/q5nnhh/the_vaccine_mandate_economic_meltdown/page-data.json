If you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, Southwest cancelled 1,800 flights over the weekend leaving their customers in chaos.</p>\n\n<p>The company narrative is that this was due to weather and air traffic control issues. However, some quick googling revealed <a href=\"https://onemileatatime.com/news/southwest-airlines-operational-meltdown/\">this little gem</a> of an article. In summary, on Friday the pilot&#39;s union asked a court to block Southwest from enforcing the vaccine mandate and an unusual number of pilots called in sick over the weekend. Coincidence? Looks mighty suspicious to me.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also recently been a story of <a href=\"https://ktla.com/news/local-news/hundreds-of-l-a-city-firefighters-file-notice-of-intent-to-sue-over-covid-vaccine-mandate/\">hundreds of LA firefighters threatening to sue over the mandate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/09/26/1040780961/new-york-health-care-worker-vaccine-mandate-staffing-shortages-national-guard\">New York expecting to have to call in the National Guard over nursing shortages</a>. Without giving away too much personal information, I also happen to work for a large employer that would fall under the federal mandate. I can personally attest that there are enough employees refusing to take the vaccine that it will result in the shutting down of some critical operations.</p>\n\n<p>The market is already looking weak going into winter, and maybe economic disruption from vaccine protests will be what pushes it over the edge.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: From <a href=\"/u/LocalYokal\">/u/LocalYokal</a>: <a href=\"https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/urgent-a-southwest-airlines-pilot/comments\">https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/urgent-a-southwest-airlines-pilot/comments</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5nnhh/the_vaccine_mandate_economic_meltdown/","title":"The Vaccine Mandate Economic Meltdown?","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"October 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-11T13:48:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-11 13:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q5nnhh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5nnhh/the_vaccine_mandate_economic_meltdown/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5nnhh/the_vaccine_mandate_economic_meltdown/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"GreenDildoSurprise","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GreenDildoSurprise","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GreenDildoSurprise","score":1954,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"The Vaccine Mandate Economic Meltdown?","the_new_excerpt":"そのため、私は日曜日の夜遅くまで、サウスウエスト航空の問題にまったく気がつきませんでした。\n日曜の夜。何が起こっているのか知らない人のために説明すると、Southwestは週末に1,800便をキャンセルし、顧客を混乱に陥れました。\nのフライトがキャンセルされ、顧客は大混乱に陥りました。\n\n会社の説明によれば、これは天候と航空管制の問題によるものだそうです。\n問題....","locale":"ja"},{"title":"疫苗任务的经济崩溃？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我完全不知道西南航空公司的问题，直到周日晚间\n周日晚上。如果你不知道发生了什么事，西南航空在周末取消了1800个\n周末，西南航空取消了1800个航班，使他们的客户处于混乱之中。\n\n公司的说法是，这是由于天气和空中交通管制的原因。\n问题....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"疫苗任務的經濟崩潰？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我完全不知道西南航空公司的問題，直到週日晚間\n週日晚上。如果你不知道發生了什麼事，西南航空在週末取消了1800個\n週末，西南航空取消了1800個航班，使他們的客戶處於混亂之中。\n\n公司的說法是，這是由於天氣和空中交通管制的原因。\n問題....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q5t7ff","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5t7ff/good_morning_fellow_bulls_wake_up/","title":"Good morning fellow bulls, wake up 🌈🐻","date":"October 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"おはようございます！ブル仲間、起きてください🌈🐻。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"早上好，公牛伙伴们，醒醒吧！🌈🐻","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"早上好，公牛夥伴們，醒醒吧！🌈🐻","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q5pmfu","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/q5pmfu/jack_bogle_on_asset_allocation_and_market_collapse/","title":"Jack Bogle on Asset Allocation and Market Collapse","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 11, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ジャック・ボーグル、アセット・アロケーションと市場崩壊について","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"杰克-博格尔谈资产配置和市场崩溃","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"傑克-博格爾談資產配置和市場崩潰","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q5nnhh","previousId":"RedditPost-q5t7ff","nextId":"RedditPost-q5pmfu","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5nnhh/the_vaccine_mandate_economic_meltdown/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
