Big Oil&#39;s market cap is somewhere around $4T dollars.

And they are Expecting Netherlands to defeat an Imperial Japan in WW2.</p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you what happened to the Netherlands in the Pacific in WW2. Another time.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, Big Oil has massive power, massive. Political power, financial power, huge treasuries, cash flows. Collectively the Big Oil industry has more money to <strong>piss away on research</strong> than the entire value of the Renewable Sector.</p>\n\n<p>Right now an Oil company spends a $1.00 to get oil, and make $1.20 on that oil.</p>\n\n<p>Right now a Renewable company spends a $1.00 on their respective renewable, and makes about $1.15 on that productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Renewables can&#39;t invade the territory of Big Oil, but <strong>WHEN THE PRICE IS RIGHT</strong> Big oil can, <strong>AND WILL</strong> invade the Renewables&#39; territory.</p>\n\n<p>See where I&#39;m going with this?</p>\n\n<p>Big Oil will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wait until oil vs. renewable margins are closer.</li>\n<li>Invest in renewables.</li>\n<li>Use their political power to shut out anyone else</li>\n<li>Use their massive treasuries to shut out anyone else</li>\n<li>Use their propaganda machines and sheer weight to reduce the value of renewables and buy and absorb those companies into them when the price is right.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I therefore think the actual renewable play is Big Oil.</p>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s Big Oil is the future&#39;s Big Green.</p>\n\n<p>The Green Energy stocks of today are simply going to be gobbled up or shut down by the weight of oil companies when the profit margin of oil becomes closer to the profit margin of renewables.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And every major oil company already has a strategy to accomplish this.</strong></p>\n\n<p>XOM - Carbon Capture technology</p>\n\n<p>CVX - Green energy grid level storage technology.</p>\n\n<p>BP - Green energy/offshore wind - storage and carbon capture. Basically the full monte.</p>\n\n<p>To name a few.</p>\n\n<p>Oil companies are also investing in alternatives to electric vehicles. <strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Because when EVs become popular, they will face massive headwind from energy grids and power production prices rising in response to new demand.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Therefore when the EVs hit their first resistance to growth, Oil plans to enter with alternative combustion motors such as Hydrogen.</p>\n\n<p>So in conclusion I think the future of Green Energy are the biggest Oil Companies today.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/olo6xm/the_strategies_for_investing_in_green_energy_and/","title":"The Strategies for Investing in Green Energy and Renewables.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-17T02:05:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-17 02:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"29e18a1f-26a7-5d67-9128-1ad6457b7354","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/olo6xm/the_strategies_for_investing_in_green_energy_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/olo6xm/the_strategies_for_investing_in_green_energy_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"DarthTrader357","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DarthTrader357","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DarthTrader357","score":75,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"グリーンエネルギーと再生可能エネルギーへの投資の戦略。","the_new_excerpt":"ほとんどの投資家は、環境に優しい未来への投資方法について間違った考え方をしていると思います。\n環境に優しい未来に投資する方法について、多くの投資家は間違った考え方をしていると思います。\n\nソーラー企業はビッグ・オイルの存在に挑戦している、それがパラダイムだ\nこれは人々が不正確に理解しているパラダイムです。\n\nビッグ・オイルはどこにも行きません。ビッグ・オイルの時価総額は約4兆円。\nドルです。(Exxonは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"投资绿色能源和可再生能源的战略。","the_new_excerpt":"我相信，大多数投资者对如何投资于一个更绿色的未来有一个错误的心态。\n更加绿色的未来。\n\n太阳能公司正在挑战大石油公司的存在；这就是人们不准确理解的范式。\n人们不准确地理解。\n\n大石油公司并没有消失。大石油公司的市值约为4亿美元。\n美元。(埃克森公司是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資綠色能源和可再生能源的戰略。","the_new_excerpt":"我相信，大多數投資者對如何投資於一個更綠色的未來有一個錯誤的心態。\n更加綠色的未來。\n\n太陽能公司正在挑戰大石油公司的存在；這就是人們不準確理解的範式。\n人們不準確地理解。\n\n大石油公司並沒有消失。大石油公司的市值約爲4億美元。\n美元。(埃克森公司是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2c9048e8-eb78-5ec3-be4a-414b00f3aca8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olq2zu/100000_loss_on_gme_options/","title":"-$100,000 Loss on GME Options","date":"July 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"-$100,000 GMEオプションの損失","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"-100,000美元的GME期权损失","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"-100,000美元的GME期權損失","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-d3ad5f4c-2681-5adb-a839-0e101c8ca4d6","excerpt":"In a recent interview Jack Dorsey said that despite the ambitions of Square and\nTwitter, his real passion is building on Bitcoin.
