I know that most people are probably just saying it because they don&#39;t want anyone to lose money, and it&#39;s true that most people will be better off just by investing in the S&amp;P 500. If my mother wanted to invest, I&#39;d probably tell her the same thing, so I get it. But not anyone is like that, and I&#39;d like to see more encouragement in trying stuff, instead of just saying &quot;just put your money in the S&amp;P 500 and don&#39;t even try&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m fairly new to investing, but I get great joy from investing and researching companies. Investing in the S&amp;P 500 would be very boring for me. And I&#39;m also doing very well so far. I don&#39;t have a long track record at the moment obviously, since I&#39;ve been investing for only 2 years. So far, I&#39;ve always beat the S&amp;P 500 by a long margin . I know 2 years is not much, but hopefully I can continue doing great in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to be clear about the fact that I don&#39;t do day trading or any of this stuff. I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t be able to beat the S&amp;P 500 if I did that.</p>\n\n<p>My tactic is very simple: I buy great stocks and I hold. I never panic sell. And when things go badly and maybe some stocks go down 20%, that&#39;s when I buy more, because I still believe in my companies. I&#39;ve managed to cut out all of the emotions and it served me very well so far.</p>\n\n<p>I know that many people don&#39;t beat the S&amp;P 500 in the long run, but it&#39;s also true that the statistic is also full of people that do day trading or that simply panic sell every 6 months, right?</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m also curious to hear from people that have invested far longer than me; how&#39;s it going for you?</p>\n\n<p>Also, one more thing: funnily enough, 99% of the people that say to simply invest in the S&amp;P 500, are not even doing it themselves, and they&#39;re actually buying lots of individual stocks... and making lots of money. Isn&#39;t that ironic?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ldzbms/arent_you_tired_of_people_saying_just_invest_in/","title":"Aren't you tired of people saying \"just invest in the S&P 500\"?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T19:37:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 19:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2147b10e-fe10-5d3b-8487-d4f9debbf4a1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldzbms/arent_you_tired_of_people_saying_just_invest_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldzbms/arent_you_tired_of_people_saying_just_invest_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Kayters","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kayters","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Kayters","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你不厌烦别人说 \"投资标普500就好 \"吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我经常听到有人说：\"只要投资标普500指数就可以了，忘记了。\n反正你永远也打不过它\"（特别是在R/investing中\n[/r/investing]），有时候我觉得挺悲哀的。我知道，大多数人都是\n可能只是说，因为他们不希望任何人失去... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你不厭煩別人說 \"投資標普500就好 \"嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我經常聽到有人說：\"只要投資標普500指數就可以了，忘記了。\n反正你永遠也打不過它\"（特別是在R/investing中\n[/r/investing]），有時候我覺得挺悲哀的。我知道，大多數人都是\n可能只是說，因爲他們不希望任何人失去... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-478e77ac-6b49-5434-a8e7-b877fd47503d","excerpt":"All my charting shows we are at the top of ALL trend lines.
