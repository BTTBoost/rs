Suddenly Cathie Wood of ARK is adding it to her ARKK and ARKG funds</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile they make no money and have no real “product”. So is this a big bubble? What’s going on?</p>\n\n<p>My belief is that BEAM has the longest runway for the development of new therapeutics based on CRISPR technology because they have the BEST technology.</p>\n\n<p>The CRISPR technology that EDIT, CRSP, and NTLA use is essentially first generation CRISPR which cannot be targeted everywhere in the genome and has off-target effects.</p>\n\n<p>BEAM is the brainchild of David Liu, a Harvard scientist who utilizes forward evolution to engineer next-generation CRISPR. BEAM is specifically licensed to use Dr. Liu’s CRISPR technology, specifically his “base editors” and “prime editors.” Making a long story short, BEAM has the technology to edit anywhere in the genome with less off-target effects than the tech of NTLA, EDIT, and CRSP. Also, as you may know, EDIT, NTLA, and CRSP have had longstanding patent battles over their technology. BEAM has no such issue.</p>\n\n<p>So what’s BEAM’s plan?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>They can correct the ACTUAL sickle cell mutation that is present in patients. CRSP and the others are using their technology to turn on fetal hemoglobin production to bypass the mutation.</p></li>\n<li><p>In a collaboration with Verve, they showed they could correct the PCSK9 mutation in primates and PERMANENTLY lower blood cholesterol for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></li>\n<li><p>They also show data correcting the actual patient mutations in several liver diseases.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>David Liu just had a paper in Nature showing they could correct the mutation that causes progeria, which is the disease where you rapidly age. </li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is the stock a bubble that may collapse? I hope so. I’ll buy the dip.</p>\n\n<p>David Liu also has an agriculture company called Pairwise Plants in which they want to use the technology to gene edit crops, etc. If it goes public, I’ll be all over it.</p>\n\n<p>I am LONG BEAM. This is a little primer for the stock. Happy to discuss more in-depth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/le09xr/why_you_should_put_beam_on_your_watchlist/","title":"Why you should put BEAM on your watchlist","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T23:30:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 23:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9cbb9cde-af1e-5037-866f-f27b8083c68f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/le09xr/why_you_should_put_beam_on_your_watchlist/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/le09xr/why_you_should_put_beam_on_your_watchlist/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Social_History","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Social_History","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Social_History","score":89,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么你应该把BEAM列入你的观察名单？","the_new_excerpt":"你们中的一些人可能已经注意到，在CRISPR基因中出现了一个新的玩家。\n编辑领域，Beam Therapeutics，去年上市，并已从火箭般地从\n~20美元/股到目前约120美元/股。突然间，ARK的Cathie Wood成了\n把它加到她的ARKK和ARKG基金中去。\n\n同时，他们没有赚到钱，而且...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼你應該把BEAM列入你的觀察名單？","the_new_excerpt":"你們中的一些人可能已經注意到，在CRISPR基因中出現了一個新的玩家。\n編輯領域，Beam Therapeutics，去年上市，並已從火箭般地從\n~20美元/股到目前約120美元/股。突然間，ARK的Cathie Wood成了\n把它加到她的ARKK和ARKG基金中去。\n\n同時，他們沒有賺到錢，而且...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cb4fa164-9d73-5445-9c8e-683f7dc2ad95","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le1cmd/300_investors_strong/","title":"300 INVESTORS STRONG!","date":"February 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"300名投资人强势来袭!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"300名投資人強勢來襲!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-937bc2ca-62c5-53be-8cf8-a02a826bc2c9","excerpt":"Today, more than ever, I have seen an insanely high volume of people posting\n$GME gains.\n\nThat is all fine and dandy, if people close their positions for a gain then a\nwin is a win.
