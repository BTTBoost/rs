I have been invested in these companies in and out for quite some time. There is a scheduled merger between these two companies were all Aphria (APHA) shares will become TLRY shares with a conversion rate of every APHA share converting into roughly 0.83 TLRY shares come end of 2nd quarter (believe that would be April 14th). What I have noticed is that TLRY has been trading higher than it maybe should be given this conversion ratio. Basically, this means that if this conversion ratio were to be implemented today, it would be beneficial to buy APHA as these shares are currently worth less than 83% of the value of TLRY shares.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing this post, APHA is trading around $19.82 whereas TLRY is trading around $28.55. If the 0.83 conversion were to take place now, every APHA share would be converted into 0.83 TLRY shares which would be worth ~$23.70. It seems to me that in spite of this merger next month, either APHA is trading lower than it should or TLRY is trading higher. These stocks follow similar trends too and have essentially been consistently trading around the same percentage with APHA always trading lower than 83% of TLRY.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, shouldn’t the market adjust so that APHA gets closer to 83% of TLRY either by APHA going up independently of TLRY or TLRY going down independently of APHA. Otherwise am I missing something such as will the merger anyway reduce the stock price. Or perhaps since the merger is more than a month away this adjustment just hasn’t happened yet?</p>\n\n<p>I would think that since this company is expected to be the largest marijuana company in North America upon merging that APHA would seem to be the better buy than TLRY.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m35bte/aphria_and_tilray/","title":"Aphria and Tilray","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T05:01:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 05:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7956931f-9dae-5d01-9d6b-9434b68aa22d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m35bte/aphria_and_tilray/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m35bte/aphria_and_tilray/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"thejman1208","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thejman1208","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"thejman1208","score":91,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Aphria和Tilray","the_new_excerpt":"目前，这些股票今天的涨幅约为12-16%，只是在当天。I\n已经在这些公司里里外外投资了一段时间。有一个\n这两家公司计划合并，所有Aphria (APHA)的股票将被出售。\n成为TLRY股份，每一个APHA的转换率... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Aphria和Tilray","the_new_excerpt":"目前，這些股票今天的漲幅約爲12-16%，只是在當天。I\n已經在這些公司裏裏外外投資了一段時間。有一個\n這兩家公司計劃合併，所有Aphria (APHA)的股票將被出售。\n成爲TLRY股份，每一個APHA的轉換率... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c8978440-bb1e-5349-8eda-9847a49fe21e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m30k1i/will_meade_on_gme/","title":"Will Meade on GME","date":"March 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Will Meade在GME上","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Will Meade在GME上","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2796a707-2202-54f1-9db8-b7df7d9425c4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m36r8m/had_to_do_it/","title":"Had to do it","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 12, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不得不这么做","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不得不這麼做","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-7956931f-9dae-5d01-9d6b-9434b68aa22d","previousId":"RedditPost-c8978440-bb1e-5349-8eda-9847a49fe21e","nextId":"RedditPost-2796a707-2202-54f1-9db8-b7df7d9425c4","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m35bte/aphria_and_tilray/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
