There is no employer match. I looked at the plan&#39;s offerings and saw it had Vanguard target index funds with a fee of only .13%. I was excited!</p>\n\n<p>So, my dad had a meeting with the rep to sign up and it turns out his 457 plan adds a fee of .45% and another fee of .65% on top of .13% charged by Vanguard. So the total cost to invest in this Vanguard index fund is 1.23%, whereas you can invest directly with Vanguard for only .13%.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, the rep actually allocated 90% of the portfolio to an actively managed T Rowe Price target date fund with a final fee of 1.51% because the rep said the T Rowe Price fund had a better performance history than Vanguard. The final 10% the rep allocated to an actively managed REIT with a final fee of 1.98%.</p>\n\n<p>I feel horrible for my dad. Is he getting screwed or what?</p>\n\n<p>Although the fees are so high it is my understanding it&#39;s still better for my dad to do this because  of tax advantages. Of course I explained to my dad he should be maxing out his self directed IRA first and then contribute to the 457 plan.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I forgot to mention the rep for the 457 plan said the average mutual fund cost in the U.S. is 1.5%. Is this actually true?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/r1hqmx/huge_457_fees_i_want_to_cry/","title":"Huge 457 fees, I want to cry","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-25T03:40:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-25 03:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r1hqmx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/r1hqmx/huge_457_fees_i_want_to_cry/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/r1hqmx/huge_457_fees_i_want_to_cry/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"Learn_Finance","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Learn_Finance","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Learn_Finance","score":28,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"莫大な457の料金、泣きたくなる","the_new_excerpt":"父は定年間近なので、雇用主の457プランを利用してターゲットデートファンドに投資するのが最善だと勧めました。\nターゲットデートファンドへの投資を勧めました。そこには\n雇用者によるマッチングはありません。プランの提供物を見てみると、バンガードのターゲット・インデックス・ファンドがありました。\nインデックスファンドがあり、手数料はわずか0.13%でした。私は興奮しました。\n\nそれで、私の父が...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"巨大的457费用，我想哭了","the_new_excerpt":"我父亲临近退休，所以我建议为了他的最佳利益，通过他的雇主457计划投资于目标日期基金。\n通过他雇主的457计划投资于目标日期基金。没有\n雇主匹配。我看了看该计划的产品，看到它有Vanguard目标\n指数基金，费用只有0.13%。我很兴奋!\n\n所以，我父亲有一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"巨大的457費用，我想哭了","the_new_excerpt":"我父親臨近退休，所以我建議爲了他的最佳利益，通過他的僱主457計劃投資於目標日期基金。\n通過他僱主的457計劃投資於目標日期基金。沒有\n僱主匹配。我看了看該計劃的產品，看到它有Vanguard目標\n指數基金，費用只有0.13%。我很興奮!\n\n所以，我父親有一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r1echt","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r1echt/the_truth_is_out/","title":"THE TRUTH IS OUT","date":"November 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ザ・トゥルース・イズ・アウト","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"真相大白","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"真相大白","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-r1jtzh","excerpt":"So I asked this question a few months ago and I got some very interesting\nresponses, a lot of AMD, Cloudfare, and things of that nature.
