We also like Ford’s new leadership team, which we expect to bring a renewed focus on launch and warranty execution.&quot;”</p>\n\n<p>What do you think about Ford is going to hit $20 this year, besides their debt and low performance in previous times?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l2pw8v/jpmorgan_upgrades_ford_f_to_overweight_with_a/","title":"JPMorgan Upgrades Ford (F) to Overweight with a target of $14","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T05:59:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 05:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b65556d3-7fed-5e53-9fb3-d2109474a847","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l2pw8v/jpmorgan_upgrades_ford_f_to_overweight_with_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l2pw8v/jpmorgan_upgrades_ford_f_to_overweight_with_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"cerateCRT","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cerateCRT","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cerateCRT","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"摩根大通上调福特(F)评级至超配，目标价14美元。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17850058\n\n\"摩根大通分析师Ryan Brinkman将福特汽车（纽约证券交易所代码：F）的评级从中性上调至。\n超配，目标价14.00美元（从11.00美元），注意到股价是\n尽管出现了一些重大变化，但交易量与历史价值大致一致。\n正。\n\n该...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"摩根大通上調福特(F)評級至超配，目標價14美元。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17850058\n\n\"摩根大通分析師Ryan Brinkman將福特汽車（紐約證券交易所代碼：F）的評級從中性上調至。\n超配，目標價14.00美元（從11.00美元），注意到股價是\n儘管出現了一些重大變化，但交易量與歷史價值大致一致。\n正。\n\n該...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-070670bf-cb72-51ae-bfa1-00c15db4f562","excerpt":"Already reached my price target well before I expected.
