BABA&#39;s anti-trust investigation was met with little resistance from BABA. Jack Ma and BABA pretty much admitted guilt and gladly paid whatever fine to get over it. It&#39;s as if US Justice Department sues FB for anti-trust and wants to split Instagram from FB and Zuck just says &quot;Okay! And here is 1 billion dollar for your trouble Mr Judge.&quot; Instead, any similar anti-trust case in US will be met with fierce resistance from big corporations and litigation will last for years or maybe decades.</p>\n\n<p>DIDI, with the rumor that Chinese government is going to give them unprecedented punishment, dropped 20% today.</p>\n\n<p>Overnight while all tards are sleeping tightly in the freedom country, Bloomberg reported that Chinese government is planning to turn education and online tutoring sector into <strong>nonprofit.</strong> It dropped the entire Chinese education sector by <strong>50% - 70%</strong>. RIP for EDU and TAL bagholders...</p>\n\n<p>Well,  the scary thing is the public opinion in China always aligns with what the government wants to do. If you have friends in China, look up their comments on WeChat or WeiBo, they are cheering for turning education sector into non-profit.</p>\n\n<p>The honeymoon with Chinese tech stocks are way over and the price Chinese stocks, even now for some, have priced in friendly, laissez faire regulation and CONTROL from the Chinese government.</p>\n\n<p>And we can look at the data &quot;In total, more than $650 billion of market value has been erased from  the 98 stocks that make up the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index since  the gauge hit a record high in February.&quot; - Bloomberg.</p>\n\n<p>Without the regulatory pressure, I believe Chinese stocks would have been at ATH just like SPY and other indexes.</p>\n\n<p>It might be the time to be greedy while the market is fearful. Chinese market is huge and with tons of growth potential for anything and everything. But maybe in the short-term until this muddy policy /  attitude shift is over, it&#39;s better to stay away from the Chinese stock to not have that gut wrenching feeling when one of your holding drops 50% overnight without any fundamental change to its business.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Added some data from Bloomberg</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq7ojt/stay_away_from_chinese_stock_for_peace_of_mind/","title":"Stay Away From Chinese Stock For Peace Of Mind","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-24T15:48:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-24 15:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ecc3aa1c-51ca-5ed5-98fe-3a406486a8e8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq7ojt/stay_away_from_chinese_stock_for_peace_of_mind/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq7ojt/stay_away_from_chinese_stock_for_peace_of_mind/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"margin_call_rep","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/margin_call_rep","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"margin_call_rep","score":1123,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"安心して中国株を買うために","the_new_excerpt":"中国株、特にハイテク株には、これまでにない政策・規制上の\nリスクを抱えています。BABA の反トラスト調査は、BABA からの抵抗はほとんどありませんでした。\nジャック・マーとBABAはほとんど罪を認め、どんな罰金でも喜んで払って乗り切りました。\nています。あたかも米司法省がFBを独占禁止法違反で訴えたように。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"远离中国股票以确保安全","the_new_excerpt":"中国的股票，特别是科技股现在有前所未有的政策/监管\n风险。BABA的反垄断调查几乎没有受到BABA的抵抗。\n马云和BABA几乎承认了自己的罪行，并欣然支付了任何罚款以摆脱困境。\n罚款来了结此事。这就像美国司法部起诉FB的反垄断一样。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"遠離中國股票以確保安全","the_new_excerpt":"中國的股票，特別是科技股現在有前所未有的政策/監管\n風險。BABA的反壟斷調查幾乎沒有受到BABA的抵抗。\n馬雲和BABA幾乎承認了自己的罪行，並欣然支付了任何罰款以擺脫困境。\n罰款來了結此事。這就像美國司法部起訴FB的反壟斷一樣。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ae19e492-3fe7-5325-9e7a-2a0a3e810e13","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq6061/clean_367_on_0_dte_spy_calls_for_244k_thank_you/","title":"Clean +367% on 0 DTE $SPY calls for $244k, thank you Daddy JPow 🙏 🚀🌒","date":"July 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"0枚のDTE $SPYコールで$244kのクリーンな+367%, Thank you Daddy JPow 🙏 🚀🌒","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"在0个DTE $SPY电话上干净的+367%，获得了24.4万美元，谢谢你，JPow爸爸🙏 🚀🌒","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在0個DTE $SPY電話上乾淨的+367%，獲得了24.4萬美元，謝謝你，JPow爸爸🙏 🚀🌒","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1418764001190858752","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1418764001190858752","title":"It’s a HIPAA violation to ask me about my stock picks this year","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 24, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"私の今年の銘柄について聞くのはHIPAA違反です","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"问我今年的股票选择是违反HIPAA的。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"問我今年的股票選擇是違反HIPAA的。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ecc3aa1c-51ca-5ed5-98fe-3a406486a8e8","previousId":"RedditPost-ae19e492-3fe7-5325-9e7a-2a0a3e810e13","nextId":"TweetPost-1418764001190858752","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq7ojt/stay_away_from_chinese_stock_for_peace_of_mind/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
