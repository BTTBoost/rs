I&#39;m sure a lot of you have seen me post most of this in the daily threads, but it would be nice to get this some real visibility ahead of Tuesday:</p>\n\n<p>Just a reminder that there hasn&#39;t been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and <strong>tomorrow</strong> is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.</p>\n\n<p>Last 2 big news catalysts?</p>\n\n<p><strong>3/8</strong> - <a href=\"https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update\">Gamestop governance update</a> announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.</p>\n\n<p>3 day action around that announcement:</p>\n\n<p>03/09/2021 Open: $217.71  Close: $246.90  Vol: 39,099,330</p>\n\n<p>03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: <strong>63,565,620</strong></p>\n\n<p>03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670</p>\n\n<p><strong>2/23</strong> - <a href=\"https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support\">Gamestop announces resignation of CFO</a> and succession plan. This was announced post-market.</p>\n\n<p><em>4</em> day action around that announcement (edited to include the 25th since the news dropped post-market on the 23rd):</p>\n\n<p>02/25/2021 Open: $169.56 Close: $108.73 Vol: <strong>150,308,800</strong></p>\n\n<p>02/24/2021 Open: $44.70  Close: $91.71  Vol: <strong>83,111,740</strong></p>\n\n<p>02/23/2021 Open: $44.97 Close: $44.97   Vol: 7,565,215</p>\n\n<p>02/22/2021 Open: $46.69 Close: $46.00   Vol: 19,476,020</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Action following these news catalysts:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical\">Link to NASDAQ&#39;s historical data for GME</a></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s how closing price trended around these two announcements:</p>\n\n<p>2/23 - Close: $44.97 -  <strong>CFO announcement after hours</strong></p>\n\n<p>2/24 - Close: $91.71</p>\n\n<p>2/25 - Close: $108.73</p>\n\n<p>2/26 - Close: $101.74</p>\n\n<p>3/01 - Close: $120.40</p>\n\n<p>3/02 - Close: $118.18</p>\n\n<p>3/03 - Close: $124.18</p>\n\n<p>3/04 - Close: $132.35</p>\n\n<p>3/05 - Close: $137.74</p>\n\n<p>3/08 - Close: $194.50 - <strong>Committee announcement pre-market</strong></p>\n\n<p>3/09 - Close: $246.90</p>\n\n<p>3/10 - Close: $265.00 - <strong>Day&#39;s high: $348.5 - flash crash attempt</strong></p>\n\n<p>3/11 - Close: $260.00</p>\n\n<p>3/12 - Close: $264.5</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, there are immediate and lasting price leaps from these catalysts. After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We&#39;ve consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That&#39;s a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we&#39;ve seen, possibly bigger than January&#39;s gamma squeeze that got cut short.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Next confirmed Gamestop announcement:</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>3/23</strong> <a href=\"https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings\">Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings</a></p>\n\n<p>Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the <em>possibility</em> that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.</p>\n\n<p><em>A note on earnings:</em> <strong>Gamestop&#39;s fiscal year runs through January</strong>. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.</p>\n\n<p>For those that want to dial in:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>2020 earnings results after the market closes on Tuesday, March 23, 2021.
