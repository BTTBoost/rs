The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) retreated from record levels, falling 0.59% and 0.63% respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.57% while the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its streak of outperformance to finish 1.06% down. Market participants are digesting a key Federal Reserve event and a speech by chairman Jerome Powell tomorrow. Market participants are looking for any new clues regarding a taper timeline that might emerge.</p>\n\n<p>The annual Jackson Hole Symposium is a conference that brings together members of the Federal Reserve, economists, policymakers, academics, and government officials in order to discuss issues and challenges relevant to monetary policy and the stock market. The Fed’s July meeting minutes stated about a potential taper timeline, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.” As the Jackson Hole meeting kicks off, market participants are anxiously waiting to see if any more information or details regarding the taper timeline are divulged.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, which is shared by many pundits, Powell will likely keep his messaging in line with his other recent public remarks, signaling the economy has progressed toward the central bank&#39;s goals while still remaining a ways off from fully reaching the thresholds necessary to begin tapering.</p>\n\n<p>Wells Fargo Senior Macro Strategist Zach Griffiths said, “We don’t think the Fed is going to do anything suddenly, and we really don’t think Chairman Powell is going to indicate that they’re ready to move policy anytime soon. If you look at the July FOMC statement, they did indicate that they have seen progress toward their goals, but if you listen to [Powell’s] press conference, he really walked that back and said they are still a ways off from the ‘substantial further progress’ threshold. So we expect Chairman Powell to remain resolutely dovish.”</p>\n\n<p>“All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.” - Walt Disney</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pc9dvd/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_thursday_august/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, August 26, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-26T23:37:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-26 23:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7070d7f1-f55a-56f0-b037-fa2ba9076711","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pc9dvd/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_thursday_august/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pc9dvd/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_thursday_august/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":131,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本日2021年8月26日（木）のMarket Recapをご紹介します。","the_new_excerpt":"サイコ・マーケット・リカップ - 2021年8月26日（木\n\n株式は下落し、主要3指数はすべて初日にマイナスとなった。\nボラティリティーの上昇にもかかわらず、注目すべき5日間の連勝を記録した後に\nFRBの7月分の議事録の発表を受けて。S&P 500（SPY）と\nナスダック(QQQ)は反落しました・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"以下是今天的市场回顾，2021年8月26日，星期四","the_new_excerpt":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年8月26日，星期四\n\n股市下跌，所有三个主要指数都录得首日下跌\n在美联储7月会议纪要公布后，尽管波动性增加，但在五天的显著连胜之后\n在美联储7月会议纪要发布后，所有三大股指均出现下跌。标准普尔500指数（SPY）和\n纳斯达克指数（QQQ）回落...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是今天的市場回顧，2021年8月26日，星期四","the_new_excerpt":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年8月26日，星期四\n\n股市下跌，所有三個主要指數都錄得首日下跌\n在美聯儲7月會議紀要公佈後，儘管波動性增加，但在五天的顯著連勝之後\n在美聯儲7月會議紀要發佈後，所有三大股指均出現下跌。標準普爾500指數（SPY）和\n納斯達克指數（QQQ）回落...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ece93cd9-c3c2-5c7d-909c-d286583ddb26","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pc54qh/it_is_time_to_return_to_the_one_true_meme_gme_yolo/","title":"🚀🚀🚀🚀It is time to return to the one true meme GME YOLO 🚀🚀🚀🚀","date":"August 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"🚀🚀🚀🚀唯一の真のミームであるGME YOLOに戻る時が来たのだ 🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"🚀🚀🚀🚀 是时候回到一个真正的备忘录 GME YOLO 🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"🚀🚀🚀🚀 是時候回到一個真正的備忘錄 GME YOLO 🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1430993456248274949","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1430993456248274949","title":"NEW FREEDOMS GRANTED IN AUSTRALIA!\n\nFULLY VAXXED Residents of hotspots can leave home for an hour of recreation on top of their exercise hour, while people in other areas can meet five others outdoors.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 27, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"オーストラリアに新たな自由が誕生!\n\nFULLY VAXXED ホットスポットの住人は、運動時間に加えて1時間のレクリエーションのために家を出ることができ、他の地域の人は屋外で5人と会うことができます。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"在澳大利亚获得新的自由!\n\n充分VAXXED 热点地区的居民可以在锻炼时间的基础上离开家，进行一小时的娱乐活动，而其他地区的人可以在户外与其他五人会面。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"在澳大利亞獲得新的自由!\n\n充分VAXXED 熱點地區的居民可以在鍛鍊時間的基礎上離開家，進行一小時的娛樂活動，而其他地區的人可以在戶外與其他五人會面。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-7070d7f1-f55a-56f0-b037-fa2ba9076711","previousId":"RedditPost-ece93cd9-c3c2-5c7d-909c-d286583ddb26","nextId":"TweetPost-1430993456248274949","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pc9dvd/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_thursday_august/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
