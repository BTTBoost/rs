First off here&#39;s YOLO Proof: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/rIYNnnp\">https://imgur.com/a/rIYNnnp</a> - the total gains reflected is not accurate as I rolled a lot of my July contracts to October for similar pricing.\nOnto the DD:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>GALILEO, the B2B Monster - This company you probably never heard of got acquired by Sofi last year. They are a payment processing platform that financial tech companies use to process payments, issue company branded debit cards. A similar company Marqeta $MQ which powers $SQ debit cards is valued at 15 Billion ALONE. Galileo is only one subdivision of the SOFI conglomerate, as of this writing $SOFI is valued 16.83 Billion. Over 90% of all digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 Fintech companies use Galileo, it speaks for itself. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/slEyUSe\">https://imgur.com/a/slEyUSe</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The shorts and Goliath - This stock has been shorted with an insane borrow fee of 222.82%. Shortable stocks shows &#39;Zero Borrow&#39;, but still lists 45000 shares available. Fintel shows on 06/24 there are &#39;0&#39; SOFI short shares available. I don&#39;t see why this stock is so shorted, but it is a company that went public via Chamath Palihapitiya via IPOE. Just like CLOV and SPCE before this. - forewarning, a lockup period expires for  lshareholders today. Trying to find exact number. I believe a lot of people sold in anticipation of insiders selling, but I&#39;m a firm believer in the company nonetheless.</p></li>\n<li><p>SOFI is applying to become a national bank to get their cost of money down, and they have attempted to speed that process up by acquiring a small bank and infusing cash into it:\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/SEeFYKm\">https://imgur.com/a/SEeFYKm</a>\nThe one stop shop -\nSOFI&#39;s goal is to become a one stop shop for consumers. Banking, lending, credit cards, trade stocks, provides insurance, everything. This is the one thing I have yet to see any FinTech attempt. Most FinTech&#39;s stick to a singular product but SOFI is seeking to service everyone&#39;s financial needs in one app. SOFI&#39;s revenue will only continue to grow as if a new member joins they&#39;ll likely use more than just the initial service they got on board with.</p></li>\n<li><p>SOFI Invest - I think this is probably the most important platform for them to be working. When Robinhood Robin hooded us back in February, everyone was looking for another platform to go onto. A lot of people went to Fidelity, a lot stayed, and a few went to SOFI, this is SOFI&#39;s short fall. They do not have margin yet and no options currently, but Anthony Noto, the CEO of SOFI announced that it&#39;s on their road map: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/apMyXXD\">https://imgur.com/a/apMyXXD</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I believe they&#39;re aware of of the importance of adding options and margin and I&#39;m hoping itll be soon as they&#39;re 100% getting my business after they do so. SOFI Hong Kong already has margin as well.\n-   SOFI Stadium, come on, what a chad company flexing a stadium even though they&#39;re new to the game.   </p>\n\n<p>At the end I like this company, they have great potential to become a dominating</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: These opinions are of my own, I own $Sofi options, and SOFI Shares. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. This is my opinion and as always do your own research! </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: A great financial tech company that has a lot of potential, earnings are around the corner August 11, 2021, BULLISH AF</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/","title":"Why $SOFI will be SOFLY - My $78,000 YOLO into $SOFI and why this company has great potential - The stock that costs short sellers 222.82% to borrow, and why I like the stock","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"June 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-28T23:28:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-28 23:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b8a4a93e-37bd-5ee9-9a67-e9ac939e8b80","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"havocs2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/havocs2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"havocs2","score":1667,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"なぜ$SOFIはSOFLYになるのか - 私が$SOFIに78,000ドルのYOLOをした理由と、この会社が大きな可能性を秘めている理由 - 空売りが借りるのに222.82%のコストがかかる銘柄と、私がこの銘柄を好きな理由","the_new_excerpt":"みんな、聞いてくれ！SOFIが上場すると聞いたとき、僕はたくさんのお金を注ぎ込んで、長い間アプリを使ってきた。\n大金を注ぎ込み、長い間このアプリを使いました。\n彼らはフィンテック分野を支配することになるだろう。まずはここでYOLOの証明を。\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rIYNnnp - 反映されている総利益は正確ではありませんので...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么$SOFI将成为SOFLY - 我的78,000美元YOLO进入$SOFI，以及为什么这家公司有巨大的潜力 - 做空者要花费222.82%的费用才能借到的股票，以及为什么我喜欢这支股票","the_new_excerpt":"听好了，伙计们，当我听说SOFI要上市的时候，我在里面投了很多钱。\n我给它投了很多钱，用了很长时间的应用程序，他们将\n他们将成为金融科技领域的主导。首先，这里有YOLO证明。\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rIYNnnp - 反映的总收益并不准确，因为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼$SOFI將成爲SOFLY - 我的78,000美元YOLO進入$SOFI，以及爲什麼這家公司有巨大的潛力 - 做空者要花費222.82%的費用才能借到的股票，以及爲什麼我喜歡這支股票","the_new_excerpt":"聽好了，夥計們，當我聽說SOFI要上市的時候，我在裏面投了很多錢。\n我給它投了很多錢，用了很長時間的應用程序，他們將\n他們將成爲金融科技領域的主導。首先，這裏有YOLO證明。\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rIYNnnp - 反映的總收益並不準確，因爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-46ed55f9-463b-58bd-87dd-9e8479fce953","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9mr0l/play_is_the_play_i_hope/","title":"$PLAY is the play?
