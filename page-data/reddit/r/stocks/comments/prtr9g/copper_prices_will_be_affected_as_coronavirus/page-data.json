It affected a lot of industries, and especially a great number of economic activities, which includes mining.</p>\n\n<p>But for Chile, which is the top copper-producing nation, it seemed like the country’s mining industry is not deterred at all. Copper production by mining companies in the country make up 28 percent of global output. The mineral accounts for 10-15 percent of the South American country&#39;s GDP, with much of it exported to China, the world&#39;s biggest consumer.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the copper production is expected to go down from 5.7 million tonnes to 5.4 million tonnes this year, the mining sector is still pushing through the crisis with minimal issues. Despite the health panic, mining is not affected much and companies are still continuously producing and going on with their activities.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it is not the pandemic, but labor tensions are actually the main factors why there was almost a problem with the copper supply coming from the country. Codelco had to face and end a strike with their plant workers, while BHP Group accepted had a new wage proposal for their union members. Right now Codelco and BHP managed to ease the labor tensions so there is no risks or issues when it comes to the copper supply. </p>\n\n<p>Junior companies are also showing promise with their mines located in the mineral-rich country and is also contributing to the production of the mineral in the nation. Marimaca Copper Corp. for example, released the results of their reverse circulation (“RC”) drilling completed at the Mercedes Target, which has intersected significant oxide copper mineralization from surface. </p>\n\n<p>Three Valley Copper, which has mines in Chile, just announced their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. Despite these being smaller players in the mining scene in the country, both are to show great potential and are still relevant contributors in copper production once they start producing.</p>\n\n<p>With the recent gain of copper as Shanghai stocks fell 10.7% and the eased tension between workers and mining companies, I believe that copper prices will definitely rally and get affected by all these circumstances. Concerns about the supply faded, global stimulus measures are keeping the demand for it stronger, and with the coronavirus restriction slowly getting lifted up, I think we can all expect more production from the top copper-producing country in the world.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/prtr9g/copper_prices_will_be_affected_as_coronavirus/","title":"Copper prices will be affected as coronavirus restrictions fade and the mining situation improve","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-20T14:59:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-20 14:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"prtr9g","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/prtr9g/copper_prices_will_be_affected_as_coronavirus/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/prtr9g/copper_prices_will_be_affected_as_coronavirus/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Alarmed_Ad6556","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarmed_Ad6556","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Alarmed_Ad6556","score":238,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"コロナウイルスの規制が弱まり、鉱山の状況が改善されると銅価格に影響が出る","the_new_excerpt":"パンデミックの発生は、多くの産業を混乱させ、企業や個人に大きな影響を与えました。\n企業や個人に大きな影響を与えました。多くの産業に影響を与え、特に\n特に、鉱業を含む多くの経済活動に影響を与えました。\n\nしかし、トップの銅生産国であるチリにとって、それはまるで...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"随着冠状病毒限制的消退和采矿情况的改善，铜价将受到影响","the_new_excerpt":"大流行病的爆发扰乱了许多行业，对公司和个人产生了很大的影响。\n公司和个人造成很大影响。它影响了很多行业，特别是大量的经济活动，包括采矿业。\n特别是大量的经济活动，其中包括采矿业。\n\n但是对于智利这个顶级的铜生产国来说，它似乎...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"隨着冠狀病毒限制的消退和採礦情況的改善，銅價將受到影響","the_new_excerpt":"大流行病的爆發擾亂了許多行業，對公司和個人產生了很大的影響。\n公司和個人造成很大影響。它影響了很多行業，特別是大量的經濟活動，包括採礦業。\n特別是大量的經濟活動，其中包括採礦業。\n\n但是對於智利這個頂級的銅生產國來說，它似乎...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1439931056778534915","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1439931056778534915","title":"\"Is this the next Lehman Brothers?
