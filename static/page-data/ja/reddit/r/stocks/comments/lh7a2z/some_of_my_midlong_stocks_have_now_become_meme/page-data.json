Especially once the media starts talking about X or Y company being the next big Reddit stock?  It makes regular investors grow leary of the stock afterwards, and the businesses are then lumped in with the /wsb stonks that were hyped.</p>\n\n<p>What should have been steady month-over-month climbs for some of these have now made me feel like I have to watch my holdings like a hawk for when everyone starts dumping so I don&#39;t just not only lose out on earnings, but end up with shares that are valued much less than what I paid for them.</p>\n\n<p>Is anyone else in the same boat?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: just to share what ones in my portfolio I&#39;m speaking about: MARA, NIO, PLUG, TLRY, APHA, SSPK, BB, HEXO.
