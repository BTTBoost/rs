New jobless claims paid traditionally by the states fell by 38,000 in the seven days ended Oct. 2 from 364,000 in the prior week, the government said Thursday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had estimated new claims would drop to a seasonally adjusted 345,000. </p>\n\n<p>Before the most recent decline, new applications for jobless benefits had risen three weeks in a row, raising questions about whether the delta variant had forced more businesses to lay off workers. Yet most of the increase took place in California and suggested the problems were not widespread. The rest of the states have largely seen applications for unemployment benefits flatten out or decline over the past month.</p>\n\n<p>The number of people already collecting state jobless benefits, meanwhile, dropped by 98,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.71 million. These so-called continuing claims are near a pandemic low. Altogether, some 4.17 million people were reportedly receiving jobless benefits through eight separate state or federal programs as of Sept. 18. That’s down sharply from 11.3 million at the start of the month, mostly because of the end of temporary federal program to help the unemployed.</p>\n\n<p>The critical U.S. employment report for September that comes out on Friday could shed light on whether more people are returning to the labor force. Wall Street economists predict job creation will more than doubled to around 500,000 from just 235,000 new jobs created in August.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-jobless-claims-sink-38-000-to-326-000-in-sign-of-improving-labor-market-11633610565?mod=mw_latestnews\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-jobless-claims-sink-38-000-to-326-000-in-sign-of-improving-labor-market-11633610565?mod=mw_latestnews</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q393tr/us_jobless_claims_sink_38000_to_326000_in_sign_of/","title":"U.S. jobless claims sink 38,000 to 326,000 in sign of improving labor market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-07T15:48:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-07 15:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q393tr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q393tr/us_jobless_claims_sink_38000_to_326000_in_sign_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q393tr/us_jobless_claims_sink_38000_to_326000_in_sign_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rugerapatt","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rugerapatt","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rugerapatt","score":1387,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"米国の失業保険申請件数は38,000件減の326,000件、労働市場の改善を示す","the_new_excerpt":"数字で見ると 最近仕事を失った32万6,000人の人々が、今年の前半に失業手当を申請しました。\n失業給付申請者数は326,000人となり、1ヵ月ぶりに減少に転じた。\n米国の労働市場のさらなる改善を示唆している。新規失業保険申請件数\n各州が伝統的に支払っている新規失業保険申請件数は、7日間で3万8千件減少しました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国申请失业救济金人数下降3.8万至32.6万，表明劳动力市场在改善。","the_new_excerpt":"这些数字。约有32.6万最近失去工作的人申请了\n10月初，约有32.6万人申请失业救济金，这是一个月以来的首次下降，表明美国劳动力市场进一步改善。\n指向美国劳动力市场的进一步改善。新的失业申请\n传统上由各州支付的新失业救济金在七天内减少了38,000。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國申請失業救濟金人數下降3.8萬至32.6萬，表明勞動力市場在改善。","the_new_excerpt":"這些數字。約有32.6萬最近失去工作的人申請了\n10月初，約有32.6萬人申請失業救濟金，這是一個月以來的首次下降，表明美國勞動力市場進一步改善。\n指向美國勞動力市場的進一步改善。新的失業申請\n傳統上由各州支付的新失業救濟金在七天內減少了38,000。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q37skg","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q37skg/cnbc_has_this_guys_on_front_page_which_means/","title":"CNBC has this guy’s on front page which means market is going to be green today but your calls people!","date":"October 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CNBCはこの男を一面に掲載しており、これは今日の市場がグリーンになることを意味していますが、皆さんの電話番号を教えてください。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"CNBC在头版刊登了这个人的文章，这意味着今天的市场将是绿色的，但你的电话也是如此。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"CNBC在頭版刊登了這個人的文章，這意味着今天的市場將是綠色的，但你的電話也是如此。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q38tcb","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html\n\n> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 303 points, or 0.9%.
