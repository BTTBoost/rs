Don&#39;t miss the forest for the trees. Journalists need to write something new every day (or every hour it seems), even if there isn&#39;t anything new to say. Which leads to a lot of noise that clouds your mind from making sense of what is really happening in the world.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, the problem is clear: governments overdid it with stimulus. Unlike the 2008 Global Financial Crisis where policymakers did too little and acted too slow, this time around governments decided to err on the side of doing too much too quickly. If you look at consumer spending on FRED, it didn&#39;t just fully recovery from the 2020 shock, it&#39;s arguably on a stronger trajectory than it otherwise would be without the pandemic! At the same time, unemployment is still high and labor force participation is dreadfully low! The Fed created such a tremendous wealth effect, people are earning multiple years worth of stock market returns in the span of months. I&#39;m not surprised many people are taking career breaks or retiring early. So why do we have red hot inflation? Because we&#39;re printing more money and making less things, it&#39;s that simple.</p>\n\n<p>The inflation problem highlights how difficult it is to be a policymaker. On one hand, you don&#39;t want to under spend and risk seeing long-term economic scarring, but if you stimulate too much, you risk fueling inflation as well as asset price bubbles. The other factor at play is the politicization of economic policy. You&#39;re everyone&#39;s favorite politician when you&#39;re fueling spending, but it&#39;s hard to get reelected when you advocate for cutbacks. Prudent policymaking requires spending when times are bad, and building reserves when times are good - politicians have forgot about the latter half of that equation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qsdxg3/sky_high_inflation_isnt_due_to_supply_chain/","title":"Sky high inflation isn't due to \"supply chain bottlenecks\", it's due to printing too much money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-12T17:04:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-12 17:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qsdxg3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qsdxg3/sky_high_inflation_isnt_due_to_supply_chain/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qsdxg3/sky_high_inflation_isnt_due_to_supply_chain/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"CanadianStrategist","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CanadianStrategist","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"CanadianStrategist","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"空前のインフレは「サプライチェーンのボトルネック」ではなく、「お金の刷りすぎ」が原因だ","the_new_excerpt":"最近、サプライチェーンに関する記事や投稿をよく目にします。\nコンテナを買うのにお金がかかるとか、港に十分なスペースがないとか......。\n港に十分なスペースがないとか、トラック運転手の数が足りないとか。\nトラック運転手が足りない、などなど。\n\nしかし、これらはすべて、ミクロレベルの症状であり...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"天价通胀不是因为 \"供应链瓶颈\"，而是因为印了太多的钱","the_new_excerpt":"我看到这些天有很多文章和帖子都在谈论供应链问题。\n不管是关于购买一个集装箱有多贵，还是说\n或航运港口没有足够的空间，或没有足够的\n卡车司机，等等。\n\n然而，这些都是微观层面的症状。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"天價通脹不是因爲 \"供應鏈瓶頸\"，而是因爲印了太多的錢","the_new_excerpt":"我看到這些天有很多文章和帖子都在談論供應鏈問題。\n不管是關於購買一個集裝箱有多貴，還是說\n或航運港口沒有足夠的空間，或沒有足夠的\n卡車司機，等等。\n\n然而，這些都是微觀層面的症狀。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qs4tiv","excerpt":"Paypal at PE of 48.6\n\nMastercard at 43.6\n\nVisa at 37.4\n\nWhile Paypal is the most expensive purely from PE point of view, I'm leaning\nmore towards them because they've historically had higher revenue growth\ncompared to the other two and they're diversified or are trying to diversity\ninto things like…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qs4tiv/at_current_prices_which_would_you_choose_between/","title":"At current prices, which would you choose between V, MA, and PYPL?","date":"November 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"現在の価格では、V、MA、PYPLのうちどれを選ぶか？","the_new_excerpt":"PaypalのPEは48.6\n\nMastercardは43.6\n\nビザ：37.4\n\n純粋にPEの観点から見ると、Paypalが最も高いのですが、私はPaypalに傾いています。\n他の2社に比べて、歴史的に高い収益成長率を達成していることから、私はPaypalに傾いています。\n他の2社と比較して、歴史的に高い収益成長率を誇っていること、また、以下のような分野に多様化している、あるいは多様化しようとしていることから、私はPayPalに傾いています。\nのようなものに多様化している、あるいは多様化しようとしているからです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在目前的价格下，你会在V、MA和PYPL之间选择哪个？","the_new_excerpt":"支付宝的PE为48.6\n\n万事达卡为43.6\n\nVisa为37.4\n\n虽然单纯从PE的角度来看，Paypal是最昂贵的，但我更倾向于他们，因为他们在过去的历史中一直是最受欢迎的。\n我更倾向于他们，因为他们在历史上有更高的收入增长。\n与其他两家相比，他们有更高的收入增长，而且他们是多元化的，或正试图多元化的\n到诸如...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在目前的價格下，你會在V、MA和PYPL之間選擇哪個？","the_new_excerpt":"支付寶的PE爲48.6\n\n萬事達卡爲43.6\n\nVisa爲37.4\n\n雖然單純從PE的角度來看，Paypal是最昂貴的，但我更傾向於他們，因爲他們在過去的歷史中一直是最受歡迎的。\n我更傾向於他們，因爲他們在歷史上有更高的收入增長。\n與其他兩家相比，他們有更高的收入增長，而且他們是多元化的，或正試圖多元化的\n到諸如...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qs96pb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qs96pb/autism_bets/","title":"Autism Bets","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 12, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Autism Bets","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"自闭症的赌注","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"自閉症的賭注","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qsdxg3","previousId":"RedditPost-qs4tiv","nextId":"RedditPost-qs96pb","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qsdxg3/sky_high_inflation_isnt_due_to_supply_chain/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
