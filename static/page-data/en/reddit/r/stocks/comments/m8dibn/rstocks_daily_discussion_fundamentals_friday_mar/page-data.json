Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.</p>\n\n<p>See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post\">Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings</a></p>\n\n<p>If you have a basic question, for example &quot;what is EBITDA,&quot;
