As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.</p>\n\n<p>“As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,” Biden said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>The nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>In making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its “decisive” action in the early days of the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank’s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.</p>\n\n<p>“Chair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,” a White House statement said. “During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic recovery.”</p>\n\n<p>Though Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated – in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.</p>\n\n<p>Powell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.</p>\n\n<p>The inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.</p>\n\n<p>The White House statement said the recovery is “a testament to the success of the President’s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s economy back on track.”</p>\n\n<p>Brainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.</p>\n\n<p>A former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.</p>\n\n<p>The White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.</p>\n\n<p>Biden said that Powell and Brainard “also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.”</p>\n\n<p>“Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>Political pressure, and a Covid struggle\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Though Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers “boneheads” for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.</p>\n\n<p>As for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation’s banking system.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation’s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>To combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Economists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. </p>\n\n<p>“Under Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,” Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.</p>\n\n<p>“This is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden’s agenda.”  </p>\n\n<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden’s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief’s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed’s chair and is the country’s first female Treasury secretary. </p>\n\n<p>“I talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,” Yellen said. “I think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.” </p>\n\n<p>Powell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. </p>\n\n<p>The news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed’s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a “dangerous man” and that she would oppose his renomination.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qzm7ni/biden_picks_jerome_powell_to_lead_the_fed_for_a/","title":"Biden picks Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for a second term as the U.S. battles Covid and inflation","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-22T15:20:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-22 15:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qzm7ni","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qzm7ni/biden_picks_jerome_powell_to_lead_the_fed_for_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qzm7ni/biden_picks_jerome_powell_to_lead_the_fed_for_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"GrapeJuicex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GrapeJuicex","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GrapeJuicex","score":2029,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"バイデン氏、ジェローム・パウエル氏をFRBの2期目のリーダーに指名、米国はコヴィドとインフレに直面しているため","the_new_excerpt":"米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）と米国経済を導いたジェローム・パウエル氏が\n前例のない金融刺激策を実施することで、驚異的で突発的なCovid-19リセッションの中で、連邦準備制度理事会と米国経済を導いた。\n米国の中央銀行の議長として2期目の指名を受けました。\n米国中央銀行の2期目の議長に指名されました。\n\nジョー・バイデン大統領は月曜日にこの発表を行いました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"拜登挑选杰罗姆-鲍威尔领导美联储的第二个任期，因为美国正在与科威德和通货膨胀作斗争","the_new_excerpt":"杰罗姆-鲍威尔(Jerome Powell)，他指导美联储和国家经济渡过了难关。\n他通过实施史无前例的货币刺激措施，引导美联储和国家经济度过惊人的、突然的Covid-19经济衰退。\n他通过实施史无前例的货币刺激政策，引导美联储和美国经济度过了惊人的、突如其来的衰退。\n担任美国中央银行主席。\n\n总统乔-拜登周一宣布了这一消息...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"拜登挑選傑羅姆-鮑威爾領導美聯儲的第二個任期，因爲美國正在與科威德和通貨膨脹作鬥爭","the_new_excerpt":"傑羅姆-鮑威爾(Jerome Powell)，他指導美聯儲和國家經濟渡過了難關。\n他通過實施史無前例的貨幣刺激措施，引導美聯儲和國家經濟度過驚人的、突然的Covid-19經濟衰退。\n他通過實施史無前例的貨幣刺激政策，引導美聯儲和美國經濟度過了驚人的、突如其來的衰退。\n擔任美國中央銀行主席。\n\n總統喬-拜登週一宣佈了這一消息...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qzccrf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qzccrf/im_a_true_boglehead_but_its_time_for_me_to_be/","title":"\"I'm a true Boglehead, but it's time for me to be reminded... why isn't real estate better?\" [BH Thread]","date":"November 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"私は真のボーグルヘッドですが、そろそろ反省しています...なぜ不動産は良くないのでしょうか？\" [BHスレッド】について］","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"我是一个真正的Boglehead，但现在是时候提醒我了......为什么房地产不是更好？\" [BH主题]","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"我是一個真正的Boglehead，但現在是時候提醒我了......爲什麼房地產不是更好？\" [BH主題]","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qzftqa","excerpt":"\"As of October 31, 2021, we had approximately 55,400 R1T and R1S preorders in\nthe United States and Canada from customers who each paid a cancellable and\nfully refundable deposit of $1,000.
