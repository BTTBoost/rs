I am not an expert and I much prefer  relying   on the work of respected voices in finance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>95%    of it is taken word for word from Prof. Aswath Damodoran&#39;s lecture    slides that he makes available for free. He teaches at NYU and has an    amazing Youtube channel with full courses on various aspects of    corporate finance. I have also sprinkled in some additional information    from other sources like Harvard Business School and others.</strong></p>\n\n<h1>The Cash Flow Statement</h1>\n\n<p>The   main objective of the Cash Flow Statement (or Statement of Cash Flows)   is to explain how much and why the cash balance of a business changed   during the period of analysis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The cash flow statement is typically broken into three sections:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating activities</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Detail   cash flow that’s generated once the company delivers its regular   goods  or services, and includes both revenue and expenses.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Investing activities</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Include   cash flow from purchasing or selling assets—think physical  property,   such as real estate or vehicles, and non-physical property,  like   patents—using free cash, not debt.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Financing activities</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Detail cash flow from both debt and equity financing.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based   on the cash flow statement, you can see how much cash different types   of activities generate, then make business decisions based on  your   analysis of financial statements.Ideally,  a company’s cash from  operating income should routinely exceed its net  income, because a  positive cash flow speaks to a  company’s ability to  remain solvent and  grow its operations.It’s  important to note that cash flow is different  from profit, which is why  a cash flow statement is often interpreted  together with other  financial documents, such as a balance sheet and  income statement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>However, you will also find other information:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How much cash earnings the company had during the period, as contrasted with accrual earnings (in income statements)</li>\n<li>How much and where the company reinvested cash during the period to sustain and grow its business</li>\n<li>How much cash it raised from or returned to its debt and equity investors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The   Cash Flow Statement preserves the signs on cash flows, with negative   cash flows shown as minuses and positive cash flows as pluses. It also   looks at cash flows through the eyes of equity investors in the company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positive cash flow</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Indicates   that a company has more  money flowing into the business than out of  it  over a specified period.  This is an ideal situation to be in  because  having an excess of cash  allows the company to reinvest in  itself and  its shareholders, settle  debt payments, and find new ways  to grow the  business.</li>\n<li>Positive   cash flow does not necessarily translate to profit, however.  Your   business can be profitable without being cash flow-positive, and  you   can have positive cash flow without actually making a profit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Negative cash flow</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Having <strong>negative cash</strong>   flow means your cash outflow is  higher than your cash inflow during a   period, but it doesn’t  necessarily mean profit is lost. Instead,   negative cash flow may be  caused by expenditure and income mismatch,   which should be addressed as  soon as possible.</li>\n<li>Negative   cash flow may also be caused by a company’s decision to  expand the   business and invest in future growth, so it’s important to  analyze   changes in cash flow from one period to another, which can  indicate how   a company is performing overall.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>No images allowed on the sub, so here&#39;s a link:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/nweKg90\"><strong>https://imgur.com/nweKg90</strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Cash Flows from Operations</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>No images allowed on the sub, so here&#39;s a link:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy\"><strong>https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy</strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Working Capital</strong></p>\n\n<p>Embedded in the cash flow from operations is the <strong>change in working capital items, excluding cash</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Non-cash Working capital = Non-cash current assets – Non-debt current liabilities</li>\n<li>An   increase in non-cash working capital will decrease cash flows, whereas  a  decrease in non-cash working capital will increase cash flows.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Non-cash   working capital ties up cash and capital, a firm with higher needs for   that working capital will have lower cash flows from operations, for  any  given level of net income, than a firm with lower needs.</p>\n\n<h1>Cash Flows from Investing</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>No images allowed on the sub, so here&#39;s a link:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8\"><strong>https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8</strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Operating or Non-operating Assets</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The   investing activities section includes investments in both operating  and  non-operating assets, except for investment in liquid, close to   riskless securities, which is treated as cash &amp; marketable   securities.</li>\n<li>The   investments into operating assets, whether internal (capex, net of   divestitures) or external (acquisitions of other companies) are the   engine that drives growth in the operating line items (revenues,   operating income etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note that acquisitions funded with stock will not show up here for obvious reasons.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The   investments into non-operating assets create a separate source of   value, where the payoff will not show up in the operating line items but   below the operating income line, as income from cross holdings or   securities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Cash Flows from Financing</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>No images allowed on the sub, so here&#39;s a link:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY\"><strong>https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY</strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Debt Cash Flows</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>While   interest expenses show up in the operating cash flow section, by   reducing net income and showing up in deferred taxes, debt repayments   are part of the financing section.</li>\n<li>To   the extent that some or all of these debt repayments are funded with   debt issuance&#39;s, the net effect on cash flows can be neutralized or   become positive.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>If   total debt increases during a period, it will represent a cash inflow,   and if it decreases, it will be a cash outflow. Companies that embark  on  plans to bring their debt down (up) over time should therefore  expect  these consequences.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Dividends and Buybacks</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Until   the 1980s, the only cash flow that was received by equity investors in   publicly traded companies was dividends. The effect of paying  dividends  is simple: it reduces the cash balance of the company and  increases the  cash in the pockets of every shareholder who receives  dividends.</li>\n<li>Starting in the 1980s, US companies have returned increasing amounts to their shareholders in the form of buybacks.\n\n<ul>\n<li>The effect of buying back stock is exactly the same as paying dividends, to the company, with cash leaving the company.</li>\n<li>For   shareholders, though, the cash flow effect is disparate. Those   shareholders who sell their shares back get cash from the company, and   those that do not get no cash, but get a larger share of the equity left   in the company.</li>\n<li>Both dividends and buybacks reduce shareholder equity on the balance sheet.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Potential Dividends (Free Cash Flow to Equity)</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>No images allowed on the sub, so here&#39;s a link:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/SLOXVS3\"><strong>https://imgur.com/SLOXVS3</strong></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/nmweb8/accounting_101_part_3_the_cash_flow_statement/","title":"Accounting 101 - Part 3: The Cash Flow Statement","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-28T14:50:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-28 14:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8d008f26-53eb-5f39-8223-88ba5a9b5105","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nmweb8/accounting_101_part_3_the_cash_flow_statement/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nmweb8/accounting_101_part_3_the_cash_flow_statement/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"oldworlds","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/oldworlds","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"oldworlds","score":166,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Accounting 101 - Part 3: キャッシュフロー計算書","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、今回はパート3です。\n\n見逃した方のために、他のパートもご紹介します。\n\nパート1：損益計算書について\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nlhcci/accounting_101_part_1_the_income_statement/\n\nパート2：貸借対照表 ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"会计101 - 第三部分：现金流量表","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，大家好，这里是该系列的第三部分。\n\n如果你错过了什么，这里是其他部分。\n\n第1部分：收益表 -\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nlhcci/accounting_101_part_1_the_income_statement/\n\n第2部分：资产负债表...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"會計101 - 第三部分：現金流量表","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，大家好，這裏是該系列的第三部分。\n\n如果你錯過了什麼，這裏是其他部分。\n\n第1部分：收益表 -\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nlhcci/accounting_101_part_1_the_income_statement/\n\n第2部分：資產負債表...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1563d3d1-e0a3-5e6e-80e1-8341cdf1fcbc","excerpt":"Hello guys!
