Right now copper mine protests are spreading in Peru, which will affect two big producers – Glencore and BHP who both partly own the Antamina copper and zinc mine.</p>\n\n<p>I placed my money on BHP and FCX, but also invested in smaller players in the industry like <a href=\"https://cumtn.com/\">Copper Mountain Mining</a> (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CMMC:TSE\">CMMC</a>), a company producing 100 million pounds of copper equivalent with all the potential to increase. They have positive results in their recent drill results at their Cameron Copper Project located in Australia. I also placed some on <a href=\"https://turquoisehill.com/\">Turquoise Hill</a> (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=NYSE:+TRQ&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRozi3w8sc9YSm9SWtOXmPU4OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLiYoOyBKT4uHj00_UNDdOrDIqL03N5FrFy-kUGu1ophAQFAgDweK_rSAAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVlprwr-3zAhVRc3AKHdfdAa8QsRV6BAhKEAM\">TRQ</a>) whose mines are in Mongolia. They recently released their production results, being able to produce 41,935 tonnes of copper, which showed an increase of 14% compared to the second quarter of 2021.</p>\n\n<p>I’m planning to invest in exploration too, and I chose a company that is already drilling and are constantly releasing good results. <a href=\"https://www.solarisresources.com/\">Solaris Resources</a> (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SLS:TSE\">SLS</a>) I think is pretty undervalued based on the momentum it has, plus their cash burn is way under too which is good. They recently had a <a href=\"https://www.solarisresources.com/news/press-releases/solaris-extends-warintza-central-to-1350m-strike-length-to-overlap-warintza-east-discovery--\">press release</a> about increasing the strike length at Warintza Central, which now overlaps the western limits of Warintza East. </p>\n\n<p>The current situation is still so volatile and I’m wondering if this might affect my recent actions of investing in these stocks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qkbzu0/i_just_invested_in_copper_stocks_should_i_be/","title":"I just invested in copper stocks.
