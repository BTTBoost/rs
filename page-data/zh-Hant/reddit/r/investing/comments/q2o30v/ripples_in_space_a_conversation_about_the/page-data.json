As we see more companies look to winding down property leases to increase their bottom line, there&#39;s 9.2 million jobs and $1.14 trillion in GDP potentially impacted by this shift (Source: <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/b2b/cre/story/2021-06-15/commercial-development-and-operations-a-key-catalyst-for-u-s-economic-growth\">L.A. Times</a>).</p>\n\n<p>So, the big question is what that shift looks like. There&#39;s the possibility of repurposing commercial space as retail and residential but that would take many years of rezoning, permits, retrofits, etc., and so some inefficiencies would arise, and the near term effect would still be a net decline in real estate value.</p>\n\n<p>There will obviously also be some spaces retained for core staff, executive offices, meeting spaces, etc., but as the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/30/how-venture-capitalists-are-deforming-capitalism\">WeWork fiasco</a> demonstrated, the rank and file seem to be much more amenable to working from home than so-called dedicated coworking spaces.  How might this provide relief to related sectors, such as housing shortages with residential population booms? What does it do for income inequality?</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t have a particular perspective that I&#39;m sharing here, but rather raising the topic for discussion.  What are your thoughts on opportunities, risks, etc., that we might be looking at, over the next decade or two, as the remote office wave permanently transforms the way we work.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q2o30v/ripples_in_space_a_conversation_about_the/","title":"Ripples in Space: A Conversation about the Transforming Landscape of Commercial Real Estate","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-06T22:21:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-06 22:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q2o30v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q2o30v/ripples_in_space_a_conversation_about_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q2o30v/ripples_in_space_a_conversation_about_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"th3cr1t1c","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/th3cr1t1c","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"th3cr1t1c","score":74,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Ripples in Space: 変貌する商業用不動産の現状を語り合う","the_new_excerpt":"PwCからのお知らせ\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-pwc-tells-us-employees-they-need-never-return-office-2021-09-30/]\n全社員にリモートワークを許可すると発表しました。多くの企業が不動産賃貸契約の終了を検討しています。\n企業が収益向上のために不動産リースの終了を検討する中、920万人の雇用と\n万人の雇用と...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"空间的涟漪。关于商业地产转型的对话","the_new_excerpt":"普华永道刚刚宣布\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-pwc-tells-us-employees-they-need-never-return-office-2021-09-30/]\n他们允许所有员工进行远程工作。当我们看到越来越多的公司寻求\n随着我们看到越来越多的公司寻求减少财产租赁以增加他们的底线，有920万个\n万个工作岗位和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"空間的漣漪。關於商業地產轉型的對話","the_new_excerpt":"普華永道剛剛宣佈\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-pwc-tells-us-employees-they-need-never-return-office-2021-09-30/]\n他們允許所有員工進行遠程工作。當我們看到越來越多的公司尋求\n隨着我們看到越來越多的公司尋求減少財產租賃以增加他們的底線，有920萬個\n萬個工作崗位和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q2hxc2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2hxc2/this_retard_fraudulently_borrowed_4_million_from/","title":"This retard fraudulently borrowed $4 Million from the PPP loan program and then blew it shorting the market.
