Alibaba’s shares have slumped 29% this year compared to a fall of just under 7% for the Hang Seng Index. </p>\n\n<p>The selloff has prompted some global fund managers including Cathie Wood to dump their holdings in Chinese stocks over the past few months. In fact, some investors are questioning allocations toward Chinese assets altogether.</p>\n\n<p>The new moves are incremental but investors are not at a point where they “will cease to price in any more additional policies,” said Shine Gao, fund manager at Taicheng Capital Management Co. “Even if the worst is over for big tech firms in terms of new regulations, we should expect that their growth won’t be what it was.”</p>\n\n<p>The Hang Seng Index fell as much as -2% Thursday.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/p77sea/alibaba_baba_shares_hit_new_all_time_low_in/","title":"Alibaba (BABA) shares hit new all time low in overseas markets.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-19T07:33:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-19 07:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a27f22c6-3cae-5139-baff-0cf8929fbf61","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p77sea/alibaba_baba_shares_hit_new_all_time_low_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p77sea/alibaba_baba_shares_hit_new_all_time_low_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Avid_Hiker98","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Avid_Hiker98","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Avid_Hiker98","score":916,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アリババ（BABA）の株価は、海外市場で史上最安値を更新しました。","the_new_excerpt":"アリババ・グループ・ホールディング・リミテッドの株価は、4.3％も下落して過去最安値を記録しました。\n香港では、アリババ・グループ・ホールディングの株価が4.3％下落し、史上最安値を記録しました。\n中国政府が新たな規制を導入したことで、中国のテクノロジー企業の売りが拡大しました。\n\nこの規制により、中国のテクノロジー企業の市場価値は1兆ドル近くも下落しました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"阿里巴巴（BABA）股价在海外市场创下历史新低。","the_new_excerpt":"阿里巴巴集团控股有限公司股价周四在香港跌幅高达4.3%，创下历史新低。\n周四香港股市下跌，延续了中国科技巨头的跌势。\n北京以新一轮的监管措施打击该行业。\n\n打击行动使中国企业的市值减少了近1万亿美元。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"阿里巴巴（BABA）股價在海外市場創下歷史新低。","the_new_excerpt":"阿里巴巴集團控股有限公司股價週四在香港跌幅高達4.3%，創下歷史新低。\n週四香港股市下跌，延續了中國科技巨頭的跌勢。\n北京以新一輪的監管措施打擊該行業。\n\n打擊行動使中國企業的市值減少了近1萬億美元。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1428162800803844098","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1428162800803844098","title":"40% OF ALL COVID CASES IN BOSTON ARE VACCINATED *","date":"August 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ボストンでのコヴィド感染者の40％はワクチン接種を受けています。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"波士顿40%的科威德病例都接种了疫苗 *","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"波士頓40%的科威德病例都接種了疫苗 *","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-21e5fea2-73fe-59ab-a2c5-bf3e575521ce","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p6yv6f/7_downsides_to_passive_investing_and_why_it_can/","title":"7 Downsides to Passive Investing and Why it Can Be Bad for Your Portfolio - (What did I just read?)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 19, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"7 Downsides to Passive Investing and Why it Can Be Bad for Your Portfolio（パッシブ投資の7つの欠点と、それがポートフォリオに悪影響を及ぼす理由） - (What did I just read?)","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"被动投资的7个缺点以及为什么会对你的投资组合不利 - （我刚刚读了什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"被動投資的7個缺點以及爲什麼會對你的投資組合不利 - （我剛剛讀了什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-a27f22c6-3cae-5139-baff-0cf8929fbf61","previousId":"TweetPost-1428162800803844098","nextId":"RedditPost-21e5fea2-73fe-59ab-a2c5-bf3e575521ce","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/p77sea/alibaba_baba_shares_hit_new_all_time_low_in/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
