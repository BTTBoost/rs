Being an investor, you most likely picked high-quality businesses that you are proud to be an owner of, and which will most likely transcend the economy because of their convincing quality, management, moat, growth etc. It&#39;s all about creating wealth even for generations to come over many years, and this is what great businesses will always help you to accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>In this regard, don&#39;t worry when your portfolio takes a few nose dives every now and then. Even if the next stock market crash is going to be tomorrow at 3PM EST (sounds about right, doesn&#39;t it?) and you lose 50% of your hard-earned money, see this as a major opportunity to load up even more on businesses you love and are proud to own. Keep calm and do not sell anything at the worst times, which undoubtedly is during these short-term drawbacks.</p>\n\n<p>TDLR: Take a deep breath, don&#39;t overreact (I mean just look at SPY, it&#39;s almost as high as ever right now), trust in the businesses you own, and see even major pullbacks as life-changing opportunities to buy more shares.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pyfu9h/remember_what_investing_is_all_about/","title":"Remember what investing is all about","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-30T14:22:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-30 14:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pyfu9h","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pyfu9h/remember_what_investing_is_all_about/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pyfu9h/remember_what_investing_is_all_about/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"fabi9922","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fabi9922","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"fabi9922","score":167,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投資とは何かを考える","the_new_excerpt":"こんにちは、投資家の皆さん（この言葉に聞き覚えのある方も多いでしょう！）。\n\nというのも、このサブレディットで、マクロ経済学上の問題を心配するいくつかの投稿を偶然見つけたからです。\nこのサブレディットで、今起こっているマクロ経済的なノイズや混乱を心配するいくつかの投稿を見つけたので、私は皆さんにすぐに思い出させたいと思いました。\n真の投資とは何か、トレーディングではなく、すべては...を皆さんに素早く思い出していただきたいと思います。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"记住投资的意义所在","the_new_excerpt":"各位投资者朋友们，大家好（很多人可能会认出这句话！）。\n\n因为我在这个分论坛上偶然发现了几个帖子，担心现在所有的\n担心现在的宏观经济噪音和干扰，我只想快速提醒大家，真正的投资--不是交易--是什么？\n快速提醒大家什么是真正的投资--而不是交易--是所有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"記住投資的意義所在","the_new_excerpt":"各位投資者朋友們，大家好（很多人可能會認出這句話！）。\n\n因爲我在這個分論壇上偶然發現了幾個帖子，擔心現在所有的\n擔心現在的宏觀經濟噪音和干擾，我只想快速提醒大家，真正的投資--不是交易--是什麼？\n快速提醒大傢什麼是真正的投資--而不是交易--是所有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1443441825541468161","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1443441825541468161","title":"BIDEN PROPOSES A \"DRIVING TAX\" OF 8 CENTS PER MILE.
