T<em>he disclosure should give short sellers (meaning financial institutions which have betted or are still betting on a falling share price in Volkswagen)</em> the opportunity to settle their relevant positions without rush and without facing major risks. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For <strong>ONE DAY ONLY</strong> VW became the most valuable company in the world, at the time the company it passed was ExxonMobil. Remember this is during the 2008 financial crisis. VW stock went to $1,000 a share. </p>\n\n<h1>What does this mean for GAINZSTOP? Since that only had a 12.6% short interest, and GAINZSTOP is over 100% will the stock go to $50,000 a share?!?!?!?!?!??!?! 🚀🚀🚀🌗🌗🌗🚀🚀🚀🌗🌗🌗🚀🚀🚀🌗🌗🌗🚀🚀🚀🌗🌗🌗</h1>\n\n<p>No, $GME will never get to $50,000 a share, sorry to break it to you. If you set a limit order that high, it won&#39;t get filled. If you&#39;re account is a cash account not on margin...it doesn&#39;t mean someone can&#39;t borrow your shares. But a lot of that info needs to be in another post because it is quite long to explain. </p>\n\n<p>So $GME is a different situation for many reasons. When you look at who the shareholders of VW were you see it was Porsche, a Gov. Fund and Index Funds....those accounted for over 75% of the total outstanding shares. When Porsche upped its stake to 74% there were virtually no shares available to be sold. <strong>Porsche, an Index Fund, and a Gov. Fund had</strong> 💎👐💎.</p>\n\n<p>Gstop insiders (executives) have sold off some shares, over 1mm shares. Not a big deal right? Well....this isn&#39;t the same as the situation above because those holding the shares simply wouldn&#39;t sell. It makes no sense for them to, it&#39;s like a set it and forget it type of thing. In order for gstop to be as similar as possible, every single person who owns a share would have to refuse to sell....and that&#39;s not likely and we know that from the volume of shares happening. You&#39;re also going to be up against significantly more sophisticated trading algo&#39;s now than in 2008 who are scalping throughout the day. </p>\n\n<h1>ARE YOU TELLING ME $GME ISN&#39;T GOING TO BE $10,000 A SHARE?</h1>\n\n<p>Yes, I am. However...it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not possible for it to go to $1,000 a share. This week will be telling in a lot of ways on how this can play out. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, not everyone who has a short position has had it since the stock was under $40, under $15, under $4. New short positions have come in at many price points....there could be some who got in over $400 a share....in that case, those would be up right now. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s impossible to know what will happen, where the short positions are held and I think it&#39;s likely that Hedge Funds will get regulation in the future where they would need to disclose more similar to how an ETF does (For the ARK fans who get their position email updates each day...something like that).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l9fabu/in_2008_volkswagen_in_an_infinity_squeeze_the/","title":"In 2008 Volkswagen 🚀🚀🌗🌗 in an \"infinity squeeze\".
