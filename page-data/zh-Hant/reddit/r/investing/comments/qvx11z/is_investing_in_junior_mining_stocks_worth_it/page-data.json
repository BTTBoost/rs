They are a small producer but a good thing about them is that they have no debts. They recently increased their dividend by 14%, and reported positive results in their Golden Mile property.</p>\n\n<p>I included <a href=\"https://www.threevalleycopper.com/\">Three Valley Copper</a> (TVC) since they’re showing great potential too. They announced a financing with a deal brought about by investor demand, financing the company with $16 million dollars. They are expected to start mining early 2022 and will potentially produce 13-16 thousand tonnes of copper cathodes in a few years.</p>\n\n<p>I’m still looking into other juniors to add to my bigger mining stocks but some peers have been encouraging me to hold physical metals as well. I’m not really sure about this though. It would help me a lot if you guys share your thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qvx11z/is_investing_in_junior_mining_stocks_worth_it/","title":"Is investing in junior mining stocks worth it?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-17T13:30:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-17 13:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qvx11z","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qvx11z/is_investing_in_junior_mining_stocks_worth_it/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qvx11z/is_investing_in_junior_mining_stocks_worth_it/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ProfessionalHornet54","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ProfessionalHornet54","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ProfessionalHornet54","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qvo2a3","excerpt":"I'm not currently in NVDA right now, and I'm probably just going to watch\nearnings from the sidelines, but it'll certainly be interesting to see how the\nstock performs during the day tomorrow, and then obviously what's going to\nhappen in afterhours.\n\nNormally, I'd think that anything even remotely…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qvo2a3/nvda_tomorrow_your_thoughts/","title":"NVDA tomorrow... your thoughts?","date":"November 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"明日のNVDA...あなたの考えは？","the_new_excerpt":"私は今、NVDAに投資しているわけではありませんし、おそらく決算を傍観するだけでしょう。\n傍観しているだけですが、今年の春先にNVDAがどのような動きを見せるかは興味深いところです。\n明日の日中に株価がどのように推移するか、そして当然ながらアフターアワーに何が起こるか、興味深いところです。\nしかし、明日の日中に株価がどのように推移するかは興味深いところです。\n\n通常、私はどんなことでも、少しでも...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"明天的NVDA...你的想法是什么？","the_new_excerpt":"我现在不在NVDA中，我可能只是从旁观看\n我可能只是从旁观者的角度看一下收益，但看看NVDA的表现肯定会很有趣。\n明天白天的股价表现，然后显然是盘后的情况。\n发生在盘后。\n\n通常情况下，我认为任何事情，即使是远程...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"明天的NVDA...你的想法是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"我現在不在NVDA中，我可能只是從旁觀看\n我可能只是從旁觀者的角度看一下收益，但看看NVDA的表現肯定會很有趣。\n明天白天的股價表現，然後顯然是盤後的情況。\n發生在盤後。\n\n通常情況下，我認爲任何事情，即使是遠程...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qvp7du","excerpt":"I know that Ford has a big investment in Rivian.
