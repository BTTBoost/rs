Since stocks have higher historical return deviations they’re seen as being more risky, but you can use leverage to elevate the returns of bonds such that they mirror the risk level of equities with a different set of inverse correlations (hence making the portfolio robust to different macro circumstances depending on whether stocks were rising and bonds falling as the economy recovers or stocks falling and bonding rising during downturns). There’s a lot more nuance to this, especially considering various inflationary environments and incorporating real assets but that is the overall gist.</p>\n\n<p>Notably though, the risk-parity approach gas come under heat in recent years for not performing as well as expected for a number of reasons such as bonds having a downside asymmetry since they cannot appreciate significantly more without producing negative yields (which has happened in Europe but the Fed has expressed an interest in avoiding in the U.S) and correspondingly a reduction in the inverse correlation between stocks and bonds (last march both treasuries and equities sold off during a liquidity crunch rather than bonds serving as a safe haven which they eventually did largely due to help from the Fed).</p>\n\n<p>Dalio has famously written books and essays on what he refers to as the long term debt cycle where monetary standards are set after the changing of a world order, in this case following world war 2 with the emergence of U.S global supremacy. In these cycles reserve currencies ultimately rely on monetary polciy increasingly to offset economic downturns until rates cannot be lowered anymore, which is essentially where we are now.</p>\n\n<p>So, all that being said, do you all believe that the inverse correlation between stocks and bonds is set to deteriorate thus yielding  risk parity portfolios and even 60/40 portfolios massively over exposed to risk? Or will can rates keep falling and reach negative territory? Could it be possible that the portfolio theory can be modified to adjust risk for something other than bonds and yield the same success? Would love to hear some thoughts and debate</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oi8rp2/can_risk_parity_work_as_an_investment_strategy/","title":"Can risk parity work as an investment strategy with near-zero interest rates?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-12T01:52:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-12 01:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9647d487-d64e-5f6c-9ac0-58396b9d23f9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oi8rp2/can_risk_parity_work_as_an_investment_strategy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oi8rp2/can_risk_parity_work_as_an_investment_strategy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"somalley3","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/somalley3","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"somalley3","score":79,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゼロに近い金利の中で、リスクパリティは投資戦略として機能するのか？","the_new_excerpt":"私は前学期、上級投資のクラスで最終論文を書きました。\nブリッジウォーターのオールウェザー・ポートフォリオとその中のリスク・パリティ・アプローチについて最終論文を書きました。\nこの革新的な戦略を研究することは非常に魅力的であった。\nこの革新的な戦略を研究することは非常に興味深く、伝説的な投資家であるレイ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在利率接近零的情况下，风险平价能否作为一种投资策略发挥作用？","the_new_excerpt":"上学期我在高级投资课上写的期末论文是关于\n桥水公司的全天候投资组合，更具体地说，他们在该组合中的风险平价方法\n他们在该投资组合中的风险平价方法，研究这一创新策略非常吸引人。\n研究这种创新的策略是非常吸引人的，它使传奇的投资者雷...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在利率接近零的情況下，風險平價能否作爲一種投資策略發揮作用？","the_new_excerpt":"上學期我在高級投資課上寫的期末論文是關於\n橋水公司的全天候投資組合，更具體地說，他們在該組合中的風險平價方法\n他們在該投資組合中的風險平價方法，研究這一創新策略非常吸引人。\n研究這種創新的策略是非常吸引人的，它使傳奇的投資者雷...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1414058424875290624","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1414058424875290624","title":"Full vaxxed french actress Lea Seydoux May Cancel Trip to Cannes After Testing Positive for Covid **\n\nSuch a great vaccine","date":"July 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"Full vaxxed french actress Lea Seydoux may cancel trip to Cannes after testing positive for Covid **.\n\nこのような素晴らしいワクチン","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"全程打疫苗的法国女演员莱雅-赛杜在对科维德检测呈阳性后可能取消戛纳之旅 **。\n\n这么好的疫苗","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"全程打疫苗的法國女演員萊雅-賽杜在對科維德檢測呈陽性後可能取消戛納之旅 **。\n\n這麼好的疫苗","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-79792471-0863-5b0b-9ae6-41bc4071105c","excerpt":"TLDR at bottom\n\nI decided to try a back testing experiment where I would look at current and\nrecent operations of a company ($GIL: Gildan) and come up with my own five year\nestimates for growth taking into account quantitative and qualitative factors.\nThe process was to look at old financials and…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ohx82a/back_testing_growth_predictons/","title":"Back testing growth predictons","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 12, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"成長予測のバックテスト","the_new_excerpt":"下部のTLDR\n\n私はバックテストの実験をすることにしました。\n定量的、定性的な要因を考慮して、ある企業（$GIL: Gildan）の現在と最近のオペレーションを見て\n定量的、定性的な要因を考慮して、自分なりの5年間の成長予測を立てるというバックテストをやってみることにした。\nその過程で、昔の財務状況を見て、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"回测增长预测","the_new_excerpt":"底部的TLDR\n\n我决定尝试一个回测实验，我将查看一家公司（$GIL: Gildan）当前和最近的运营情况，并提出我自己的五年计划。\n观察一家公司（$GIL: Gildan）的当前和近期运营情况，并根据我自己的五年\n增长的估计，并考虑到定量和定性的因素。\n这个过程是看旧的财务数据和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"回測增長預測","the_new_excerpt":"底部的TLDR\n\n我決定嘗試一個回測實驗，我將查看一家公司（$GIL: Gildan）當前和最近的運營情況，並提出我自己的五年計劃。\n觀察一家公司（$GIL: Gildan）的當前和近期運營情況，並根據我自己的五年\n增長的估計，並考慮到定量和定性的因素。\n這個過程是看舊的財務數據和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-9647d487-d64e-5f6c-9ac0-58396b9d23f9","previousId":"TweetPost-1414058424875290624","nextId":"RedditPost-79792471-0863-5b0b-9ae6-41bc4071105c","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oi8rp2/can_risk_parity_work_as_an_investment_strategy/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
