And was asked to post this as a discussion.</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing is actually <strong>until Friday there</strong> will be another <strong>price</strong> battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .<br/>\nIt is particularly critical because <strong>monthly and weekly calls</strong> expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was <strong>60c 1/29</strong> and <strong>115c 1/29</strong> (left out the new 200c).</p>\n\n<p>The MM will try everything to push the course <strong>below 60</strong> , <strong>our goal to get to 115</strong> . Until then, <strong>expect massive short attacks</strong> , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don&#39;t be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.<br/>\nFor those of you who don&#39;t know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 &lt;$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.</p>\n\n<p>And almost most importantly <strong>, put your stop loss out</strong> , the <strong>shortsellers try</strong> to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger <strong>a chain reaction of panic selling</strong> .</p>\n\n<p>Remember <strong>yesterday we saw exactly that</strong> , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.</p>\n\n<p>Should we be <strong>able to hold the $ 115 by Friday</strong> , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility 🚀✋🏻💎🤚🏻,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Don&#39;t be a paper bitch!</strong></p>\n\n<p>All figures relate to estimates and information or assumptions and observations from DD from here and the Angelsachen forum. Due to the high trading volume, it is not possible to say how the share is currently distributed !!</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is not a financial advice, but an autistic one.</strong> <strong>Always invest wisely and make your own decisions.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And now relax America won&#39;t open for another 4 hours anyway.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/l56ov7/gamestop_sammelfaden_january_26_2021/gkt8z0q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/l56ov7/gamestop_sammelfaden_january_26_2021/gkt8z0q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5fsbw/gme_listen_to_this_german_guy_the_most_important/","title":"GME - Listen to this german guy: The most important thing until Friday.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T22:53:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 22:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"bda99379-62bc-577a-98ee-99fc47695308","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5fsbw/gme_listen_to_this_german_guy_the_most_important/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5fsbw/gme_listen_to_this_german_guy_the_most_important/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Pr333n","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pr333n","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Pr333n","score":11849,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME 听听这个德国人。周五之前最重要的事情。","the_new_excerpt":"刚从德国wsb翻译了一些东西。并被要求将此作为一个\n讨论。\n\n最重要的是，其实直到周五还会有一个价\n在这场战役中，卖空者会尽量保留更多的看涨期权。\n价外，使其无法执行，而...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME 聽聽這個德國人。週五之前最重要的事情。","the_new_excerpt":"剛從德國wsb翻譯了一些東西。並被要求將此作爲一個\n討論。\n\n最重要的是，其實直到週五還會有一個價\n在這場戰役中，賣空者會盡量保留更多的看漲期權。\n價外，使其無法執行，而...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3f4471b1-0f54-5b73-aa3a-a46d95bf3541","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5nphz/gme_yolo_update_jan_26_2021/","title":"GME YOLO update — Jan 26 2021","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME YOLO更新-2021年1月26日。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME YOLO更新-2021年1月26日。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2a2d4cf0-b949-5ab7-bb80-1412eb577752","excerpt":"― Quarterly revenue of $3.24B up 53% year-over-year; Full year revenue of $9.76B\nup 45%; quarterly and full year net income more than doubled from prior year ―\n\nAMD smashed its 4th quarter EPS and revenue consensus.
