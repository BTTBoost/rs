I did a bit of a quick research into this recently. But first, a quick recap of what Warren Buffet says about investing in IPOs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Warren Buffet has always been very vocal about his views on IPOs. His thought process is that &quot;<em>there are always better businesses to buy than IPOs</em>&quot;. He always compares IPOs with other alternatives in the market, and so far, he has not found a strong justification for investing in an IPO versus another solid business at a good price.</li>\n<li>Buffet also dislikes the fact in IPOs, there are commissions that go to the stock salesmen, remember that IPOs are executed by investment banks so there is a push to sell IPOs like any other product, He likes to buy stocks where &quot;<em>no one is making any money on the sale</em>&quot;.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to share with you some stats that I put together. Bear in mind the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I took the <a href=\"https://www.iposcoop.com/scoop-track-record-from-2000-to-present/\">full list</a> of IPOs in the last 20 years from iposcoop.com.</li>\n<li>Filtered only companies that went public between years 2000 and 2015, so that at a minimum we have at least 5-6 years of post IPO performance.</li>\n<li>Calculated annualized performance using stock price from the first day close of IPO and current stock&#39;s price at the time this video was made.</li>\n<li>Performance from companies that are not currently trading were excluded.</li>\n<li>List <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/102ArUr35s1MLfyMm6rwnqhCvSo-L5f4JrmHAUlyk1pg/edit#gid=1482717621\">here</a> for your reference.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Results</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Total number of companies: 1396</li>\n<li>45% of the companies (qty 616) have had negative annualized performance.</li>\n<li>14% of the companies (qty 189) had sub 5% performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Almost 60% of IPOs between 2000 and 2015 underperformed the market.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I also came across an <a href=\"https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf\">academic study</a> on Initial Public Offerings by Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the Warrington College of Business in the University of Florida. One piece of information that caught my attention in his paper is Figure number 2, labeled Percentage of IPOs with negative EPS. If you check the figure, you&#39;ll notice how in recent years <strong>over 75% percent of the companies that have gone public have had negative earnings.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you buy shares of companies, you get a piece of the ownership and therefore a piece of the earnings . Well, with IPOs in the recent years, in 75% of the cases there is no earnings for your shares. You are literally investing with the expectation that the company will become profitable, which by the way is already factored into the price that you are paying. So if these new public companies fail to turn a profit, or perhaps if their path to profitability takes longer, the stock price will suffer. Your only chance is the company continuously beating expectations. Not to mention that you don&#39;t even have enough years of financial reports to build a solid foundation for analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. I don&#39;t want to discourage anyone though, a lot of people have made good money on IPOs, but base on the data it&#39;s pretty obvious that the average investor should stay away from them.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qm7rx5/should_you_invest_in_ipos/","title":"Should you invest in IPOs?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-04T07:22:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-04 07:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qm7rx5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qm7rx5/should_you_invest_in_ipos/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qm7rx5/should_you_invest_in_ipos/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"indivinvest","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/indivinvest","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"indivinvest","score":109,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"IPOに投資すべきか？","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、もしあなたがIPOや、近年IPOした企業への投資を考えたことがあるなら\nこの記事はあなたのためのものです。私は最近、このことについてちょっとした\n調べてみました。その前に、ウォーレン・バフェットがIPO投資について言っていることを簡単にまとめてみました。\nIPOへの投資について。\n\n * ウォーレン・バフェットは、常に...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你应该投资于IPO吗？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们，如果你曾经考虑过投资于IPO，或那些已经上市的公司\n的公司，那么这篇文章就是为你准备的。我最近做了一些快速\n最近对此进行了研究。但首先，快速回顾一下沃伦-巴菲特所说的\n关于投资IPO的看法。\n\n *沃伦-巴菲特一直是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你應該投資於IPO嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們，如果你曾經考慮過投資於IPO，或那些已經上市的公司\n的公司，那麼這篇文章就是爲你準備的。我最近做了一些快速\n最近對此進行了研究。但首先，快速回顧一下沃倫-巴菲特所說的\n關於投資IPO的看法。\n\n *沃倫-巴菲特一直是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qlz8ih","excerpt":"Taking a serious look at buying ATVI some time in the next month or so.\n\n1) Could be a beneficiary of tax loss selling.
