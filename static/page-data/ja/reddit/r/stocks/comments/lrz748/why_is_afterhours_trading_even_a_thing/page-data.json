Most regular investors doesn&#39;t have the ability to trade after hours so we just sit there and watch the stock go up or down and powerless to do literally anything at all while institutions and rich people are allowed to trade freely?</p>\n\n<p>How come it works like this?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I see that you can get access to after hours trading, but again - why is that even a thing? Why not restrict the trading between 08-16 or just allow everyone to purchase/sell during after hours? I live in Sweden so I invest through something called an &quot;Investeringssparkonto&quot; which you tax like 0,375% on the total value of the account and instead of 30% of the profits and we can&#39;t trade during AH with those accounts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","title":"Why is afterhours trading even a thing?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T11:22:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 11:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"98c87950-d1a8-5f8e-b237-eded979f7526","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"pm_me_you_in_latex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pm_me_you_in_latex","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"pm_me_you_in_latex","score":248,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么盘后交易还能成事？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我是新的投资生活，我只是一直在想，为什么收市后的\n交易甚至是一个东西？大多数普通投资者并没有能力来\n交易后的时间，所以我们只是坐在那里，看股票上涨或下跌和\n无力做任何事情，而机构和富人... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼盤後交易還能成事？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我是新的投資生活，我只是一直在想，爲什麼收市後的\n交易甚至是一個東西？大多數普通投資者並沒有能力來\n交易後的時間，所以我們只是坐在那裏，看股票上漲或下跌和\n無力做任何事情，而機構和富人... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-38dab7e5-3506-5890-b993-0541f82e2faf","excerpt":"Results for the quarter\n\nParticular Q421 (In millions) Q420(In millions) % Revenue 5000 3105 61% Gross\nmargins 63.1% 64.9% Net income 1457 950 53%\n\nResults for the year\n\n\n\nParticular FY21 FY20 % Revenue 16675 10918 53% Gross Margins 65.6% 62.5% Net\nIncome 62700 3580 75%\n\n\n\nQ122 Projections\n\nRevenue…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lrycl1/nvidia_q4_earnings_release/","title":"Nvidia Q4 Earnings release","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Nvidia第四季度财报发布","the_new_excerpt":"本季度业绩\n\n第421季度(百万元) 第420季度(百万元) 收入百分比 5000 3105 61% 毛额\n利润率 63.1% 64.9% 净收入 1457 950 53%\n\n本年度的成果\n\n\n\n21财年20财年%收入16675 10918 53%毛利率65.6% 62.5%净利率\n收入 62700 3580 75%\n\n\n\n问题122预测\n\n收入...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Nvidia第四季度財報發佈","the_new_excerpt":"本季度業績\n\n第421季度(百萬元) 第420季度(百萬元) 收入百分比 5000 3105 61% 毛額\n利潤率 63.1% 64.9% 淨收入 1457 950 53%\n\n本年度的成果\n\n\n\n21財年20財年%收入16675 10918 53%毛利率65.6% 62.5%淨利率\n收入 62700 3580 75%\n\n\n\n問題122預測\n\n收入...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e6e2660d-fcde-5e02-ad06-b4a08e160643","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrrrod/return/","title":"Return","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"返回","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"返回","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-98c87950-d1a8-5f8e-b237-eded979f7526","previousId":"RedditPost-38dab7e5-3506-5890-b993-0541f82e2faf","nextId":"RedditPost-e6e2660d-fcde-5e02-ad06-b4a08e160643","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrz748/why_is_afterhours_trading_even_a_thing/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
