People tend to say that stocks are riskier but can lead to stronger gains than ETFs/index funds, which tend to be slower and less volatile. However, I’ve seen several ETFs (ARKK, YOLO, DRIV, etc.) show massive gains over the past 1 and 5 year periods (80-100% and 150+% respectively). This growth sounds just as strong, if not stronger than regular long-term stock holdings, while the volatility and risk is greatly reduced. I’m almost leaning toward 90% of my portfolio being solely ETFs and 10% being more risky individual stocks. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone agree/disagree? Can anyone lend some advice?
