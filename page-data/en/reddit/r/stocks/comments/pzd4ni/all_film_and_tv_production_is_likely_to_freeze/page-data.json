In all likelihood, we&#39;ll see all US-based TV and film shoots come to a screeching halt in October. My thesis is that this will likely result in a short-term decline in NFLX, DIS, T and CMCSA as they&#39;re the four largest parties in the AMPTP (trade organization for producers). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/iatse-strike-authorization-vote-explainer-1235076384/\"><strong>What IATSE is striking for</strong></a>, according to Variety:</p>\n\n<p>The industry has long expected workers to put in 14-hour days during production, if not longer. The shift to streaming and the explosion of demand has only sped up the pace. Before, workers might have expected weeks of downtime between shows. Now they can jump from one show to the next. Workers complain of exhaustion, and of being too tired to drive home safely.</p>\n\n<p>The union is seeking a 10-hour minimum “turnaround” — the time between production days — for all workers on all types of productions. The union negotiators argue that workers need a minimum of eight hours at home, plus an hour each way to commute to set. Some classifications have that already, but others have only eight- or nine-hour turnarounds.</p>\n\n<p>The unions are also seeking a minimum 54-hour turnaround on weekends. That would put an end to the dreaded “Fraturday” — a late-Friday shift that ends on Saturday morning. They also want to dramatically increase meal penalties, which are the payments that productions are obligated to provide if workers do not get a meal break. For many workers, a production will have to pay $8.50 for the first half-hour without a meal, $11 for the second half-hour, and then $13.50 for each half-hour after that. Those payments can work out to hundreds of extra dollars a week — though at the cost of having to eat standing up or skipping meals entirely. Unions have suggested increasing those payments as much as threefold, as a way of forcing studios to actually take the meal break, rather than just budgeting in the penalties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What will shut down?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Almost everything. There are three contracts in play — the Basic Agreement, the Area Standards Agreement and the Videotape Agreement. The Basic Agreement applies to the 13 “West Coast” IATSE locals, which represent about 47,000 workers. Three of those locals are nationwide: the International Cinematographers Guild, Local 600, the Motion Picture Editors Guild and the Art Directors Guild. The Area Standards Agreement covers another 15,000 to 20,000 workers at 23 locals around the country, including production hubs such as Georgia, Louisiana and New Mexico. Those workers are also voting on a strike authorization. The Videotape Agreement covers certain TV shows, like talk shows, reality shows, game shows, or “Dancing With the Stars.” The Basic Agreement and the Area Standards Agreement expired on Sept. 10, and the Videotape Agreement expires on Thursday night. All together, those contracts cover the vast majority of film and TV production across the country, and if a strike is called, all work covered under those contracts would cease.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzd4ni/all_film_and_tv_production_is_likely_to_freeze/","title":"All film and TV production is likely to freeze this month and the markets are ignoring it.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-02T15:33:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-02 15:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pzd4ni","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzd4ni/all_film_and_tv_production_is_likely_to_freeze/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzd4ni/all_film_and_tv_production_is_likely_to_freeze/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"BigLeJaffe","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigLeJaffe","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BigLeJaffe","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"すべての映画やテレビの制作が今月中に凍結されそうだが、市場はそれを無視している。","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: 映画の現場で働く多くの労働者を代表する組合、IATSEが\nストライキ承認の投票を開始しました。この業界で働いている者としては\nこの業界で働く者として、私はそれが可決されることを確信しています。おそらく、私たちはすべての\n10月にはアメリカのテレビや映画の撮影が停止してしまうでしょう。私の考えは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"所有的电影和电视制作都可能在这个月冻结，而市场对此视而不见。","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: IATSE，代表大多数线下电影工人的工会，已经\n已经开始就罢工授权进行投票，作为一个在这个行业工作的人，我确信它将会通过。\n我确信它将会通过。在所有的可能性中，我们将看到所有的\n美国的电视和电影拍摄将在10月戛然而止。我的论文...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"所有的電影和電視製作都可能在這個月凍結，而市場對此視而不見。","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: IATSE，代表大多數線下電影工人的工會，已經\n已經開始就罷工授權進行投票，作爲一個在這個行業工作的人，我確信它將會通過。\n我確信它將會通過。在所有的可能性中，我們將看到所有的\n美國的電視和電影拍攝將在10月戛然而止。我的論文...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pzvyzi","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzvyzi/diamond_hands_to_the_moon_painting/","title":"Diamond hands to the moon painting","date":"October 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"月に向かってダイヤモンドの手を描く","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"钻石之手献给月亮的画","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"鑽石之手獻給月亮的畫","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pzk05h","excerpt":"TL;DR: Rising bond yields means investors should rotate from growth to value.\nAvoid ARK ETFs at all costs, they have underperformed for a reason.
