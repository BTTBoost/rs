Literally every shared portfolio, due diligence and stock opinion is finshed with the I invest for the long term, so I do not really care about the price fluctuations. </p>\n\n<p>Yet the sheer panic and mood changes on stocks are made after every small dip, missed earnings or change in analyst estimates. </p>\n\n<p>The thing is, that the value of company and mass concensus here is not made by anything, but simple price change. </p>\n\n<p>The company’s stock rose singnificantly in the last year?</p>\n\n<p>It is a complete beast and literally everyone needs it in their portfolio!</p>\n\n<p>They missed earnings by 50 basis points, there is small change in the estimates for next year and the stock had not changed in a 6 months?</p>\n\n<p>Immediately sell the company, because you are lacking after the last year biggest homeruns!</p>\n\n<p>The reason why this thing is happening is, because most people do not know or have the slightest idea about how much they value their business! </p>\n\n<p>If you would have a strong opinion on how much you value your business, you want sell it after you believed that you have paid 50 cents on a dollar for it. Most of you are valueing business on the market price that is quoted last second. </p>\n\n<p>The other thing is that you do not understand the businesses you own!</p>\n\n<p>No, saying Iunderstand Coca-Cola because i know it sells Coke is not understanding business. How many of you know the balance sheet of KO, how many of you read the 10Q and 10K, do you know that KO’s payout ratio of their dividends is above 80% and often was 100% plus? Do you know the management? Can you give a pricetag on these cash flows, that KO will make? </p>\n\n<p>And this is talking about KO, which is relatively easy to understand company, that nearly everyone has some experience with. I really do not believe that even 0,1% of people who read palantirs reports, looked at its valuation, and most importantly understand the business of the company.</p>\n\n<p>Answer honestly to yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Do you really know the business you own?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly i would want to say a story about mass opinions on companies. Microsoft and Apple were for many years considered mature companies with limited growth. Apple was even considered with negative growth rate. After last three years rally in their prices, the opinion on them changed so much that literally everyone believes that they must have them in their portfolio. </p>\n\n<p>Would you also consider this if the price of the stock did not change?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qxg8e6/you_do_not_understand_your_stocks_and_you_do_not/","title":"You do not understand your stocks and you do not know the value of them.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-19T18:29:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-19 18:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qxg8e6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qxg8e6/you_do_not_understand_your_stocks_and_you_do_not/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qxg8e6/you_do_not_understand_your_stocks_and_you_do_not/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"mouserino","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mouserino","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mouserino","score":195,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"あなたは自分の株を理解しておらず、その価値もわかっていません。","the_new_excerpt":"このサブ記事を読んでいて最もよく見かけるフレーズは、「長期投資」です。\n長期的な投資です。文字通り、すべての共有ポートフォリオ、デューデリジェンス、銘柄の意見は\n私は長期投資をしているので、価格の変動はあまり気にしません」という言葉で締めくくられています。\n価格の変動は気にしません。\n\nそれなのに、パニックになったり、気分が変わったりするのは...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你不了解你的股票，你不知道它们的价值。","the_new_excerpt":"在这个子栏目中，最受欢迎的短语是为长期投资。\n长线投资。从字面上看，每个共享的投资组合、尽职调查和股票意见\n都是以 \"我是为了长期投资 \"作为结尾，所以我并不真正关心\n价格的波动。\n\n然而，纯粹的恐慌和情绪变化......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你不瞭解你的股票，你不知道它們的價值。","the_new_excerpt":"在這個子欄目中，最受歡迎的短語是爲長期投資。\n長線投資。從字面上看，每個共享的投資組合、盡職調查和股票意見\n都是以 \"我是爲了長期投資 \"作爲結尾，所以我並不真正關心\n價格的波動。\n\n然而，純粹的恐慌和情緒變化......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qxjwg0","excerpt":"This\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/]\npost about copper miners just hit the top of this subreddit, and it's a good\nexample of the obvious astroturfing effort that's going on.\n\nTake a look at this account's post…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qxjwg0/theres_an_extremely_blatant_astroturfing_effort/","title":"There's an extremely blatant astroturfing effort to promote mining-related stocks on this and other investment subreddits","date":"November 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"このサブレディットや他の投資サブレディットでは、鉱山関連銘柄を宣伝するための極めて露骨なアストロターフ活動が行われています。","the_new_excerpt":"この\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/]\n銅鉱山労働者に関するこの投稿は、このサブレディットのトップを飾ったばかりで、明らかなアストロターフ活動の良い例です。\nこれは、明らかにアストロターフ活動が行われていることを示す良い例です。\n\nこのアカウントの投稿を見てみましょう...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在这个网站和其他投资子网站上，有一个极其明目张胆的天马行空的努力，以促进采矿相关的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"这个\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/]\n关于铜矿工的帖子刚刚登上了这个分论坛的顶部，它是一个很好的\n这是一个很好的例子，说明了正在进行的明显的天马行空的努力。\n\n看一下这个账户的帖子...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在這個網站和其他投資子網站上，有一個極其明目張膽的天馬行空的努力，以促進採礦相關的股票。","the_new_excerpt":"這個\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxeym8/buying_copper_stocks_now_that_prices_are_taking_a/]\n關於銅礦工的帖子剛剛登上了這個分論壇的頂部，它是一個很好的\n這是一個很好的例子，說明了正在進行的明顯的天馬行空的努力。\n\n看一下這個賬戶的帖子...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qxknuz","excerpt":"(I'm copying this post from my post on /r/investing here\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxjwg0/theres_an_extremely_blatant_astroturfing_effort/]\nsince it seems like I can't cross-post.
