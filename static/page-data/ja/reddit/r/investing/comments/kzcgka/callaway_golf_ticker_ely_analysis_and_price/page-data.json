For anyone who is familiar with golf or Topgolf&#39;s venues, I believe this merger makes ELY&#39;s stock very undervalued and I wanted to do some DD and analysis to come up with a reasonable price target. </p>\n\n<p>Callaway is currently projected to do $1.55B in revenue in 2020 with an expected growth rate of 10.5% for future years while Topgolf will do revenues of about $1.1B while experiencing a 30% growth rate since 2017. This 30% growth can continue for many years to come as the company is still rapidly growing and expanding its venues. Also, over half of Topgolf&#39;s customers consider themselves non-golfers so this gives Callaway a huge market to bring in new customers to their golf apparel and equipment revenue streams.

I then discounted this revenue back to current year at 15% to get a number of about $3.3B. With ELY currently trading at a P/S ratio of 1.51, this would imply a target market cap of about $4.98B with the discounted revenues and the current P/S ratio. The current market cap of ELY with the stock trading at $27/share is $2.54B. <strong>Based on my analysis this gives a potential upside of 96% with a price target of $52.85.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thoughts??</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kzcgka/callaway_golf_ticker_ely_analysis_and_price/","title":"Callaway Golf (Ticker ELY) Analysis and Price Target after TopGolf Acquisition","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-18T13:22:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-18 13:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b77b7771-06c0-5e5c-b244-a8fc64090d51","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kzcgka/callaway_golf_ticker_ely_analysis_and_price/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kzcgka/callaway_golf_ticker_ely_analysis_and_price/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Healthy-Cash8610","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Healthy-Cash8610","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Healthy-Cash8610","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"卡拉威高尔夫(股票代码ELY)分析和收购TopGolf后的目标价。","the_new_excerpt":"早在10月份，卡拉威高尔夫公司就宣布了与Topgolf的合并，这就是\n估值为20亿美元。对于熟悉高尔夫或Topgolf的场地的人来说。\n我相信这次合并使得ELY的股票被非常低估，我想做一些。\n丈量和分析，得出一个合理的价格... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"卡拉威高爾夫(股票代碼ELY)分析和收購TopGolf後的目標價。","the_new_excerpt":"早在10月份，卡拉威高爾夫公司就宣佈了與Topgolf的合併，這就是\n估值爲20億美元。對於熟悉高爾夫或Topgolf的場地的人來說。\n我相信這次合併使得ELY的股票被非常低估，我想做一些。\n丈量和分析，得出一個合理的價格... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b0176b3f-a2c5-5c49-b04e-25e30abb6435","excerpt":"I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue.
