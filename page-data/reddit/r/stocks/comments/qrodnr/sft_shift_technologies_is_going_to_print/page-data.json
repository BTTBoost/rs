Their timing (mostly by sheer luck) could not have been more perfect. More importantly, they specifically have amassed a huge inventory of what were previously 10-20k cars to appeal to the lower/middle income demographic. This range has appreciated more than any range of used vehicle. We’re talking 50-60% from a couple years ago in many cases. Best part is, used car prices continue to skyrocket as supply shortages and inflation show no signs of retreat. At some point the carousel will stop but until then I think Shift will experience rapid growth and profitability.</p>\n\n<p>Anecdotally, I have heard more and more people talk about buying from Shift, and it’s relative ease compared to Carvana.</p>\n\n<p>Shift is rapidly stealing market share from Carvana, yet is valued at only 600mil to Carvana’s 49Bil valuation.
