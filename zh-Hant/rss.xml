&lt;p&gt;When the clock stuck midnight on Nov. 29, tickets for ‚ÄúSpider-Man: No Way Home‚Äù went on sale. Within minutes domestic movie ticket sites began to crash as moviegoers rushed to snag seats for one of the most anticipated films of the year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is something that the box office has not experienced since the pandemic began and a sign that with the right releases, the movie theater industry has a ‚Äúbright future,‚Äù experts say.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic battered cinemas, crushing demand and nearly bankrupting some of the industry‚Äôs largest exhibitors. The box office has been slow to rebound, but sustained momentum over the last six months has provided confidence in an eventual recovery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight, the latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a co-production between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS&quot;&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, has sparked even more optimism. Ticketing sites like Atom Tickets, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA&quot;&gt;Fandango&lt;/a&gt; and MovieTickets.com alongside movie theater sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMC&quot;&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CNK&quot;&gt;Cinemark&lt;/a&gt; and Regal saw a surge of demand for tickets leading many to crash or place visitors in hour-long online queues.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThere are different tiers of intense fan demand when it comes to box office pre-sales, and this film is clearly showing it belongs near the top with a select few others,‚Äù said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ‚ÄúFor anyone who doubted the communal draw of the theatrical experience over the past two years, look to this enthusiasm for ‚ÄòSpider-Man‚Äô as a major inflection point during the box office recovery period and the sign of a bright future ahead.‚Äù  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of fervor has not been seen at the box office since 2019 when advanced tickets for titles like ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame‚Äù and ‚ÄúStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker‚Äù went on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following an extremely volatile, holiday-shortened week, stocks rebounded on Monday, driven higher by a huge bounce in technology, as market participants grapple with the potential implications of the newly discovered ‚ÄúOmicron‚Äù coronavirus variant. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed higher after its worst day since October 2020, as the price of oil, which suffered its worst day all year, somewhat rebounded. While it is way too early to make any conclusions, I am personally looking at this dip as a potential buying opportunity in equities that were overstretched before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients, ‚ÄúUltimately this is not the first or last variant scare and our tech playbook over the last 18 months has been to use these macro/risk-off events as buying opportunities to own the tech sector specifically cloud, cyber-security, and 5G winners. While we are seeing a return to normalcy, a semi-remote workforce environment we believe is here to stay which underscores our tech cloud thesis into 2022 that the digital transformation build-out will be accelerated and is not a one time COVID pull forward event&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and EU have banned a host of destinations to ban flights from several African countries after the new variant was discovered. But cases of the variant, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far designated as a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529&quot;&gt;variant of concern&lt;/a&gt;-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern),&amp;quot; have also detected in regions including the U.K., Hong Kong, Australia, Germany and Italy, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is still much that needs to be studies regarding the Omicron variant, Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), the two largest producers the current COVID vaccine, asid they are already working to adapt current inoculations for the new variant and that, if a tailor made vaccine is necessary, would be completed relatively quickly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/moderna-says-an-omicron-variant-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-early-2022.html&quot;&gt;Moderna‚Äôs Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said a new vaccine to address the Omnicron variant &lt;/a&gt;would be widely available in early 2022 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omicron-covid-19-variant-pfizer-184458407.html&quot;&gt;Pfizer said it could take about 100 days to have a tailor made vaccine widely available.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden said of the new variant, ‚Äúhis variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic. We have the best vaccines in the world, the best medicine, the best scientists, and we‚Äôre learning more every single day. We have more tools today to fight the variant than we ever have before.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite concerns present in the market, consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, continues accelerating. While supply-chain disruptions could lead shoppers toward in-stock items at physical stores this year, I think overall spending will see a healthy increase. The National Retail Federation (NRF) is forecasting an 8.5%-10.5% increase in holiday sales this year, compared with 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest reading shows the personal savings rate is 7.5% (savings as a % of disposable income), the third-highest rate coming into Thanksgiving in the last quarter century. While this is down dramatically from the spike during the pandemic lockdowns (when consumers were unable to consume), the savings rate remains notably above the long-term average of 6.5% (6.1% excluding 2020). We think elevated savings will be drawn down, representing additional dry powder that will power consumer-spending growth for an extended period. At 4.2%, wage growth is now the highest it&amp;#39;s been since Thanksgiving of 2007, providing additional fuel for consumers. Looking back over the last 25 years, when wage growth was above 4% and accelerating, GDP growth averaged 3.2%, compared with an average of 2.5% over the entire period, according to a report by Edward Jones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chief Executive Satya Nadella sold about half of his shares in the company last week, according to a federal securities filing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001513142/000106299321011647/xslF345X03/form4.xml?campaign_id=4&amp;amp;emc=edit_dk_20211129&amp;amp;instance_id=46511&amp;amp;nl=dealbook&amp;amp;regi_id=90401093&amp;amp;segment_id=75585&amp;amp;te=1&amp;amp;user_id=b1b6731f732a5b8d7bb632a925fe64b9&quot;&gt;In the filing last week&lt;/a&gt; with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Redmond, Wash.-based software company reported Mr. Nadella sold 838,584 shares over two days, down from close to 1.7 million shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Dorsey announced he will be stepping down as CEO of social media Twitter (TWTR), giving the lead role to Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal. In my opinion, this is good news for Twitter, given they will now have more focused leadership. Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Square (SQ) has a lot on his plate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nissan Motors announced it was planning to spend $18 billion over five years to accelerate growth of their EVs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of Alibaba (BABA) stock fell to its lowest level in four years amid the continued regulatory push by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tencent (TCEHY) will further open their super-app WeChat, with over 1.2 billion users in China, and allow links to external shopping sites like Alibaba. This was a new regulation instituted by the CCP in order to encourage competition among the big tech firms. Previously, apps in China did not allow competitor links in their platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russia will continue slowing down the speed of Twitter on mobile devices until all content deemed illegal is deleted, state communications regulator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note price target upgrades were written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Deere (DE) with three target raises. Stock currently around $350

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evercore ISI from $354 to $415 at Outperform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deutsche Bank from $375 to $398 at Hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stifel Nicolaus from $430 to $445 at Buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marvell Technology (MRVL) with two target raises. Stock currently around $75

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JP Morgan from $74 to $85 at Overweight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B. Riley from $83 to $90&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pfizer (PFE) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $50 to $60 at Equal Weight. Stock currently around $53&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snowflake (SNOW) target raised by BTIG Research from $353 to $421 at Buy. Stock currently around $366&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zscaler (ZS) target raised by Needham from $345 to $390 at Strong-Buy. Stock currently around $354.&lt;/li&gt;

That¬¥s my second analysis for AAPL, the last one was from May. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I¬¥ll try to answer everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we will look through the basics of Apple¬¥s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock using discounted free cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let¬¥s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around &lt;strong&gt;50%&lt;/strong&gt; of their sales comes from the &lt;strong&gt;iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Mac&lt;/strong&gt; makes up around &lt;strong&gt;11%&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;iPad&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;9%&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;19%&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Wearables, Home and Accessories&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;11%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the valuation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take &lt;strong&gt;analyst estimates&lt;/strong&gt;, we discount that by our &lt;strong&gt;required return of 8%&lt;/strong&gt;. Then we use the &lt;strong&gt;perpetual growth rate of 2,5%&lt;/strong&gt; and that gave us a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock of &lt;strong&gt;$99 per share&lt;/strong&gt;. But because we have to account for &lt;strong&gt;Apple¬¥s debt&lt;/strong&gt; as well, our &lt;strong&gt;fair value of equity&lt;/strong&gt; would be &lt;strong&gt;$94 per share&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Apple¬¥s price being at &lt;strong&gt;$160&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;per share&lt;/strong&gt; right now, it¬¥s a little too high. That¬¥s why I don¬¥t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That¬¥s where you invest every month the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where I see Apple¬¥s stock price in 5 years.&lt;/strong&gt; We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the &lt;strong&gt;Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Estimated Growth Rate&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Future P/E Value&lt;/strong&gt;. With this method I get a stock price of &lt;strong&gt;$293 per share&lt;/strong&gt; which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That¬¥s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I¬¥ll do.&lt;/strong&gt; I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That¬¥s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to &lt;strong&gt;dollar-cost-average&lt;/strong&gt;. That way I don¬¥t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don¬¥t double in 5 years, I¬¥m rather bullish on this company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and I hope I¬¥ll see you again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Inflation Bets Give a Boost to Small-Cap Stocks
Smaller companies can manage inflationary pressures more quickly than larger ones, say investors who are seeking refuge from price increases&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 12th: Barrons 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/cheap-small-company-stocks-51636763053&quot;&gt;https://www.barrons.com/articles/cheap-small-company-stocks-51636763053&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-Cap Stocks Are in Line to Be Big Winners in 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the 1 month chart and it&amp;#39;s been a steady drop since these 2 articles happened. Very frustrating as I went all in on small caps and they are easily my biggest losers especially on a day like today with the market super up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 12th, there has been only ONE day the Index went up (by a measly 5 points), every other day has gone down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company IMHO is so undervalued at this price and has much room to go up, HIMX had strong revenue and earnings growth in the last 4 quarters, but the stock price did not act accordingly, and I believe this growth will continue due to chip shortage, and the transformation in the global economy to electric cars, in 2030 most of the big cars brands are expected to stop producing diesel cars and produce only electric cars, this is regardless the already existed electric cars brands like Xpeng, Nio, Tesla etc. this will cause constant demand on chips and more production and revenue for HIMX and other semiconductor stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/u5g0jy7vvk281.png?width=485&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=12c95a4227644109ca4be596b4ce38d3a91b3ff1&quot;&gt;HIMX Revenue and Earnings over the last 4 quarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below a comparison between AMD and HIMX performance for the last 4 quarters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.HIMX Revenue growth ................  AMD Revenue growth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q4 2020 $276M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15%&lt;/strong&gt; ----- Q4 2020 $3.24B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q1 2021 $309M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt; ------ Q1 2021 $3.45B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +7%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q2 2021 $365M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +18%&lt;/strong&gt; ------- Q2 2021 $3.85B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q3 2021 $421M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15% -------&lt;/strong&gt; Q3 2021 $4.31B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;....................HIMX...........AMD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price to Earnings ............ 5.35 .................... 49.23&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price to Sales  ..................1.29  ....................12.76&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book value per share .....$4.17!! ü§Ø  ...........$5.89!! ü§Ø&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current ratio  ...................2.01 ...................... 2.24&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD is definitely bigger name than HIMX but I used this comparison just to show how HIMX is growing on the same pace as AMD, how it has healthy statistics, and how cheap its valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO HIMX is a solid play and a bargain at this price, the only thing that is holding back the stock price is the possible conflict between China and Taiwan, but if that happens, all the market will tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conservative prediction is that One year from now assuming normal market conditions HIMX price will be at least $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also 15% short interest add some spice to the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my last word is, see you on the moon üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üåô üåô üåô&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off with vanguard (buying into life strategy 100% + sp500 fund), however I felt limited with my options and opened up a fidelity account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been depositing monthly into my fidelity account and into various different funds, Which I regret because I clearly have no idea what I&amp;#39;m doing... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funds have an average fee of 0.5% and I think this is quiet high (correct me if I am wrong). + the account fee + platform fee... this, over time, will eat into the value of my assets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing today to get a second opinion and a bit of guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

The discovery of the variant resulted in one of the worst Black Friday trading sessions in recent memory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.98%, the S&amp;amp;P 500 index SPX, 1.62% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 2.08% all tumbling by at least 2%, but Ackman‚Äôs comments suggest that investors‚Äô knee-jerk response may have been an overreaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond yields on Friday also fell as prices for government debt saw a rush to the perceived safety of Treasurys on the back of fresh concerns about new restrictions that could result from a strain of COVID that the World Health Organization on Friday designated a variant of concern. However, stocks were bouncing back on Monday and the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.528% was up 8 basis points at 1.56%. Prices for Treasurys fall as yields rise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, is known for his lucrative COVID wager. The Financial Times reported back in 2020 that the investor cashed out on bet that netted him a $2.6 billion profit on a $27 million at risk, on the premise that insurance premiums would soar during the height of the 2020 COVID pandemic as economies locked down. He also later in 2020 said that he placed bearish bets on corporate credit on the day that Pfizer PFE, -0.64%  and BioNTech BNTX, 3.65% released positive trial data on their COVID-19 vaccine, which triggered a whipsaw rally in stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ackman was wagering that the vaccines would lead to mask-wearing complacency. However, that bet presumably turned out wrong as markets continued to surge in the aftermath of those vaccines. The danger posed by the omicron variant isn‚Äôt yet fully understood, even though governments in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas immediately restricted travel from southern Africa. Vaccine manufacturers have said that they are examining the variant closely and note that the current batch of remedies might still prove effective against the strain and new vaccines could be readied in early 2022 if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Take bigger risks when you are young. When you are in your 20‚Äôs its fine to go heavy in high risk/high reward stocks. But this is flawed reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is taking big risks when you are young is more risky because of opportunity costs. People always mention compounding interest over decades. But fail to apply this to investing in risky stocks when you are young. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say you are 20 years old and you have $10k to invest. Its common to hear people say you can be more risky since you are so young. And even if you do YOLO and lose it all you can easily recover. But think opportunity cost. What did you really lose doing a YOLO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$10,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invest in an index fund that returns 8.5% annualized return &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Withdraw at 65 years old&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That $10k becomes $400k. So you basically lost $400k because you YOLOed on a risky stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hold till 70 you lost $600k. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 90 you can give your children and grandchildren $3.2 million. Or you could have fun and lose it all on a risky stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is a young persons greatest asset is TIME. Throwing investment time away by taking unnecessary risk is a massive mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt buy stocks that are risky hyper growth companies. But also don‚Äôt gamble needlessly. Because you are gambling much more than that couple hundred or thousand you see next to the stock ticker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave Clark, Amazon‚Äôs CEO of worldwide consumer, told CNBC on Monday that the company is on track to become the nation‚Äôs largest delivery service by the end of 2021 or early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts have long predicted Amazon would overtake carriers like UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service, thanks to its increasingly in-house network of planes, trucks, vans and ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a positive development as Amazon dependence on other carriers will be lessen. The logistic and warehouse networks are in a optimal mode now as Amazon has been invested heavily to fight off the competition. This proves that the investment cycle has finally paid off as patience investors will be holding the amazon stocks and waiting for the next stock appreciation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sofi &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own Tesla because.... It is Tesla. People in my honest opinion want to believe they will only be making vehicles in the future. Not the case if Elon Musk gets his way (check out the Tesla bot for example, not to mention space travel, etc). Before today held 2 shares of Tesla, plan on buying 2 more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is a good long term buy and hold because it is Apple of course. I do not believe the Apple car that should be releasing in the next 3 years has been priced in to the stock at all yet. I could see Apple being worth over $500/share say 3 years from now. Before today held 14 shares of Apple, plan on buying 10 more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sofi is an underdog stock. I could see this stock going much further down, possibly to/below $10 a share again. Sofi is by definition loosing money, and it is the outlier compared to say a Tesla or an Apple stock... However I see it as being revolutionary when it comes to financial products for the everyday person. As a millennial most of my friends from around the United States seem to know more about Sofi than Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, etc. I would be shocked if Sofi is not worth $40 a share this time next year. Before today held 48 shares, will be buying 25 more today, and will wait for a potential dip below $12 - if that happens will buy as many shares as I can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me if I am missing anything with these stocks, and for us readers in similar situations, maybe a few stocks to consider purchasing in lieu of any of the above 3?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO and Coronavirus experts around the world are calling this morning for countries to drop travel restrictions and end the mass hysteria and instead be cautiously optimistic as initial reports out of South Africa suggest the new Omicron variant is not more lethal than the previous Delta variant. In fact, there have been no reports of hospitalisations or deaths as a result of anyone being diagnosed with Omicron. Most patients merely experience a severe headache, nausea, dizziness and a high pulse rate, according to hospitals and medics across Southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the news of the new variant, first reported in South Africa, led to mass hysteria around the world: markets thumbed and dozens of countries imposed travel restrictions and additional checks, including the UK, US, EU, Israel, Australia and Japan after the new mutation popped up in the UK, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic and Israel among other countries. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said this reaction was ‚Äúmedically seen, not justified.‚Äù A GP for over three decades, and chair of the South African Medical Association, she was the first African doctor to suggest to local authorities Covid had mutated into a new strain. Coetzee called the response from many European countries, including the UK, ‚Äújust a hype.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa‚Äôs health minister Joe Phaahla also said the majority of cases of Omicron seen by doctors in his country have been ‚Äúmild‚Äù. He added he has heard from GPs that the ‚Äúmajority of the people they‚Äôve been seeing are mild.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur clinicians have not witnessed severe illness. Part of it may be because the majority of those who are positive are young people,‚Äù Dr Paahla added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter investors seem to like this, but interesting that SQ is flat. You&amp;#39;d think this would be good for SQ since he can now focus on just that company and not divide his attention.&lt;/p&gt;

In my opinion, the biggest hurdle to the company&amp;#39;s trading performance is due to the Canadian adult recreational industry wide challenge along with covid-related retail headwinds. There&amp;#39;s been struggles for the Canadian cannabis LPs to generate growth organically within the adult recreational segment. For example, while Tilray, market leader in Canadian adult recreational, generated 26% topline growth from $405 million in 2020 to $513 million in 2021, much of that topline growth is derived from acquisitions. In other words, Tilray&amp;#39;s recent revenue growth were &amp;quot;bought&amp;quot; instead of generated organically as the market expands. Low growth within the segment along with some structural challenges and covid-related shut-downs further negatively impacted the industry&amp;#39;s outlook and profitability, resulting in depressing trading performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cannabis companies remain illegal in the United States at a federal level and debt capital raising are off the table as a result, Canadian cannabis LPs relies on equity issuance to fund acquisition opportunities to &amp;quot;grow&amp;quot; their toplines. Result of both stagnant growth and share dilution, Tilray traded down from $40 in February 2021 to $10 last close. Tilray&amp;#39;s TTM EV/Sales declined from 40x to 10x. For a growth company within a quickly expanding market that&amp;#39;s only 3 years old, 10x TTM sales EV is a good price in my opinion. What makes it even more attractive is that there&amp;#39;s a catalyst that the market has dismissed and forgotten that will completely derail the stagnant market growth narrative for Tilray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany&amp;#39;s new coalition government has recently reached a deal that&amp;#39;s set to legalize recreational cannabis use. As a result, German pot stocks popped last week on Frankfurt exchange. For example, German cannabis company Synbiotic rose by 33% to $29 Euro, which implies a $100mm market cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the market has forgotten however is that Canadian cannabis LP Tilray is actually the market leader in the Germany&amp;#39;s cannabis market. But the stock didn&amp;#39;t move last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I know the market made a mistake instead of &amp;quot;everything has been priced in&amp;quot; narrative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy. First, almost every German pot companies moved up last week. The fact that Tilray didn&amp;#39;t change at all suggests that whoever was making market genuinely forgot that Tilray is a market leader in the German cannabis market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if we assume status quo on Tilray&amp;#39;s 10x EV/Sales multiple, which is a very conservative assumption because we&amp;#39;re completely dismissing the potential of a new, 3-days old, 83 million population addressable market. And if we proxy $90 million of additional revenue, which is another very conservative assumption as Tilray generated $90 million in revenue after Canada legalized their adult recreational cannabis market in 2018; Conservative because German population doubles of Canadian. With the conservative multiple assumption while holding other variables constant, just by adding the additional $90 million in revenue, we should expect Tilray trade up by at least 30%. The fact that it didn&amp;#39;t trade up at the slightest suggests whoever was making market was sleeping in his office after he had his turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Tilray is production and distribution ready. Tilray operates two state-of-art facilities in Portugal and Germany with over 3 million square feet of production capacity. Tilray also owns and operates one of the largest market cap pharmaceutical company, CC Pharma, in Germany. Because of the company&amp;#39;s production and distribution capacity, institutional support, larger balance sheet, domestic moms &amp;amp; pops cannabis producers in Germany aren&amp;#39;t like to able to compete against Tilray in the immediate 24 months of legalization, allowing Tilray to secure market leadership. Again, this echoes with why assume only $90 million of revenue and 10x EV/Sales is a very conservative estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forth, there has been consistencies showing that the cannabis MTM is very inefficient. Most of you are aware that there were a squeeze with the Canadian cannabis LPs that took place in February. It was driven by Democrats winning the election, investors bet in favour that recreational cannabis use will be legalized in the U.S. It was similar to what&amp;#39;s happening today; similar but different. What&amp;#39;s similar is that both are political driven catalyst and market has gotten it completely wrong. Different was that last time Tilray were traded up for the wrong reason, Tilray has minimal operations in the United States, while they&amp;#39;re already a market leader in the German cannabis market with operations and infrastructures that are unmatched by their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, let me know if I got it wrong. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks are most likely to be accepted as prudent at the moment they are not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only invest what you could afford to lose without that loss having any effect on your daily life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t overestimate the skill and wisdom of professionals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take advantage of what you already know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for opportunities that haven&amp;#39;t been discovered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in a home first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in companies, not the stock market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore short term movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting the economy is futile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting the short term movement of the stock market is futile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long term stocks have outperformed bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average person is exposed to local companies years before wall street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the stock market, one in the hand is worth 10 in the bush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Any idiot can run this business&amp;quot; is one characteristic of the perfect company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in companies that make products people need to keep buying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the company insiders are buying, you should too. Management normally sells 2.3 shares for every 1 share they buy. In 1987 after the crash, it was 4 buys for 1 sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry, any stock being touted as the next X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A share of stock is NOT a lotto ticket. It is a part ownership of a business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E ratio can be thought of as the number of years to earn back your original investment. IE = P/E of 10 would be 10 years assuming earnings stay constant. Ratios tend to be lower for slow growers and highest for the fast growers with cyclicals in between depending on the current cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at average P/E ratios on the company you are researching and peers going back several years to determine if it is a good buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid stocks with HIGH P/E ratios. They must have incredible earnings growth to justify the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E ratio that is half the growth rate (annual earnings) is very positive and one that is twice the growth rate is very negative. IE = P/E of 10 should be growing at 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formula = Growth rate plus dividend yield divided by P/E. IE = 12% growth + 3% yield/10 P/E = 1.5. Less than 1 is bad. 1.5 is ok and 2+ is great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market as a whole has its own collective P/E ratio, which is a good indicator of weather the market at large is over or under valued. If some stocks are selling at inflated prices relative to earnings, then it could be likely most stocks are selling at inflated prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rates have a large effect on p/e ratios as investors pay higher p/e when interest rates are lower and bonds less attractive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend paying stocks keep the stock price from falling as far as if there was no dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You CAN&amp;#39;T predict future earnings. Wall Street has battalions of analysts trying to do this and they are wrong a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Flow ‚Äì amount of money a company takes in as a result of doing business. You want to buy companies that don&amp;#39;t need to spend a lot of money to make money IE = company spends 20 million to make 100 million is better than one that needs to spend 90 million to make 100 million. Formula = $20 stock with $2 per share annual cash flow has a 10-1 ratio which is standard (10%). $20 stock with $4 CF = 20% return on cash. Focus on free cash flow ‚Äì what is left over after normal capital spending is taken out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt to equity ratio - normal is 25% debt to 75% equity but higher equity % is better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

In FY21&amp;#39; Costco did $192 Billion in sales from their 815 warehouses globally. Additionally, 61.7 million households have active Costco memberships, bringing Costco another $3.9 billion in membership fees alone, all with a 91.3% renewal rate. Let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at Costco from an investment standpoint.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco P/E Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco&amp;#39;s historical P/E hovers around 32x - 35x. Costco&amp;#39;s current P/E ratio sits around 48x which is decently high considering its&amp;#39; historical averages. The increase in Costco&amp;#39;s TTM and current P/E ratio is due to Costco&amp;#39;s stock price appreciating by 44%~ in the last six months alone. I expect Costco&amp;#39;s stock price to stabilize or fall slightly in 2022 as the P/E ratio returns to normal values as long as Costco&amp;#39;s earnings continue to grow. The recent Covid variant could affect Costco&amp;#39;s performance moving into 2022 if the areas where they operate return to lockdown, primarily US and Candian storefronts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco Free Cash Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco continues to increase their FCF with TTM values sitting around $6 billion. This is ~45% increase in FCF when compared to their 3Y FCF value around $4.2 billion. Costco&amp;#39;s ability to keep increasing free cash flow will ensure they can pay creditors and contributes to the safety of their dividend. Although not guaranteed, Costco has paid special dividend three out the last six years. This is a nice bonus to shareholders considering Costco&amp;#39;s yield is sub one percent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco Profit Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco has historically kept their profit margins right around 2%. The TTM value sits just below 2.5% which is strong indicator for Costco that customers are returning to stores post Covid. 2.5% may not seem like a high number but remember Costco generated around $192 billion in sales last year, meaning they produced a profit on that around $4.8 billion. Couple that with their membership fees as they have healthy sustainable margins.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costco Dividend Yield &amp;amp; Dividend Yield on Cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco&amp;#39;s dividend yield, as of 26 November 2021, sits at .58% which is the lowest it&amp;#39;s been when compared to historical averages. Again, this is attributed to Costco&amp;#39;s stock price appreciation of ~44% over the last six months. This is another indicator that Costco shares may be overvalued and you should wait to invest. Costco currently pays $3.16 in dividends per share per year. Absent a dividend increase Costco&amp;#39;s price would need to drop to around $430 per share to realign its dividend with the 3Y average. It&amp;#39;s unlikely that Costco is going depreciate by 22% from its current $550 per share value. Costco&amp;#39;s Yield on Cost is where you as an investor can get your return on investment when it comes to building passive income. Costco has a high compound annual growth rate (CAGR) around 13% meaning if you had bought Costco 15 years ago your YOC would be above 6%! Considering Costco has routinely increased their dividend at a rate higher than average you can see your dividends increase quickly without having to invest more capital. This is one of the reasons I decided to invest in Costco. Costco has been increasing their dividends for the past 17 years and I expect that trend to continue as they move closer to joining the dividend aristocrat list.  Costco spends approximately $1.4B per year to maintain their dividend. This and the growth associated appears safe considering Costco&amp;#39;s ability to maintain and increase free cash flow and profit margins.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividend Payout Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Lastly, Costco&amp;#39;s dividend payout ratio sits around 27% with an average around 29-31%. This is significantly lower that most dividend companies including some long-standing dividend aristocrats. Costco is only paying around 30% of its earnings out as dividends meaning they have money available to continue funding further expansion in the future. Costco has strong track record of consistently increasing earnings YoY which contributes to their ability to maintain a stable dividend payout ratio. This will also ensure they are able to continue growing their dividend in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Costco is a great growth stock that also pays a dividends. Currently, however, Costco is overvalued. Looking at the current FIBs I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect the price to fall below the .786 FIB at $502. If you are looking to add to your position or start a new position I would wait for a pullback in December or early 2022. Costco is overvalued when you compare both Dividend Yield and P/E ratios with their historical values. I also expect Costco to raise their dividend in 2022 so getting in prior to the increase will help boost your yield on cost so you could always invest now if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re look for. I&amp;#39;ll be watching Costco&amp;#39;s price action over the next month or so to find a good entry point to expand my current position.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps everyone! Happy Investing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have open positions in Costco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming someone carrying Omicron antibodies is immune to the Delta strain, a new non lethal strain taking over the world and replacing Delta would be the ideal way to end this pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging Omicron to spread is going to spread delta-immunity across the 3rd world much faster than vaccines ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we won‚Äôt really know for a couple of weeks just how deadly this strain is, but if early reports are true and it does turn out to be non-lethal this could be massive for the world and of course markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Anything else is speculation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculators attitude toward stock market movements lies in trying to anticipate and profit from market fluctuations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investor&amp;#39;s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unintelligent speculation is speculation when you think you are investing, any trades done on margin, doing it seriously instead of a pastime, risking more than you can afford to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are going to speculate, put a small amount aside and don&amp;#39;t add money because you are up. Understand that you in fact are speculating and be prepared to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying IPOs or &amp;quot;Hot&amp;quot; stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defensive Investor ‚Äì Interested in safety and freedom from bother. Purchase investment funds vs creating a stock portfolio, use investment counsel firm, or dollar-cost average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggressive Investor ‚Äì To enjoy a reasonable chance of success, the investor must follow policies which are sound and promising and are NOT popular on Wall Street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must be either a defensive/conservative investor or an aggressive/enterprising investor. You can&amp;#39;t be 50/50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculative stock movements are carried too far in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Savings Accounts can also be a good choice in lieu of bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do NOT buy on margin. You are speculating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the investors funds are placed into high grade short maturity bonds (&amp;amp;lt;7 years), he will not be affected by market prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longer term bonds and equities will vary during his lifetime and he must be prepared for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment of most intelligent when it is most businesslike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defensive Investor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred Stocks are not usually a good investment. It carries no share in the company&amp;#39;s profits beyond a fixed dividend. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal claim of a bondholder (Creditor) and the profit possibilities of a common stockholder (Partner). You are dependent on the ability and desire of the company to pay dividends on its common stock. They are under no obligation to pay you unless they pay the common shareholder. This investment vehicle is better for corporations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The choice of a corporate bond vs tax free municipal bond is made by the tax rate payed by the individual. Example ‚Äì If a municipal pays 30% less than a corporate bond. The investor was at a tax bracket above 30% he would have a net saving by choosing the municipal bond. The opposite is true if the tax was below 30%. Usually tax-free bonds are better for individuals in high tax brackets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only invest in high quality bonds ‚Äì AAA, AA, A. Do NOT invest in lower quality (2nd grade) issues to get a higher return. Stay away from high yield &amp;quot;Junk Bonds&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules for Defensive Common Stock Component ‚Äì A. Adequate diversification but not excessive B. Company should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed C. Long record of dividend payments D. Have a limit on the price willing to pay. Say 25x average earnings over the last 7 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defensive investors should usually stay away from Growth Stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the most persuasive test of high quality is uninterrupted record of dividend payments for the last 20 years or more. The defensive investor might be justified in limiting his purchases to those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock Selection ‚Äì Adequate size, strong financial condition (Current ratio 2/1), positive earnings for the past 10 years, uninterrupted dividends for the past 20 years, EPS growth of at least 33% in the past 10 years, P/E of less than 15 for the last 3 years earnings, current price not more than 1.5x book value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short vs Long Maturity Bonds ‚Äì if the investor wants to assure himself against a decline in the principal of his bond but at the cost of a lower annual yield and loss of possibility of a gain in principal, pick short maturity bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might be best for the conservative investor to concentrate on issues selling at a close approx. to their tangible asset value (book value). Say not more than 1/3 above that figure. Consider this a premium an extra fee paid for the advantage of a stock exchange listing and ability to quickly sell/buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But just because a stock is selling for its book value doesn&amp;#39;t make it a good investment. The investor should demand a satisfactory P/E ratio, strong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk of paying too high a price for good quality issues is not the chief hazard confronting the average invest. Observation is that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low quality issues at times of favorable business conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggressive Investor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth Stock ‚Äì one which has increased their per share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common stocks and is generally expected to continue to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth stocks have 2 problems ‚Äì Growth stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell at correspondingly high prices. The investor maybe right in his judgement of the prospects and still not do well. Merely because he overpaid for the expected prosperity. The 2nd is his judgment as the future may prove wrong. Rapid growth can&amp;#39;t last forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from IPO&amp;#39;s/Common stock offerings. They tend to be offered in &amp;quot;favorable&amp;quot; market conditions for the sellers, not the buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The habit of the market is to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth, but it will also undervalue companies that are out of favor because unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If looking at growth companies, concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a period of unpopularity. Smaller companies don&amp;#39;t have the resources to withstand the storm and the market is slower to react to improvement vs larger companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 major sources of undervaluation. A. currently disappointing results and B. unpopularity. But make sure these are temporary and not permanent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The investor should require an indication of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past decade. No years of earnings deficit plus size and strength to meet possible setbacks. The ideal combination here is that of a large and prominent company selling both well below its past average price and its past average P/E ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondary Company ‚Äì one that is not a leader in a fairly important industry. They tend to be undervalued at all times. Buy them only when they are at &amp;quot;Bargain&amp;quot; prices. Bargain being a stock that has an indicated value 50% above the share price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways to profit from secondary buys. A. The dividends are relatively high. B. The reinvested earnings are high relative to price paid and will affect the price. C. A bull market is most generous to lower priced issues. D. Smaller companies may be acquired by larger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broadest category of investments for the enterprising investor are undervalued stocks of secondary issues. Invest in these only when they can be bought at 2/3 or less of indicated value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market Fluctuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 ways to profit from pendulum swings in the market A. Timing ‚Äì anticipate the direction of the market and buy/sell accordingly (Very Difficult to do). B. Pricing ‚Äì buying or selling when the stock are quoted above or below fair value. You may do dollar cost averaging when the market is fair value or undervalued to replicate this strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A less ambitious form of pricing is the simple effort that you do not pay too much for your stocks. This may work for the defensive investor who is planning on holding long term. You can dollar cost average during fair or low value markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bull Market Signs ‚Äì Historically high price levels, high P/E ratios, low dividend yields against bond yields, speculation on margin, lots of public offerings of low quality stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more successful a company, the more likely its price will fluctuate widely. Secondary issues will also fluctuate more widely than major ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell because it has gone down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The speculators primary interest lie in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor&amp;#39;s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at good prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy-Low Sell High ‚Äì very difficult to do, so instead increase the proportion of bonds in your portfolio during bull markets and reduce the common stock element. Say 75B/25S during bull markets and 25B/75S during bear and 50/50 during fair value. This allows the investor to feel as if they are doing something and to prevent you from following the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
