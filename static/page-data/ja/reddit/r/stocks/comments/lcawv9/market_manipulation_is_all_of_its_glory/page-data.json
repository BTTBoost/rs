No one individual gets to say I can&#39;t buy this stock at 233. Imagine not letting people buy Tesla because they say it is not worth 810 billion dollars as of today. When would a brokerage ever try and stop retail from losing money? They only stopped buying because there was risk of an infinite squeeze. This is not a reason to halt buying, they halted buying not just for those at risk of not being able to pay, they halted buying for EVERYONE. Anyone with one ounce of economics knows if you stop allowing buying you completely shift your supply and demand graph to the right cratering shares.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it. There is a BIGGER question here. Something very fishy is going on.</p>\n\n<p>Please share this as wide as possible. Brokerages have no right to tell us in a free market how much we can and cannot pay for a stock.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to Delivers Since 2010: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R4pSK-JAxMssip8QOBgCCpDfuizidvIx211riwjp7dY/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R4pSK-JAxMssip8QOBgCCpDfuizidvIx211riwjp7dY/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure: I own GME.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcawv9/market_manipulation_is_all_of_its_glory/","title":"Market Manipulation is all of it's Glory.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T15:42:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 15:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7beb97fd-6977-53aa-a435-d7e06671cd04","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcawv9/market_manipulation_is_all_of_its_glory/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcawv9/market_manipulation_is_all_of_its_glory/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Phil-OSOPHY","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Phil-OSOPHY","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Phil-OSOPHY","score":141,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"市场操纵是它所有的荣耀。","the_new_excerpt":"市场操纵（显然，你不能决定以什么价格买入。\n托马斯-彼得菲为你决定）。)\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/billionaire-peterffy-worried-integrity-markets-231949667.html\n\n没有一个人可以设定股票的价格，股票的价格是完全的。\n基于...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場操縱是它所有的榮耀。","the_new_excerpt":"市場操縱（顯然，你不能決定以什麼價格買入。\n托馬斯-彼得菲爲你決定）。)\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/billionaire-peterffy-worried-integrity-markets-231949667.html\n\n沒有一個人可以設定股票的價格，股票的價格是完全的。\n基於...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8dd4015f-8863-5308-ba33-5a5bde0f6b1c","excerpt":"https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf\n\nThe Finnish telecom network firm reported earnings per share of EUR 0.26 ($0.31)\nfor the full-year 2020 compared with EUR 0.22 ($0.26) for full-year 2019.\n\nFor Q4, EPS stood at EUR 0.14 ($ 0.17) compared with EUR 0.15 ($0.18) in…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lcgbyl/nok_q4_2020_earnings_eps_beaten_by_2967/","title":"NOK Q4 2020 earnings: EPS beaten by 29.67%","date":"February 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"诺克2020年第四季度财报。EPS超额完成29.67%。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf\n\n这家芬兰电信网络公司的每股收益为0.26欧元（0.31美元）。\n为2020年全年，而2019年全年为0.22欧元（0.26美元）。\n\n第四季度，每股收益为0.14欧元（0.17美元），相比之下，第四季度为0.15欧元（0.18美元），...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"諾克2020年第四季度財報。EPS超額完成29.67%。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf\n\n這家芬蘭電信網絡公司的每股收益爲0.26歐元（0.31美元）。\n爲2020年全年，而2019年全年爲0.22歐元（0.26美元）。\n\n第四季度，每股收益爲0.14歐元（0.17美元），相比之下，第四季度爲0.15歐元（0.18美元），...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a157add2-1fde-56ca-ae76-fc2f933586d5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc3b9i/in_case_there_was_any_doubt_look_at_how_much_the/","title":"In Case There Was Any Doubt.
