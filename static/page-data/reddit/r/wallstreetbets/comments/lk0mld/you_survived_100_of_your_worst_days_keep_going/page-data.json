I know I&#39;m just a stranger, but trust me okay? Everytime you look at your portfolio, I want you to give yourself a hug. Look—right now the market is absolutely nuts. Those of you out there who only just recently learned how to trade during the past 4 years <em>AKA 🍊 Era</em> haven&#39;t really experienced what it&#39;s like without ink 💸 in the well. Falling asleep to the sound of a billion angelic bRrRRrRrrrRRs whispering in your ears is a sweet treat, so you might be a bit worried when dady tells you he&#39;s going to the corner store for cigarettes. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>there is no reason for alarm</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does seeing that mixture of letters above frighten you? Fear not, young lads, because you can&#39;t read anyways. </p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve been so accustomed to life in the frog 🐸 market <em>(best market)</em> and hopping around from ticker to ticker that even seeing the words fundamentals and PE ratio make you immediately think of boomers and the cancer they&#39;re spreading on a daily basis. This wasn&#39;t always the case, surprisingly enough, but markets evolve just like the 🦧 into 💁‍♂️ and we are now living through a <strong>major, generational shift in markets</strong> once again. </p>\n\n<p>Despite evidence from a fuckton of people telling you that you&#39;re retarded, you&#39;re not really <em>that</em> artistically inclined. Sure, maybe a few 0dte&#39;s here and there, what&#39;s wrong with a bit of fun? Better than being a good little girl like chef buffet and wasting valuable capital on <em>hedging</em> which is akin to a nuclear level of retardation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>i m a g i n e </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wasting money on hedges when you can mortgage your house, sell your car, or find your wife a daddy, and go balls deep on 0dte options. We are living in the 21st century, <em>motherfuckers</em>, and we have the <em>luxury of being retarded</em>—something that doomers, gloomers, and boomers never could&#39;ve seen coming. <em>We&#39;re their Frankenstein</em> and now they&#39;re going to do whatever it takes to shock us away from it all. </p>\n\n<p>The storm is coming, but <em>we have time on our sides, they don&#39;t</em>—so steer clear of the Fear, Uncertainty, &amp; 101 Dalmatians they&#39;re sending our way. <em>we&#39;re not afraid of dogs, we are the dogs</em> <strong>bOrk boRk</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>who let the dogs out</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is what they&#39;ll be screaming in bed. <em>Splash, splish, splash</em>—the Boston Tea party has returned as the Boomer ReeeEeeEEEee party. Except this time, the queen Elton Jon fears the screeching youth smashing panes of interactive glass. <em>tap TaP tap TaP</em>  these are the sounds that will haunt their nightmares. 🌈 🐻s don&#39;t sleep <em>(they never have)</em> &amp; not being with the herd  🦍 just means you&#39;re an enemy of the herd. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>goodnight, sweet prince</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only thing certain in life is change. You can count on the fact your life will change for the better. Unless you habitually make bad choices (such as buying puts on tesla to feed a habit) or remain in a war torn region, your life will change.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re a diverse breed, many species, very inclusive, but we are not one. When a group of experts fails to embrace a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, they prove that they don&#39;t care for their customers or their communities. Markets, just like people, continue to thrive on innovation. In some way, great or small, every person here helps to advance a breed of retarded buffoons to extraordinary heights. </p>\n\n<p>tl;dr <em>stonks only go<sup>up,</sup> hedgies can destroy our portfolios but only we can destroy our will to adapt and overcome</em></p>\n\n<p>Edit 1:  <em><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect\">scientific evidence for said evolutionary behaviour</a> — we&#39;ve already won. the seeds have been sewn in the fabric of space and time. <strong>godspeed, my fellow players</strong></em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk0mld/you_survived_100_of_your_worst_days_keep_going/","title":"You survived 100% of your worst days.
