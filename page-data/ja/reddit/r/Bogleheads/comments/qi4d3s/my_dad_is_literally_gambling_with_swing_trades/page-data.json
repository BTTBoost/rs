He buys them super cheap and then ends up selling them when they increase. He&#39;s literally turned his 10k into 26k, he buys cheap and if it dips he holds no matter what and eventually when the price increases he sells for around 10 - 50% gains. I keep warning him that his strategy is risky and tried to show him a balance sheet of the stocks he&#39;s buying telling him they are speculative but he says it&#39;s all bullshit and literally thinks he is some kind of trade guru. I showed him videos about Warren Buffet and his buy and hold strategy but when he saw that Warren&#39;s average return is only around 10% he says he makes 10% in a few days and that Buffet is a moron and he&#39;s smarter then him.</p>\n\n<p>I started with around 20k and from buying and holding index funds and stocks like APPL which have good balance sheets and are actually profitable and I&#39;ve only made a around 2k as I held through ups and downs. My dad tells me that I&#39;m stupid and I can me making as much as him if I just bought his shit companies sold them when they go up and then buy them again when they go down. Dude literally thinks he&#39;s smarter then people who invest professionally and it&#39;s pissing me off because no matter what he keeps making money, and far more then me. He&#39;s been doing this consistently since March and in all honestly he needs an ego check and I&#39;ve kind of been secretly wishing his portfolio would crash. He&#39;s seen -20% on his picks. he doesn&#39;t sell them and a few weeks later he&#39;s up 40%.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m honestly questioning my own investing strategy, my dad who has no idea what a market cap is, is making more money then me. I&#39;m honestly considering just doing what he&#39;s doing cause fuck it. I want money.</p>\n\n<p>Could anyone help me reconsider? It&#39;s honestly all getting to my head and upsetting me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qi4d3s/my_dad_is_literally_gambling_with_swing_trades/","title":"My dad is literally gambling with swing trades and is consistently making money","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"October 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-29T06:30:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-29 06:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qi4d3s","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qi4d3s/my_dad_is_literally_gambling_with_swing_trades/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qi4d3s/my_dad_is_literally_gambling_with_swing_trades/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"Berryblex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Berryblex","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Berryblex","score":250,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の父はスイングトレードで文字通りギャンブルをしていて、安定して稼いでいます。","the_new_excerpt":"少し前に投資を始めて、インデックスファンドの基礎を学びました。\nインデックスファンド、バランスシート、長期的な購入と保有などの基本を学びました。私の父も投資を始めました。\n投資を始めたんだけど、彼は自分の貯金（約1万ドル）をすべてEVGOやLLKKFのようなリチウム・ペニーストックにつぎ込んでいるんだ。\nEVGOやLLKKFのようなリチウムのペニーストックなどに投資しています。彼はそれらを買っています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我爸爸简直是在用波段交易赌博，而且一直在赚钱","the_new_excerpt":"我不久前开始接触投资，我学习了关于指数基金的基本知识。\n资产负债表，购买和长期持有等等。我的父亲也开始\n但他把他所有的积蓄（大约1万美元）都投入到像EVGO和LLKKF这样的锂电细价股中。\n像EVGO和LLKKF这样的锂电细价股。他买下了它们...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我爸爸簡直是在用波段交易賭博，而且一直在賺錢","the_new_excerpt":"我不久前開始接觸投資，我學習了關於指數基金的基本知識。\n資產負債表，購買和長期持有等等。我的父親也開始\n但他把他所有的積蓄（大約1萬美元）都投入到像EVGO和LLKKF這樣的鋰電細價股中。\n像EVGO和LLKKF這樣的鋰電細價股。他買下了它們...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qhuawy","excerpt":"I am about to receive $10,000 and want to invest it in one of the companies\nbelow.
