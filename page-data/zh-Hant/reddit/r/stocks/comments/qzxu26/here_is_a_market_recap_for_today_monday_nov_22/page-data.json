Early in the morning, President Biden announced this morning that Jerome Powell was renominated to lead the Federal Reserve for another four years. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who was Powell’s main competitor, was nominated as the Vice-Chair. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for more inflation data set to be released later this week. </p>\n\n<p>On Monday, President Biden announced he was nominating Jerome Powell for a second, four-year term as the Chair of the Federal Reserve and Fed Governor Lael Brainard as the Vice-Chair, ending weeks of speculation who would be tapped to run the nation’s Central Bank. Biden was expected to select either Powell or current Fed Governor Lael Brainard as Fed chair. Following the nomination, Powell will go before the Senate Banking Committee for approval, and if confirmed, will serve another four-year term. </p>\n\n<p>Eric Browne, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Pimco, said “I think this was largely expected by markets. Certainly there were some conversations in markets over the last couple of weeks about Brainard potentially being elevated to the Fed chair position. But by and large the expectation was for consistency. You may see a little bit of a rally on the back of this with the expectation that policy is going to remain in place and intact, and everything that’s been articulated already by the Fed is likely to continue into 2022 and beyond.”</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, more inflation data is set to be released later this week, which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation and any potential reactions by the Federal Reserve. The Core Personal Consumptions Expenditure (PCE) , which is Fed’s preferred measure for inflation, is set to be released Wednesday and expected to show a 4.1% year-over-year increase. This would be the biggest annual jump in roughly three decades. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Constellation Brands (STZ), the maker of Corona beer, is reportedly exploring for a deal to merge with Monster Beverage, according to a report by Bloomberg</li>\n<li>Private Equity Firm KKR made a $12 billion bid to bring Telecom Italia private, sending shares of the Italian telecommunication company higher.</li>\n<li>Sales of previously owned homes in the US unexpectedly jumped to their highest level in nine months in October, signaling that housing demand is picking up against a backdrop of low mortgage rates and strengthening labor markets.

The program was developed by feeding 10 million high quality images into NVIDIA’s Selene supercomputer. This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist&#39;s vision into a high-quality AI-generated image. The practical benefi is that one can use a few words to get a basic image together without any drawing at all and then tweak details to refine the final output. </li>\n<li>In other news, NVIDIA is fast tracking development of its “<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/22/how-nvidia-aims-to-demystify-zero-trust-security/\">Zero-Trust” cybersecurity platform built using their data processing units and Morpheus AI</a>, citing vulnerabilities in it’s clients&#39; datacenters. Very basically, traditional cybersecurity relies on a perimeter or firewall that prevents viruses and hacks from getting into your computer. Zero-trust is an architecture that also constantly monitors all the data in the system and is able to enforce strict control on what each user can do on the network. Manuvir Das, Head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA said, “You cannot just rely on the firewall on the outside, you have to assume that any application or any user inside your data center is a bad actor,” and “It is not our intention to be a direct provider of cybersecurity solutions. We have built the platform for cybersecurity companies to integrate into their solutions.”</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qzxu26/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_monday_nov_22/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 22, 2021.
