It usually comes with the title <strong>How to 3x the S&amp;P CAGR with less risk | Leverage for the Long Run</strong> with people praising it as an amazing new strategy that requires little effort, provides a high degree of safety, and allows you to experience only the good side of leveraged ETFs. Here&#39;s why it&#39;s complete bullshit. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen the 200 SMA argument posted hundreds of times before in <a href=\"/r/LETFs\">r/LETFs</a>. I&#39;m glad this one at least comes with a paper, but the paper is still falling for the same mistakes other believers fall for. The author is correct that volatility increases below any significant moving average (20/50/100/200), however, avoiding volatility should not be your main concern when holding unhedged leveraged ETFs. Your main concern should be flash crashes like in 1987 where the market fell 22% in one day. The author says this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chart 6 shows that historically, the worst 1% of trading days have occurred far more often than not below the Moving Average. Included in this list are the two worst days in market history: October 19th in 1987 and October 28th in 1929</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow look at that, moving averages helped avoid the worst two days... but why? The answer is partially due to the fact that both the best and worst days will be in periods of high volatility, but it&#39;s also heavily influenced by pure chance. A day like Black Monday could happen at anytime and if there wasn&#39;t a choppy market leading up to it you will miss it with moving averages. An unleveraged 22% drop would be a 66% drop for the portfolio suggested in the paper. The market would then likely dip below the 200 SMA and the person would sell! Missing the entire ride back up, even if there was more to fall you&#39;re not going to be left in a good place. </p>\n\n<p>There is no macroeconomic reason that moving averages have any form of predictive power. The closest thing would be the concept of a self fulfilling prophecy which would require a massive audience of believers to have an impact (there are not nearly enough). People always use 200 SMA, but if you try to test other SMAs nearby you sometimes get significantly worse results. The 200 SMA just happens to get you out before the Dot Com crash as well as the GFC. When your entire reasoning is based on <em>well it did good in the past</em> you&#39;re overfitting by definition. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at another strategy that <strong>has</strong> an economic backing - HFEA. Holding stocks and bonds together isn&#39;t something that <em>just happens to work</em> when you test it. When stocks experience uncertainty large investors move their money into the safety of bonds which forces them in the opposite direction to the stock. Stocks and bonds are slightly, but not perfectly inversely correlated <strong>and</strong> both of them have positive expected returns. This is why they are the ideal hedge. </p>\n\n<p>I also want to point out that <strong>this is not an academic paper that came from a university</strong>. It was published by <a href=\"https://www.leadlagreport.com/\">https://www.leadlagreport.com/</a> which says on its homepage &quot;Consistently win in the stock market and minimize risk regardless of market conditions&quot; followed by a subscribe button. This is called bullshit and I encourage anyone who cares about honesty to call it out when shit like this is posted.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r03dsd/this_paper_has_been_going_around_investing/","title":"This paper has been going around investing subreddits and it is complete BS - here's why","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-23T13:05:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-23 13:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r03dsd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r03dsd/this_paper_has_been_going_around_investing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r03dsd/this_paper_has_been_going_around_investing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Market_Madness","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Market_Madness","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Market_Madness","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"この論文は、投資家のサブレッドで話題になっていますが、完全なBSです。","the_new_excerpt":"この論文を見たことがあるかもしれません\n(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701）を目にしたかもしれません。\nを見たことがあるかもしれません。この論文にはたいてい次のようなタイトルが付いています。\n少ないリスクでS&PのCAGRを3倍にする方法｜Leverage for the Long Run」というタイトルで出てきます。\n人々はこの論文を素晴らしい新技術だと称賛しています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"这篇论文一直在投资子网站上流传，它完全是胡说八道--原因如下","the_new_excerpt":"你可能已经看到了这份文件\n(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701)，在过去的一周里，漂浮在\n在过去的一周里，你可能已经看到了这份文件（），它漂浮在各种投资子论坛上。它通常带有以下标题\n标题是 \"如何以更小的风险获得3倍于标准普尔指数的年复合增长率\"，以及 \"长期的杠杆\"。\n人们称赞它是一个惊人的新方法。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這篇論文一直在投資子網站上流傳，它完全是胡說八道--原因如下","the_new_excerpt":"你可能已經看到了這份文件\n(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701)，在過去的一週裏，漂浮在\n在過去的一週裏，你可能已經看到了這份文件（），它漂浮在各種投資子論壇上。它通常帶有以下標題\n標題是 \"如何以更小的風險獲得3倍於標準普爾指數的年複合增長率\"，以及 \"長期的槓桿\"。\n人們稱讚它是一個驚人的新方法。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qzp0b7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzp0b7/heres_to_another_term/","title":"Here’s to another term","date":"November 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今期もよろしくお願いします。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"为另一个任期干杯","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲另一個任期乾杯","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-r00yce","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r00yce/the_gme_files_take_two/","title":"The GME Files.
