In fact, there have been no reports of hospitalisations or deaths as a result of anyone being diagnosed with Omicron. Most patients merely experience a severe headache, nausea, dizziness and a high pulse rate, according to hospitals and medics across Southern Africa.</p>\n\n<p>However, the news of the new variant, first reported in South Africa, led to mass hysteria around the world: markets thumbed and dozens of countries imposed travel restrictions and additional checks, including the UK, US, EU, Israel, Australia and Japan after the new mutation popped up in the UK, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic and Israel among other countries. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said this reaction was “medically seen, not justified.” A GP for over three decades, and chair of the South African Medical Association, she was the first African doctor to suggest to local authorities Covid had mutated into a new strain. Coetzee called the response from many European countries, including the UK, “just a hype.”</p>\n\n<p>South Africa’s health minister Joe Phaahla also said the majority of cases of Omicron seen by doctors in his country have been “mild”. He added he has heard from GPs that the “majority of the people they’ve been seeing are mild.” “Our clinicians have not witnessed severe illness. Part of it may be because the majority of those who are positive are young people,” Dr Paahla added.</p>\n\n<p>Full story here <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/covid-death-rate-not-rising-swap-travel-restrictions-and-mass-hysteria-for-cautious-optimism-as-omicron-mutation-is-super-mild-variant-who-and-coronavirus-experts-say/\">https://www.cityam.com/covid-death-rate-not-rising-swap-travel-restrictions-and-mass-hysteria-for-cautious-optimism-as-omicron-mutation-is-super-mild-variant-who-and-coronavirus-experts-say/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r4z16b/covid_death_rate_not_rising_swap_restrictions_and/","title":"Covid death rate not rising: Swap restrictions and mass hysteria for cautious optimism as Omicron mutation is ‘super mild‘ variant, WHO and","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-29T17:15:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-29 17:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r4z16b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r4z16b/covid_death_rate_not_rising_swap_restrictions_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r4z16b/covid_death_rate_not_rising_swap_restrictions_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rodriq04","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rodriq04","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rodriq04","score":159,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"コビットの死亡率は上昇していない。制限と集団ヒステリーを慎重な楽観主義に切り替えて、オミクロン変異は「超軽度」の変種であるとWHOと","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、突然の市場の低迷に不安を感じているなら、ここに\n嬉しいニュースがあります。\n\nWHOと世界中のコロナウイルス専門家が今朝、各国に呼びかけている。\n旅行制限をやめ、集団ヒステリーを終わらせ、代わりに慎重に楽観的になるよう各国に呼びかけています。\n慎重に楽観的になるよう呼びかけています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"科维德的死亡率没有上升。由于Omicron突变是 \"超级温和 \"的变种，世卫组织和将限制和大规模歇斯底里换成了谨慎的乐观态度。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们，如果你们对市场的突然下滑感到担忧，这里有一个好消息\n一些好消息\n\n世界卫生组织和世界各地的冠状病毒专家今天上午呼吁\n各国放弃旅行限制，结束大规模的歇斯底里，转而采取\n谨慎乐观的态度，因为最初的报告显示...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"科維德的死亡率沒有上升。由於Omicron突變是 \"超級溫和 \"的變種，世衛組織和將限制和大規模歇斯底里換成了謹慎的樂觀態度。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們，如果你們對市場的突然下滑感到擔憂，這裏有一個好消息\n一些好消息\n\n世界衛生組織和世界各地的冠狀病毒專家今天上午呼籲\n各國放棄旅行限制，結束大規模的歇斯底里，轉而採取\n謹慎樂觀的態度，因爲最初的報告顯示...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r4y3ma","excerpt":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jack-dorsey-stepping-down-twitter-ceo_n_61a4e36fe4b025be1aec6591\n\nTwitter investors seem to like this, but interesting that SQ is flat.
