Missing them would have triggered a default that could ripple through the Chinese economy: With some $300 billion in debt outstanding, the company’s inability to pay its debt would potentially hurt banks, property developers, and even home buyers in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the company has managed to leap from one deadline to the next, meeting its obligations at the last minute — but often without explaining how or even publicly disclosing that it had done so. The company has tried to sell off parts of its empire to raise enough cash.</p>\n\n<p>In October, when Evergrande said it had scrapped its effort to sell a $2.6 billion stake in its property services company to another developer, the company warned in a Hong Kong securities filing that there was “no guarantee” it would be able to meet its financial obligations or negotiate an extension with its creditors.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the company met its interest payment deadline for bonds that mature in 2022 and 2023, the company bondholder said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.</p>\n\n<p>The person did not specify if a payment on the third bond had also been made, but Bloomberg News reported that obligations for all three bonds were met, citing a spokesman for a clearing house.</p>\n\n<p>The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Although Evergrande has managed to avoid default so far, its troubles have already begun to weigh on other Chinese developers, with the government tightening controls on borrowing and investors retreating from the sector.</p>\n\n<p>At least six Chinese property developers have defaulted on foreign bonds in recent weeks, rattling domestic financial markets and raising the cost of borrowing for all Chinese companies. Property prices are slowing and fewer people are buying apartments, worsening the outlook for real estate.</p>\n\n<p>Evergrande’s challenges could spread outside of China as well, as they ripple through global financial markets. On Monday, the Federal Reserve said troubles in China’s property sector could threaten the United States.</p>\n\n<p>“Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through a deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States,” the Fed said in its twice-yearly update on the American financial system.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qr68n0/evergrande_meets_interest_payment_deadline_avoids/","title":"Evergrande meets interest payment deadline, avoids default","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T00:43:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 00:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qr68n0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qr68n0/evergrande_meets_interest_payment_deadline_avoids/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qr68n0/evergrande_meets_interest_payment_deadline_avoids/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"deevee12","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/deevee12","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"deevee12","score":537,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Evergrande社は金利支払い期限を守り、デフォルトを回避","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/business/evergrande-bond-deadline.html\n\n経営難に陥っている大手不動産会社の中国常緑樹は、水曜日に少なくとも2つの社債の利払いを行った。\n債券保有者によると、Evergrandeは水曜日に少なくとも2つの債券の利払いを行ったという。\nこれは、同社が再びデフォルトを回避したことを示すものである。\n\nEvergrandeは、投資家に対して...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"恒大满足付息期限，避免违约","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/business/evergrande-bond-deadline.html\n\n陷入困境的房地产巨头中国恒大，至少在两个项目上支付了利息。\n一位公司债券持有人表示，周三至少有两笔债券的利息支付，这表明它再次成功地避免了违约。\n这表明它又一次成功地避免了违约。\n\n恒大欠投资者的是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"恆大滿足付息期限，避免違約","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/business/evergrande-bond-deadline.html\n\n陷入困境的房地產巨頭中國恆大，至少在兩個項目上支付了利息。\n一位公司債券持有人表示，週三至少有兩筆債券的利息支付，這表明它再次成功地避免了違約。\n這表明它又一次成功地避免了違約。\n\n恆大欠投資者的是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qr4d2i","excerpt":"Disney reported earnings after the bell.
