It’s largest position is PLUG which I feel is risky as I’m not convinced hydrogen will become mainstream compared to EV’s (even though hydrogen has some advantages over EV in transportation). Furthermore, the majority of its holdings are in foreign companies and I’m not convinced Biden’s administration will lead to significantly more adoption of green energy on foreign soil. </p>\n\n<p>This ETF was trading in the $10 area for the last ten years until the v-shaped recovery started and then Biden was elected and it rocket shipped. I don’t get the argument of cheaper and more accessible green tech because green tech isn’t that much better off than it was a year ago when it was trading at $12. When I look at peoples reasoning for holding ICLN it’s almost always because either Biden was elected or because green tech is cheaper and more feasible now. While I think green sectors will see an increase in valuations, I just don’t see either of those reasons panning out for this specific ETF. Am I missing something else?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l11cw9/is_it_just_me_or_is_icln_not_convincing/","title":"Is it just me or is ICLN not convincing?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-20T11:56:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-20 11:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7398b63c-d76f-5e74-a909-5a70772edf98","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l11cw9/is_it_just_me_or_is_icln_not_convincing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l11cw9/is_it_just_me_or_is_icln_not_convincing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"UpgradeNotSure","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/UpgradeNotSure","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"UpgradeNotSure","score":83,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"是我的错觉还是ICLN没有说服力？","the_new_excerpt":"我对ICLN持怀疑态度。它最大的仓位是PLUG，我感觉是\n风险很大，因为我不相信氢气会比电动车成为主流。\n即使氢气在交通方面比电动车有一定优势）。\n此外，其持有的大部分股份都是外企，我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"是我的錯覺還是ICLN沒有說服力？","the_new_excerpt":"我對ICLN持懷疑態度。它最大的倉位是PLUG，我感覺是\n風險很大，因爲我不相信氫氣會比電動車成爲主流。\n即使氫氣在交通方面比電動車有一定優勢）。\n此外，其持有的大部分股份都是外企，我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e4a87321-57a0-5617-accf-de4b097a2c7e","excerpt":"From petition description:\n\n> Throughout the previous years Citron Research, a dedicated \"research\"\n> company, founded by Andrew Left, a questionable short seller, who has been\n> sued and convicted by regulators as well as governments, has been\n> publishing deliberate yet legal falsehoods made to…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0zl3z/petition_changeorg_petitioning_sec_finra_to/","title":"PETITION: Change.org petitioning SEC & FINRA to investigate Citron","date":"January 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"请愿：Change.org向美国证券交易委员会和金融业监管局请愿，要求调查雪铁龙。","the_new_excerpt":"来自请愿书描述。\n\n> 纵观前几年香橼研究，专门 \"研究\"\n>公司，由安德鲁-左创办，他是一个有问题的卖空者，他一直在\n> 被监管机构和政府起诉和定罪，已被起诉和定罪。\n> 发表故意而又合法的错误言论，以...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"請願：Change.org向美國證券交易委員會和金融業監管局請願，要求調查雪鐵龍。","the_new_excerpt":"來自請願書描述。\n\n> 縱觀前幾年香櫞研究，專門 \"研究\"\n>公司，由安德魯-左創辦，他是一個有問題的賣空者，他一直在\n> 被監管機構和政府起訴和定罪，已被起訴和定罪。\n> 發表故意而又合法的錯誤言論，以...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-25a698ef-762c-5f0f-a0e3-e82fbdff8fee","excerpt":"Why would the biden presidency be so good for ICLN?
