&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The House legislation would address both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it would prohibit any after-tax contributions in 401(k) and other workplace plans and IRAs from being converted to Roth savings. This rule would apply to all income levels starting after Dec. 31, 2021.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so this ends regular and mega backdoor for everyone, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Secondly, savers would be unable to convert pre-tax to Roth savings in IRAs and workplace retirement plans if their taxable income exceeds $400,000 (single individuals), $450,000 (married couples), or $425,000 (heads of household). It would start after Dec. 31, 2031.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this would be what people use do to the roth conversion ladder, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i&amp;#39;ve not found anything saying these were removed, just other things saying they are in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if these stick, will the logical choice just be after tax savings once you max your 401 and are over the roth ira limit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Shares of Zoom dipped Tuesday after the video-chat company warned investors of a revenue slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The report led Wall Street banks to slash price targets on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Zoom dipped more than 15% on Tuesday after the video-chat company warned investors of a revenue growth slowdown, leading some firms to cut price targets on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom was one of the pandemic darlings, going from a relatively niche business software segment to a household product. Millions of people used the company‚Äôs tech over the past nearly two years in order to keep up with school, work or socializing. But growth is slowing as people return to work and school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTIG, which lowered its price target to $400 from $460, reiterated its buy rating, but said the cut was to ‚Äúbetter reflect current market sentiment and group multiple compression.‚Äù Deutsche Bank Research also lowered its 12-month target to $280 from $350.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom opened at $218.05 on Tuesday and the stock is down more than 35% year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre positive on Zoom‚Äôs strategic initiatives and investments in key growth areas, we find it tougher to like a stock with more sharply decelerating growth and incremental pressure on profitability,‚Äù the researchers wrote in a Tuesday note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baird, Guggenheim, Wells Fargo, Stifel, UBS, Piper Sandler and KeyBanc also dropped their price targets. But Wall Street is generally still bullish on Zoom‚Äôs future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúModerating growth has been, and could continue to be a near-term stock headwind, though we remain positive on the long-term growth and platform opportunity particularly as the growth rate troughs over the next couple quarters,‚Äù Baird researchers wrote Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom‚Äôs revenue increased 35% from a year earlier in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, slowing from 54% growth in the quarter before. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Zoom forecast adjusted earnings of $1.06 to $1.07 per share on $1.051 billion to $1.053 billion in revenue, which implies 19% growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the 20 year bond is sitting around 2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if the federal reserve changes the base lending interest rate from 0-0.25% (which is what it is at now) to 0.25-0.50% (which is the most likely occurence we&amp;#39;re going to see monetary policy wise) within the next 12-18 months, what does that do to the 20 year treasury bond for example? does it go up 0.25bps?&lt;/p&gt;

I commented that they should post this here and they gave me permission to do so.  I have seen this paper referenced a number of times on this sub so I&amp;#39;m curious to hear peoples&amp;#39; thoughts on this rebuttal.  I have no personal bias one way or the other, just curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have seen this paper (&lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701&quot;&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701&lt;/a&gt;) floating around various investment subreddits over the past week. It usually comes with the title How to 3x the S&amp;amp;P CAGR with less risk | Leverage for the Long Run with people praising it as an amazing new strategy that requires little effort, provides a high degree of safety, and allows you to experience only the good side of leveraged ETFs. Here&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s complete bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen the 200 SMA argument posted hundreds of times before in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/LETFs&quot;&gt;r/LETFs&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m glad this one at least comes with a paper, but the paper is still falling for the same mistakes other believers fall for. The author is correct that volatility increases below any significant moving average (20/50/100/200), however, avoiding volatility should not be your main concern when holding unhedged leveraged ETFs. Your main concern should be flash crashes like in 1987 where the market fell 22% in one day. The author says this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chart 6 shows that historically, the worst 1% of trading days have occurred far more often than not below the Moving Average. Included in this list are the two worst days in market history: October 19th in 1987 and October 28th in 1929&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow look at that, moving averages helped avoid the worst two days... but why? The answer is partially due to the fact that both the best and worst days will be in periods of high volatility, but it&amp;#39;s also heavily influenced by pure chance. A day like Black Monday could happen at anytime and if there wasn&amp;#39;t a choppy market leading up to it you will miss it with moving averages. An unleveraged 22% drop would be a 66% drop for the portfolio suggested in the paper. The market would then likely dip below the 200 SMA and the person would sell! Missing the entire ride back up, even if there was more to fall you&amp;#39;re not going to be left in a good place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no macroeconomic reason that moving averages have any form of predictive power. The closest thing would be the concept of a self fulfilling prophecy which would require a massive audience of believers to have an impact (there are not nearly enough). People always use 200 SMA, but if you try to test other SMAs nearby you sometimes get significantly worse results. The 200 SMA just happens to get you out before the Dot Com crash as well as the GFC. When your entire reasoning is based on well it did good in the past you&amp;#39;re overfitting by definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at another strategy that has an economic backing - HFEA. Holding stocks and bonds together isn&amp;#39;t something that just happens to work when you test it. When stocks experience uncertainty large investors move their money into the safety of bonds which forces them in the opposite direction to the stock. Stocks and bonds are slightly, but not perfectly inversely correlated and both of them have positive expected returns. This is why they are the ideal hedge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that this is not an academic paper that came from a university. It was published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leadlagreport.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.leadlagreport.com/&lt;/a&gt; which says on its homepage &amp;quot;Consistently win in the stock market and minimize risk regardless of market conditions&amp;quot; followed by a subscribe button. This is called bullshit and I encourage anyone who cares about honesty to call it out when shit like this is posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the administration will tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as part of a global effort from energy-consuming nations to calm 2021‚Ä≤s rapid rise in fuel prices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The coordinated release between the U.S., India, China, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom is the first such move of its kind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In total, the U.S. will release &lt;strong&gt;50 million barrels&lt;/strong&gt; from the SPR. Of the total 32 million barrels will be an exchange over the next several months, while 18 million barrels will be an acceleration of a previously authorized sale.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;U.S. oil &lt;strong&gt;dipped 1.9%&lt;/strong&gt; to a session low of $75.30 per barrel following the announcement, before recovering some of those losses. The contract last traded 34 cents lower at $76.41. International benchmark Brent crude stood at $79.98 per barrel, for a gain of 34 cents.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/oil-prices-fall-on-bidens-decision-to-release-u-s-strategic-reserves-51637670056?mod=hp_LEAD_1&quot;&gt;Barron&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shares in big oil companies were also down, with both Shell (ticker: RDSA.London) and BP ( BP.London) falling 0.8%, TotalEnergies (TTE.France) up 0.2%.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shares of U.S. major oil companies were also sliding in pre-trading hours, with Exxon Mobil (XOM) declining by 0.3%. Chevron‚Äòs (CVX) stock price was stable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this oil reserve gambit going to slow down inflation enough to keep the growth stocks in the green? Or was yesterday&amp;#39;s drop just the beginning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brand new 3v3 MOBA game where teams take control of various Disney &amp;amp; Pixar characters behind developed by Mighty Bear Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be offered on Apple Arcade and goal is to keep it simple (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techradar.com/features/how-to-make-a-league-of-legends-kids-can-play-according-to-disney-melee-manias-developers&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOBA veterans may be aghast that Disney Melee Mania has no lanes, towers, computer-controlled minions, or even skill progression, but the result is the leanest version of the game type we‚Äôve ever seen ‚Äì which could be a perfect onramp for brand-new players to learn the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question isn&amp;#39;t so much specific to this game. My main question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think Disney will do a good job of expanding into gaming&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like Disney generally has been perhaps too cautious. Years ago they had chances to deepen their relationship with Riot Games, but they let that slip through their fingers. Now Riot has a hit on Netflix which could&amp;#39;ve been Disney&amp;#39;s. This is a big shame since Riot has an incredible universe of character and worlds that would be as good as a mini Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney has so much great IP if they can crack the gaming code, add that to their ESPN and merchandising expertise it will be huge.&lt;/p&gt;

Just because someone made 1000% gains on something doesn&amp;#39;t mean you are going to make that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, that the faster any asset climbs up the faster it comes down like a house of cards. If it had no resistance going up, there is no support going down and when such stocks crack, they fall through the roof in a matter of hours, not even days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, you get ads on YouTube every 2 seconds with someone shouting in your face with so called their magic formula where their students make $500-$2000 every trade. Don&amp;#39;t fall for these snake oil salesman. If making money were that easy, nobody would work their ass off for years just to buy a house or a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick up a book and learn the basics of Finance. Fundamentals will help you get a handle of how to start valuing a company. While Technical charts play a role in short to medium term movements of the stock, long term is always going to be based on Fundamentals. Watch Peter Lynch&amp;#39;s videos on YouTube, he is an old school investor just like Warren Buffett, but has some really good food for thoughts in his videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, if you are investing in Crpto be extremely conservative. 10% of your portfolio is too much. Anything more than that, and you lose your hard earned savings very quickly if things go south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand there is a Euphoria when you make quick money, but derivatives like Futures and Options are sure shot way of getting screwed if you don&amp;#39;t know what you are doing. Everyone has an itch to make a lot of money in a short period of time, but trust me, losing your original investment is one the worst feeling you can ever have if you earned that money by working hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know anything at all about investing and want to start putting some money into an investment account, buy a broad market based ETF like SPY or QQQ on a regular basis. Think $100-$200-$500/month. Time in the market is always going to beat timing the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, as Warren Buffett said - Rule 1: Never lose money and Rule 2: Never forget Rule 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Don&amp;#39;t invest blindly in Stocks that some friend/stranger recommended you. Efforts to make money quickly on Stocks, Crpto, or Derivatives (Futures and Options) without understanding the fundamentals and risks, will make you lose your hard earned money and your shirt. If you don&amp;#39;t know anything about investing, buy broad market based ETF like SPY and QQQ on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trading mostly even throughout the day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) sold off sharply in the last hour. Early in the morning, President Biden announced this morning that Jerome Powell was renominated to lead the Federal Reserve for another four years. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who was Powell‚Äôs main competitor, was nominated as the Vice-Chair. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for more inflation data set to be released later this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, President Biden announced he was nominating Jerome Powell for a second, four-year term as the Chair of the Federal Reserve and Fed Governor Lael Brainard as the Vice-Chair, ending weeks of speculation who would be tapped to run the nation‚Äôs Central Bank. Biden was expected to select either Powell or current Fed Governor Lael Brainard as Fed chair. Following the nomination, Powell will go before the Senate Banking Committee for approval, and if confirmed, will serve another four-year term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Browne, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Pimco, said ‚ÄúI think this was largely expected by markets. Certainly there were some conversations in markets over the last couple of weeks about Brainard potentially being elevated to the Fed chair position. But by and large the expectation was for consistency. You may see a little bit of a rally on the back of this with the expectation that policy is going to remain in place and intact, and everything that‚Äôs been articulated already by the Fed is likely to continue into 2022 and beyond.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, more inflation data is set to be released later this week, which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation and any potential reactions by the Federal Reserve. The Core Personal Consumptions Expenditure (PCE) , which is Fed‚Äôs preferred measure for inflation, is set to be released Wednesday and expected to show a 4.1% year-over-year increase. This would be the biggest annual jump in roughly three decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constellation Brands (STZ), the maker of Corona beer, is reportedly exploring for a deal to merge with Monster Beverage, according to a report by Bloomberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private Equity Firm KKR made a $12 billion bid to bring Telecom Italia private, sending shares of the Italian telecommunication company higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales of previously owned homes in the US unexpectedly jumped to their highest level in nine months in October, signaling that housing demand is picking up against a backdrop of low mortgage rates and strengthening labor markets. Existing home sales rose by 0.8% month-over-month in October, reaching an annualized rate of 6.34 million, according to data from the National Association of Realtors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors (GM) bought a 25% stake in electric boat startup Pure Watercraft for $150 million. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix (NFLX) said it is acquiring special effects company Scanline VFX, which is behind the effects of ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù and ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla Inc is planning to spend more than $1 billion on its new vehicle factory in Austin, Texas, and plans to complete construction by the end of this year, public filings with a Texas state agency showed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA (NVDA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-absurd-beauty-of-hacking-nvidias-gaugan-2-ai-image-machine/&quot;&gt;today detailed an AI system called GauGAN2,&lt;/a&gt; the successor to its GauGAN model, that lets users create lifelike landscape images that don‚Äôt exist using text. The program was developed by feeding 10 million high quality images into NVIDIA‚Äôs Selene supercomputer. This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist&amp;#39;s vision into a high-quality AI-generated image. The practical benefi is that one can use a few words to get a basic image together without any drawing at all and then tweak details to refine the final output. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other news, NVIDIA is fast tracking development of its ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/22/how-nvidia-aims-to-demystify-zero-trust-security/&quot;&gt;Zero-Trust‚Äù cybersecurity platform built using their data processing units and Morpheus AI&lt;/a&gt;, citing vulnerabilities in it‚Äôs clients&amp;#39; datacenters. Very basically, traditional cybersecurity relies on a perimeter or firewall that prevents viruses and hacks from getting into your computer. Zero-trust is an architecture that also constantly monitors all the data in the system and is able to enforce strict control on what each user can do on the network. Manuvir Das, Head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA said, ‚ÄúYou cannot just rely on the firewall on the outside, you have to assume that any application or any user inside your data center is a bad actor,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt is not our intention to be a direct provider of cybersecurity solutions. We have built the platform for cybersecurity companies to integrate into their solutions.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
