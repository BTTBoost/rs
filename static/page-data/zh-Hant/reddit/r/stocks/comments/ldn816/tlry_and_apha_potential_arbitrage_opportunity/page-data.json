The current price of APHA is lower than .83 of a TLRY share. Perhaps I&#39;m not understanding, but does this not mean that there&#39;s an obvious deal on APHA currently assuming the merger goes through? If the prices converge later, someone still would have been able to secure Tilray shares at a lower cost if they purchase now than simply buying Tilray shares. I&#39;m long on Tilray, and there of course risks (merger not going through, share price dropping significantly, etc.), but assuming these two stay the course and TLRY continues to rise isn&#39;t this a simple arbitrage opportunity? What am I missing?</p>\n\n<p>I additionally found an article which explains a way to limit downside (admittedly capping upside). Essentially the author suggests selling covered calls on APHA to maximize the arbitrage explained above. Would someone who is even more bullish be able to maximize returns even further by simply buying calls on Tilray currently for pre-merger?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any insight!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ldn816/tlry_and_apha_potential_arbitrage_opportunity/","title":"TLRY and APHA: Potential arbitrage opportunity?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T06:37:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 06:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"568da942-1d98-5639-b168-9c92e71c7cae","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldn816/tlry_and_apha_potential_arbitrage_opportunity/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldn816/tlry_and_apha_potential_arbitrage_opportunity/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"J_Asti","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/J_Asti","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"J_Asti","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"TLRY和APHA：潜在的套利机会？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我有个问题。\n\n大麻公司Tilray和Aphria计划合并，形成最大的。\n到第二季度末，按收入计算的全球大麻公司。\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tilray-stock-rockets-after-reverse-merger-deal-with-aphria-to-create-largest-global-cannabis-company...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"TLRY和APHA：潛在的套利機會？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我有個問題。\n\n大麻公司Tilray和Aphria計劃合併，形成最大的。\n到第二季度末，按收入計算的全球大麻公司。\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tilray-stock-rockets-after-reverse-merger-deal-with-aphria-to-create-largest-global-cannabis-company...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6eec707d-6adc-5525-abd1-db08ad528c02","excerpt":"Hello,\n\nI am new to investments and I am having a look at International Consolidated\nAirlines (IAG:MAD) which peaked 7,71€ precovid and now sits bellow 2€.\n\nKnowing these are big companies that will most likely back up once travel\nresumes, and goverments putting a lot of money to help such companies…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ld7y7m/airlines_stock_post_covid/","title":"Airlines stock post covid","date":"February 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"航空公司股票后covid","the_new_excerpt":"你好啊\n\n我是投资新手，我正在看国际综合公司的情况。\n航空公司(IAG:MAD)，其最高价为7.71欧元precovid，现在位于2欧元以下。\n\n知道这些都是大公司，将最有可能回升，一旦旅游\n简历，政府投入大量资金帮助这些公司... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"航空公司股票後covid","the_new_excerpt":"你好啊\n\n我是投資新手，我正在看國際綜合公司的情況。\n航空公司(IAG:MAD)，其最高價爲7.71歐元precovid，現在位於2歐元以下。\n\n知道這些都是大公司，將最有可能回升，一旦旅遊\n簡歷，政府投入大量資金幫助這些公司... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7ed15a00-58b6-5de8-95f8-55756cf300fc","excerpt":"Guys we need to stop posting loss porn on GME (FOR NOW) The Loss porn if half of\nit even real just kills moral.
