The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.</p>\n\n<p>But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8224d512-a76e-4d38-91c1-935ba119eb8f/page/GfZpB\">https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8224d512-a76e-4d38-91c1-935ba119eb8f/page/GfZpB</a></p>\n\n<p>If true, the government will have no choice but to call another state of emergency, it will considerably impede recovery prospects. I want to bet on this, but don’t know how to do it without potentially losing my shirt. is there a simple way I could do it using my account using simple financial products?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mgwrdt/might_be_a_good_time_to_short_the_japanese_stock/","title":"Might be a good time to short the Japanese stock market.
