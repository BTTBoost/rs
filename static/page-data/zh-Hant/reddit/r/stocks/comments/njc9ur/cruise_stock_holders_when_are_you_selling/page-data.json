Now it is up around 100% (mostly long term gains) and I recently reflected if my hypothesis for the stock was seen through.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly I did not expect to hold so long. I bought expecting a faster return to normal and if I knew in advance they wouldn&#39;t sail in the US until July 2021 I would assume it would be a bad investment. </p>\n\n<p>However, now they are confirmed to sail in July. I guess the hype that is left would be the cruises actually sailing successfully, and then the announcement of what they will do with their reserve cash ($11.5 billion compared to their usual $1 billion or less). They have around $26 billion in long-term debt (compared to $9 billion before the coronavirus) so I imagine it is a priority to pay off that. Then there are expenses of getting the cruises prepared to sail and upkeep. </p>\n\n<p>So even if CCL were to pay off $10 billion (maybe not the best use of funds) of their debt they would still be $6 billion more in debt than before the coronavirus with their dividend gone and shares heavily diluted.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, their market cap is practically the same as it was pre-covid. In December 2019 they had a run up but the market cap now is actually higher than it was in November 2019. It would require billions in stock buybacks for the share price to rise to it&#39;s pre-covid levels (which included a dividend), on top of the billions needed to pay for debt/upkeep. Not to mention CCL was actually in a downtrend from 2018 on, with the market cap going from $50 billion to $30 billion.</p>\n\n<p>So why would I hold now? Even if they have a successful year I&#39;m having trouble justifying why they would continue to grow and outpace the SPY. </p>\n\n<p>Any other cruise stock holders? I&#39;ve already started shifting money into a different investment that I have higher conviction will return healthy gains.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/njc9ur/cruise_stock_holders_when_are_you_selling/","title":"Cruise stock holders, when are you selling?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-24T03:01:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-24 03:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9d37b189-fd16-5a44-9a00-b3cbc82a7985","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/njc9ur/cruise_stock_holders_when_are_you_selling/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/njc9ur/cruise_stock_holders_when_are_you_selling/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"squiglesthesquirrel","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/squiglesthesquirrel","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"squiglesthesquirrel","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"クルーズの株を持っている人、いつ売るの？","the_new_excerpt":"去年の4月下旬からCCL/CUK（カーニバル社）を買って、100％のポートフォリオにしました。\nした。現在は約100％の上昇（ほとんどが長期的な利益）となっています。\n最近になって、この株に対する私の仮説が当たったかどうか振り返ってみました。\n\n率直に言って、これほど長く保有するとは思っていませんでした。もっと早いリターンを期待して買ったのに...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"邮轮公司的股票持有人，你们什么时候卖？","the_new_excerpt":"我从去年4月底开始买入CCL/CUK（嘉年华公司），并使其成为我投资组合的100%。\n我的投资组合中。现在它的涨幅约为100%（主要是长期收益），而我\n最近反映了我对该股的假设是否被看穿。\n\n坦率地说，我没有想到会持有这么久。我买入时期望有更快的回报......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"郵輪公司的股票持有人，你們什麼時候賣？","the_new_excerpt":"我從去年4月底開始買入CCL/CUK（嘉年華公司），並使其成爲我投資組合的100%。\n我的投資組合中。現在它的漲幅約爲100%（主要是長期收益），而我\n最近反映了我對該股的假設是否被看穿。\n\n坦率地說，我沒有想到會持有這麼久。我買入時期望有更快的回報......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-59e1ccfb-4fab-5986-abf3-84d82b1ffc49","excerpt":"I swear if I see one more “I invested in GME before my wife and her boyfriend\nleft me” story I am going to shoot myself.\n\nThis subreddit is for two things: tendies and gambling\n\nSometimes we gain them and sometimes we lose ‘em, but that’s what this place is.\nIf you want to cry about your life there…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njizhs/when_did_this_subreddit_become_therapy/","title":"When did this Subreddit become therapy?","date":"May 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"このSubredditはいつからセラピーになったの？","the_new_excerpt":"これ以上、「妻とその彼氏に捨てられる前にGMEに投資した」という話を見たら、自分を撃ち殺してしまいそうです。\nの話を見たら、私は自分を撃つつもりです。\n\nこのサブレディットは2つのことのためにあります：テンディとギャンブル\n\n得ることもあれば失うこともありますが、それがこの場所なのです。\nもしあなたがそこで自分の人生について泣きたいなら...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"这个Subreddit什么时候变成了治疗？","the_new_excerpt":"我发誓，如果我再看到一个 \"我在我妻子和她的男朋友离开我之前投资了GME\n抛弃我 \"的故事，我就会朝自己开枪。\n\n这个子版块是为两件事而设的，即：赌徒和赌博。\n\n有时我们得到它们，有时我们失去它们，但这就是这个地方的特点。\n如果你想在这里哭诉你的生活...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這個Subreddit什麼時候變成了治療？","the_new_excerpt":"我發誓，如果我再看到一個 \"我在我妻子和她的男朋友離開我之前投資了GME\n拋棄我 \"的故事，我就會朝自己開槍。\n\n這個子版塊是爲兩件事而設的，即：賭徒和賭博。\n\n有時我們得到它們，有時我們失去它們，但這就是這個地方的特點。\n如果你想在這裏哭訴你的生活...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a42eb676-84e6-5500-971d-238a52a000b1","excerpt":"Hello, so I was just chatting with my father about investing in stock and he\nthought about flights/airline stocks.
