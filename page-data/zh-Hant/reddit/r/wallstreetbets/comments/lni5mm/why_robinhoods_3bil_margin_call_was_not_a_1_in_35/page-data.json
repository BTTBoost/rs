Nor was it the largest by any measure. The volatility of equities being squeezed is common knowledge and expected. GME <strong>doubled</strong> in price the 2 weeks leading up to the squeeze, on astronomical short interest. We all knew it was squeezing, why didn&#39;t Robinhood?</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Yeah, but RH had so much more exposure than expected because so many retail buyers were buying it on their platform.&quot;</em> Well, duh. Why do you think stocks squeeze? Because of retail hype. And not only did Robinhood have the data to know and expect their user base to be in big on the squeeze, <strong>it&#39;s their freaking business model.</strong> They actively highlight popular stocks to attract new users and entice trading activity.</p>\n\n<p>So WTF was Robinhood expecting?
