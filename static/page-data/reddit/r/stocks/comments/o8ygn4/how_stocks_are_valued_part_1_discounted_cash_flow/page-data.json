But first, an important concept:</p>\n\n<h1>The Time Value of Money, Present Value, and Discount Rate</h1>\n\n<p><strong>A loan to a friend</strong></p>\n\n<p>Imagine if you loaned someone $1000 for a year. You probably want to be paid back with interest. This interest compensates you for losing access to that money for a year, during which you could have deposited it at a bank, invested it, or even spent it.</p>\n\n<p>The long story short is that $1000 today is worth more than $1000 tomorrow because of the flexibility and options that you have with today&#39;s money. We can say that the <strong><em>Present Value</em></strong> of $1000 next year is less than $1000 today. This concept is also known as <strong><em>The Time Value of Money.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>An Example With T-Bills</strong></p>\n\n<p>Treasury bills (T-Bills) are essentially loans to the US Government, but the amount to be repaid is fixed. T-Bills are typically denominated in $1000s, which is the amount the government will repay when the bond matures. </p>\n\n<p>An investor can typically buy a T-Bill for less than the full $1000 on the open market. The investor makes money because she purchased the future $1000 payment at a <strong><em>discount.</em></strong> This discount exists because money today is worth more than money tomorrow. How do you convert between the two? Using the appropriately named <strong><em>Discount Rate</em></strong>, or the required rate of return. </p>\n\n<p>The average investor wants to make money from lending money, even to the US Government. If investors want a 1% return, then $100 today is the same as $101 next year.</p>\n\n<p>We can similarly price T-Bills: If the required rate of return is 1%, and the bond will pay $1000 in a year, then the <strong><em>Present Value</em></strong> of the T-Bill is about $990. This is because the $990 investment will grow by 1% into $1000.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>--------------------------------------------------------</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Are you still awake? Good. This is the fun part.</p>\n\n<h1>So What Are Stocks Anyway?</h1>\n\n<p>Stocks represent partial ownership of a company. A company is divided into units of stock called shares, and as a shareholder, you are entitled to a fraction of the company&#39;s assets (after all debts are repaid) and any future profits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So Why Does a Stock Have Value?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Part of a stock&#39;s value comes from its book value (the value of all company assets minus all company debt) but this clearly only a small fraction of that price ( the average price-to-book ratio for the companies in the S&amp;P500 is about 4.5). <strong><em>The remainder of the stock value comes from the future earnings of a company.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Similar to how the price of a T-Bill is the present value of a future payment, a large part of a stock&#39;s value comes from the present value of future earnings. Analysts will project (and discount) a company&#39;s future earnings, add the book value, and arrive at an estimate of the stock&#39;s value.</p>\n\n<h1>Oversimplified DCF Example:</h1>\n\n<p>The Pear Company makes $100 a year risk-free. For simplicity&#39;s sake, it has $200 in assets and no debt. For some reason, you figure 100% is a good discount rate to use.</p>\n\n<p>The Pear Company will make $100 next year (Year 1), which is worth $50 today ($50 doubles into $100 in a year). In Year 2, The Pear Company&#39;s earnings are only worth $25 to you today, and so on. If you add the present value of all future cash flows together, you&#39;ll arrive at $100. </p>\n\n<p>You can find the company value by adding the value of its assets ($200) with the present value of its future earnings ($100).  If Pear issues 100 shares, each will be worth $3.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/DzMQHHT\">Of course, even simple DCF Models IRL look a little scarier than the above example.</a></p>\n\n<h1>But What Makes The Stock Valuable To Me?</h1>\n\n<p>You might have noticed that dividends aren&#39;t really taken into account at all. How are you supposed to get any real money from a company whose stock pays no dividends?</p>\n\n<p>Unpaid dividends don&#39;t just disappear. Management can decide to reinvest these profits to grow their income. This results in a larger stock price over time. The company might also just decide to keep the cash on its balance sheet. This results in a larger book value, and the stock price will increase to reflect that.</p>\n\n<p>You can sell some stock to create your own &quot;dividend&quot; if you&#39;d like; you will own a smaller percentage of the company, but because profits were not distributed to shareholders, the company has gotten bigger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But What Makes The Stock Valuable To The Next Guy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Eventually, the company&#39;s value will be returned to shareholders. This could happen in several ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Dividends are paid out in the future, returning capital to investors</li>\n<li>The company is acquired or goes private, and shareholders either receive cash or stock in the acquiring company. Typically, the acquisition price is determined by, among other things, the present value of all future earnings of the company,</li>\n<li>The company might also just decide to stop operating and liquidate its assets. Shareholders will receive all assets the company owns (after paying its debt).</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/","title":"How Stocks Are Valued Part 1: Discounted Cash Flow","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-27T17:04:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-27 17:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a14400d8-1615-56a0-9015-f8ffc131f4e7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ArchegosRiskManager","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ArchegosRiskManager","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ArchegosRiskManager","score":231,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"株式の価値はどのようにして決まるのか、その1。ディスカウント・キャッシュ・フロー","the_new_excerpt":"昨日、このサブサイトで「なぜ株は価値があるのか」という質問を見かけたので\n私がビジネススクールで学んだ株についての内容を書いてみようと思いました。\nその前に、重要な概念があります。\n\n\n貨幣の時間的価値、現在価値、割引率\n\n友人への貸し付け\n\nもしあなたが誰かにお金を貸すとしたら...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"股票是如何估值的第一部分。贴现现金流","the_new_excerpt":"我昨天在这个子网站上看到了一个关于股票为什么有价值的问题，所以我\n我想我应该把我在商学院学到的关于股票的知识写出来。\n但首先，一个重要的概念。\n\n\n货币的时间价值、现值和贴现率\n\n贷款给一个朋友\n\n想象一下，如果你借给别人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"股票是如何估值的第一部分。貼現現金流","the_new_excerpt":"我昨天在這個子網站上看到了一個關於股票爲什麼有價值的問題，所以我\n我想我應該把我在商學院學到的關於股票的知識寫出來。\n但首先，一個重要的概念。\n\n\n貨幣的時間價值、現值和貼現率\n\n貸款給一個朋友\n\n想象一下，如果你借給別人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-421b9ec0-19ac-5e8f-8a28-c7bf54ff4b0b","excerpt":"Imagine you have $150K sitting in the bank not collecting any income.
