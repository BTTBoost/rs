It seems to be a general sentiment about the market as a whole, that we must buy the dip and hold through it. This is a good strategy for your long positions that you are planning on holding for 10+ years, but most people have at least a few positions that are not long-term &#39;ride-or-die&#39; equities. And yes, there are times when it&#39;s fine to sell the dip as well.</p>\n\n<p>The prevailing argument is that, if only everyone would stop selling, the market wouldn&#39;t crash. But this is the prisoner&#39;s dilemma. The fact is, people will sell. No matter how bonded you feel to your cohorts on Reddit, they will turn against you and sell as soon as they see enough commas in their portfolio. (Or enough blood)</p>\n\n<p>If you are holding shares of some company, and you believe the price of those shares will continue to drop, then what&#39;s stopping you from selling? Is it fear that you&#39;ll sell at the absolute bottom and miss out on gains? Isn&#39;t it just as possible that you&#39;ll sell right before an even bigger dip, and be able to buy back in at an even lower cost basis? Both choices are worth considering. It is not rational to simply dismiss the option of selling as inherently bad.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: It&#39;s OK to buy high and sell higher. It&#39;s also OK to sell low and buy lower. Stop trying to get the perfect timing, because you never will. If you&#39;re watching your net worth drop to unrecoverable levels, it&#39;s time to sell. Don&#39;t fall in love with your positions. It&#39;s a lonely hill to die on.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I&#39;m not a financial advisor, but if you&#39;re looking to rotate into less risky investments as a hedge, I would recommend learning about SPACs. Most of them are trading at their rock bottom right now, which means you are pretty much guaranteed not to lose money if you know what you&#39;re doing. Used correctly, they can be like savings accounts with infinite upside potential. Selling at a loss can suck, but it sucks less when you&#39;re putting that money it to something that won&#39;t make you poor and might still make you rich. Just my two cents.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mdcpjo/psa_its_okay_to_sell_at_a_loss/","title":"PSA: It's okay to sell at a loss","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-26T04:52:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-26 04:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"facec458-a964-5274-bc6e-d2fab7141447","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdcpjo/psa_its_okay_to_sell_at_a_loss/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdcpjo/psa_its_okay_to_sell_at_a_loss/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Kronodeus","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kronodeus","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Kronodeus","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"PSA：亏损卖出也无妨","the_new_excerpt":"最近有很多 \"钻石手 \"的心态出来，不仅仅是\n与备忘录股。似乎是对市场的一种普遍情绪，作为一个\n整体，即我们必须买入跌停板，并通过它持有。这是一个很好的策略\n你的多头头寸，你打算持有10+... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PSA：虧損賣出也無妨","the_new_excerpt":"最近有很多 \"鑽石手 \"的心態出來，不僅僅是\n與備忘錄股。似乎是對市場的一種普遍情緒，作爲一個\n整體，即我們必須買入跌停板，並通過它持有。這是一個很好的策略\n你的多頭頭寸，你打算持有10+... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bdd168b9-caba-54d5-b8d3-acc978a7b397","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdahdr/gme_yolo_if_im_still_in_then_im_still_in_btfd/","title":"$GME YOLO - If I'm still in, then I'm still in.
