The ban includes top policymakers such as those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, along with senior staff. Future investments will have to be confined to diversified assets such as mutual funds. Fed officials can no longer have holdings in shares of particular companies, nor can they invest in individual bonds, hold agency securities or derivative contracts. The new rules replace existing regulations that, while somewhat restrictive, still allowed members to buy and sell stocks. “These tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single-minded focus on the public mission of the Federal Reserve,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement. Under the new rules, the officials will have to provide 45 days’ notice in advance of buying or selling any securities that are still allowed. They also will be required to hold the securities for at least a year, and cannot buy or sell funds during “heightened financial market stress,” a news release announcing the moves said.</p>\n\n<p>The rules come on the heels of disclosures that multiple Fed officials had been buying and selling stocks at a time when the central bank’s policies were designed to improve market functioning, particularly during the Covid crisis. Regional presidents Robert Kaplan of Dallas and Eric Rosengren of Boston both resigned shortly after disclosures that they had engaged in trading of individual securities last year. In Kaplan’s case, the moves occurred in large-dollar allotments. Vice Chairman Richard Clarida also had been featured in the reports. Powell also sold securities last year, though they were exchange-traded funds that tracked market indexes.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qcxqn0/fed_to_ban_policymakers_from_owning_individual/","title":"Fed to ban policymakers from owning individual stocks, restrict trading following controversy","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-21T19:22:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-21 19:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qcxqn0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qcxqn0/fed_to_ban_policymakers_from_owning_individual/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qcxqn0/fed_to_ban_policymakers_from_owning_individual/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"WickedSensitiveCrew","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WickedSensitiveCrew","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"WickedSensitiveCrew","score":10033,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FRBが政策担当者の個別株保有を禁止し、取引を制限することが話題に","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/fed-to-ban-policymakers-from-owning-individual-stocks-restrict-trading-following-controversy.html\n\n米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は12日、投資慣行をめぐる論争の高まりを受けて\nFRB（連邦準備制度理事会）は木曜日、職員が個別の株式を所有することを禁止し、その他の...\nまた、その他の株式についても制限を設けました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美联储禁止政策制定者拥有个人股票，在争议后限制交易","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/fed-to-ban-policymakers-from-owning-individual-stocks-restrict-trading-following-controversy.html\n\n针对有关投资行为的越来越多的争议，美联储在周四的会议上回应了这一问题。\n周四，美联储宣布禁止官员拥有个人股票，并限制其他投资。\n限制其他投资。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美聯儲禁止政策制定者擁有個人股票，在爭議後限制交易","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/fed-to-ban-policymakers-from-owning-individual-stocks-restrict-trading-following-controversy.html\n\n針對有關投資行爲的越來越多的爭議，美聯儲在週四的會議上回應了這一問題。\n週四，美聯儲宣佈禁止官員擁有個人股票，並限制其他投資。\n限制其他投資。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qcszp3","excerpt":"I had own paypal since the stock was $50 a share, i see it as a long term play\nwith solid financials but this recent deal strikes me as a bad move and they\nshould had bought etsy instead.
