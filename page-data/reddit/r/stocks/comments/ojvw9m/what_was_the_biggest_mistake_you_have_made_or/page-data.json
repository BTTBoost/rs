(late 1994) I have seen so many things happen in my time of trading. The Dot Com Crash of 2000, the financial meltdown due to mortgages in 2008 and the 2 month correction in 2020 caused by Covid 19. Many traders, especially retail, and on Reddit are probably new and came in after May of 2020. Some have come with Meme craze in late January, so it is important to hear the stories from others so that we can try and gather a perspective if what we have done was bad, or were more worse horror stories.</p>\n\n<p>From 1995 until late 1999 the market was absolutely amazing! In 1996-1997 I finally got internet, dial up AOL 4.0! At that time it made trading and investing much easier. Before that time I would write in a daily journal closing and opening prices for 2-3,000 stocks, daily!!!! Computers were 3-5,000 back then for a very good one and I was a kid! The Dial up US robotics 56K modem was $300.</p>\n\n<p>This last paragraph was very important because with the internet and checking www dot com sites we all thought it was revolutionary. My biggest mistake, also humbled me and taught me many valuable lessons. Pre 1997-1998 I was calling my broker over the phone and paying $50 per trade. I was trading mainly blue chip stocks, on the DOW and SP....... As I came alone and did research....I started to do what we all did in 98-2000. Instead of looking at fundamentals, even sales!!! We started buying stocks based on the clicks of the website!! Yes, that is right! Insane, but right! Sites like Etoys where I lost $50,000 would publish daily or weekly clicks. Based on the clicks the stocks would take fire.... </p>\n\n<p>In the year 2000, the Nasdaq which was about 5,000 stocks as an index dropped 83% off the peak....I lost over 75% of my money... It was very humbling for myself. It taught me many lessons.</p>\n\n<p>You should buy in increments, blocks if you decide to buy the same stock. (I had 1,000 shares of PCLN at 85 and sold at 9 [loss of 76,000] PCLN dropped to 1.50.... It is now BKNG and 2,200] that is another story!</p>\n\n<p>Diversify! I thought I diversified by buying a ton of tech all in similar fields and sectors. It was a complete dot com bust!</p>\n\n<p>Fundamentals! Do not buy a company with no sales!! No earnings! Negative cash flow! They are going to take on new debt or sell you shares to raise cash!</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, no matter who we are, or how great we were, a crash can happen to anyone! From 1995-2000 I was taking unbelievable and insane risks. My gains were absolutely epic, then I lost 75% off the highs from I believe March - May 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Please share or thoughts so we can all engage. Also, so that new traders see this is not so bad at the moment!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ojvw9m/what_was_the_biggest_mistake_you_have_made_or/","title":"What was the biggest mistake you have made or which crash effected you the most?
