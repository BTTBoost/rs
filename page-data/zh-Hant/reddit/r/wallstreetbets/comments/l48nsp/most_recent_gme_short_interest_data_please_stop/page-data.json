I know you&#39;re trying to help other people out but that is DETREMENTAL because we can not have people believing that short interest hasn&#39;t changed when we DONT KNOW.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve commented on it several times already but I now feel the need to make this post because its seriously everywhere. </p>\n\n<p>To keep things short, SHORT INTEREST IS NOT AT 71.2M, THAT DATA IS THE EXCHANGE REPORTED SHORT INTEREST AND IT HASNT BEEN UPDATED SINCE FUCKIN DECEMBER 31st, STOP POSTING IT.</p>\n\n<p>I see this shit literally everywhere so now im gunna teach you guys how to read fuckin ortex screencaps so you stop spreading this shit</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/y9DpA2W\">Here is a screencap from the most recent ortex data</a></p>\n\n<p>FIRST look at the top left where it says &quot;Exchange Reported Short Interest&quot;, see that number under last? OFTLY FAMILIAR RIGHT? It says 71.2M and its from fuckin December 31st. Look at the list on the right hand side, the first row it says the settlement date is december 31st. If you look on yahoo finance, bloomberg, merrill or any other fucking financial site thats all theyre reporting. IF YOU SEE THAT SHORT INTEREST IS POSTED SOMEWHERE AND SAYS 71.2M ITS OUTDATED, JUST IGNORE IT.</p>\n\n<p>SECOND when people are posting Ortex data theyre using Ortex&#39;s ESTIMATED SHORT INTEREST. Its estimated but typically shown to be somewhat accurate. Look at the blue line on the chart, thats EXCHANGE REPORTED see how it stops at dec 31st? Now look at the purple line thats ORTEX ESTIMATED and you can see that it stops on jan 21st. It shows that estimated short interest is at 70.4M shares but that WE DONT HAVE FRIDAYS DATA YET. <strong>(Edit: I’ve been shown S3 data that estimates SI to be 71.85M as of Friday)</strong></p>\n\n<p>IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT YOU DONT RUN AROUND TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE SHORT INTEREST DATA IS 71.2M BECAUSE THAT NUMBER HASNT CHANGED FOR WEEKS AND ITS BEYOND OUTDATED, SHORT INTEREST CAN CHANGE SIGNFICANTLY IN A DAY</p>\n\n<p>Please help me out here by not spreading misinformation yourselves and by notifying people when they accidently post 3 week old data</p>\n\n<p>If you actually are curious what short interest is at THIS IS ALL WE KNOW RIGHT NOW: As of 1/21/21 SI is at 70.4M <strong>(S3 estimate gives Friday data showing 71.85M)</strong> we have no idea how much short interest changed on friday. All we can do right now is speculate, the last time the price skyrocketed short interest did as well, that may not be the case this time unless im underestimating the stupidity of retail bears, however, last time we saw a huge price surge SI actually went up bigly so who knows.</p>\n\n<p>The bloomberg terminal screencap is outdated, anything with 71.2M SI is outdated, please if you are going to spread SI data please make sure it is accurate first. Accurately tracking short sellers moves relies on SI data and as fun as it is to pretend that retard shorts havent covered at all in 3 weeks it is misinforming people and could end of fucking GME investors who miscalculated the trajectory of the shorts.</p>\n\n<p>If you have verifiably accurate SI data for the 22nd please comment it and I will edit this post so people can see, however, im almost certain at this point that we will not know until monday morning. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry for my rant, GME to the moon, Im not a financial advisor, I own GME shares, I am retarded.</p>\n\n<p>Obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR Edit: I want to add because some people are unsure what to think about this and some are interpreting it negatively. This is a neutral statement.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I guess I’ll also add this cuz people keep coming at me saying that ortex and S3 estimate data is good and that I’m wrong, I guess I wasn’t clear in my post originally but I agree that estimate data is good, I want daily estimate data posted, I don’t want 3 week old exchange data posted</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What I’m saying is we don’t have SI data for Friday, only Thursday (70.4M). If SI went up 10 million shares on Friday that would be interesting because it would make the squeeze more violent. If SI went down 10 million shares on Friday that would be interesting because it means the squeeze has begun. It’s a neutral statement, my argument is that accurate information is beneficial and inaccurate information is detrimental.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Not knowing stuff bad, knowing stuff good</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: S3 data says estimated SI was 71.85M on Friday, shout-out <a href=\"/u/Hypo_E\">/u/Hypo_E</a>        <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/LVnfka1\">https://imgur.com/a/LVnfka1</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>Alright Edit 3: if you read anything in this post it should be this, shoutout <a href=\"/u/0_to_1\">/u/0_to_1</a></strong></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>“Professional Analyst here - saw the post and dug in a bit.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Trading Volume Data sourced from Quandl, Short Interest Data sourced from ShortSqueeze.com.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m coming up with:</strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/w4NEQb0\">https://imgur.com/a/w4NEQb0</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>For the short open interest, that&#39;s reported by the exchanges.

It is just literally indicating that the 55M float from before probably actually just squeezed wayyyyy down to something in the 20M range. Which has a huge multiplier effect on the price action.
