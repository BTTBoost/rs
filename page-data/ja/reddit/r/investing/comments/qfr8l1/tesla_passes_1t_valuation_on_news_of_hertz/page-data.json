But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz&#39;s decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we&#39;ve only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,&quot; Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).</p>\n\n<p>Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more</p>\n\n<p>Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more</p>\n\n<p>However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board&#39;s new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its &quot;Full Self Driving&quot; software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB&#39;s questions about the automated driving system&#39;s safety.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,&quot; Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. &quot;Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford&#39;s Model T.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla&#39;s near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,&quot; Kirkhorn said.</p>\n\n<p>Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG&#39;s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China&#39;s Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.</p>\n\n<p>Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.</p>\n\n<p>The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz&#39;s rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,&quot; interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Tesla&#39;s cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.</p>\n\n<p>Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.</p>\n\n<p>With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qfr8l1/tesla_passes_1t_valuation_on_news_of_hertz/","title":"Tesla passes $1T valuation on news of Hertz ordering 100,000 cars.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-25T23:00:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-25 23:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qfr8l1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qfr8l1/tesla_passes_1t_valuation_on_news_of_hertz/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qfr8l1/tesla_passes_1t_valuation_on_news_of_hertz/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"cookingboy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cookingboy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cookingboy","score":2413,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テスラ、Hertz社が10万台発注のニュースで評価額1Tドルを突破。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hertz-orders-100000-tesla-cars-bloomberg-news-2021-10-25/\n\n> 10月25日（ロイター） - テスラ社（TSLA.O）の市場価値が1兆ドルを突破しました。\n> レンタカー会社のハーツから過去最大の受注を獲得したことで、市場価値が1兆ドルを突破しました。\n> その結果、市場価値は1兆ドルを超えた。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"特斯拉因赫兹订购10万辆汽车的消息而突破1亿美元的估值。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hertz-orders-100000-tesla-cars-bloomberg-news-2021-10-25/\n\n> 10月25日（路透社）--特斯拉公司（TSLA.O）的市值在周一突破了1万亿美元。\n> 在从租车公司赫兹(Hertz)获得有史以来最大的订单后，周一的市值突破了1万亿美元。\n> 这笔交易增强了特斯拉的竞争力。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉因赫茲訂購10萬輛汽車的消息而突破1億美元的估值。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hertz-orders-100000-tesla-cars-bloomberg-news-2021-10-25/\n\n> 10月25日（路透社）--特斯拉公司（TSLA.O）的市值在週一突破了1萬億美元。\n> 在從租車公司赫茲(Hertz)獲得有史以來最大的訂單後，週一的市值突破了1萬億美元。\n> 這筆交易增強了特斯拉的競爭力。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qfp6rv","excerpt":"Earnings: $3.22 vs $3.19 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue: $29.01 billion vs $29.57 billion expected by analysts, according to\nRefinitiv.\n\nDaily active users (DAUs): 1.93 billion vs. 1.93 billion expected by analysts,\naccording to StreetAccount.\n\nMonthly active users…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qfp6rv/facebook_beats_eps_but_misses_revenue_user/","title":"Facebook beats EPS, but misses revenue, user estimates and guidance for Q3","date":"October 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Facebook、EPSは上回るが、収入、ユーザー数の予想とガイダンスを下回る","the_new_excerpt":"収益：3.22ドル（アナリスト予想：3.19ドル）（Refinitiv社調べ\n\n売上高：290億1,000万ドル（アナリスト予想295億7,000万ドル）、とのことです。\nRefinitiv社調べ。\n\nデイリー・アクティブ・ユーザー（DAU）：19.3億人 vs アナリスト予想19.3億人。\nStreetAccount社調べ。\n\n月間アクティブユーザー数...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"脸书第三季度每股收益优于预期，但收入、用户预期和指引均不及预期","the_new_excerpt":"收益：3.22美元，而分析师预期为每股3.19美元，根据Refinitiv的数据。\n\n收入：290.1亿美元，分析师预计295.7亿美元，根据\nRefinitiv。\n\n每日活跃用户（DAUs）：19.3亿，分析师预期19.3亿。\n根据StreetAccount的数据。\n\n月度活跃用户（DAU）：19.3亿，分析师预期19.3亿。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"臉書第三季度每股收益優於預期，但收入、用戶預期和指引均不及預期","the_new_excerpt":"收益：3.22美元，而分析師預期爲每股3.19美元，根據Refinitiv的數據。\n\n收入：290.1億美元，分析師預計295.7億美元，根據\nRefinitiv。\n\n每日活躍用戶（DAUs）：19.3億，分析師預期19.3億。\n根據StreetAccount的數據。\n\n月度活躍用戶（DAU）：19.3億，分析師預期19.3億。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qfos56","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qfos56/tsla_today/","title":"$TSLA today 👀","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 25, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今日の$TSLA 👀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"$TSLA今天 👀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"$TSLA今天 👀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qfr8l1","previousId":"RedditPost-qfp6rv","nextId":"RedditPost-qfos56","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qfr8l1/tesla_passes_1t_valuation_on_news_of_hertz/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
