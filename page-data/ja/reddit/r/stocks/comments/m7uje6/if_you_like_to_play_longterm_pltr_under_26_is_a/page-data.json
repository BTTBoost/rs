I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of bearish cases for PLTR, but looking historically, the price tends to float between 24 and 26 when it&#39;s doing nothing, and could probably hit 30 on a good day, but if you want to stock up on shares, and there&#39;s no news, you should try to buy your shares between this range. If you get in under 24, you&#39;re doing very well, but even between this range, you&#39;ll be profitable in the future. Of course, this advice is only good if PLTR doesn&#39;t come out with a brilliant earnings report, a new project that will solve world hunger, or find a cure for cancer, but in general, this is the best entry range to ensure you don&#39;t miss out on any upward momentum, while saving yourself from any major losses.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7uje6/if_you_like_to_play_longterm_pltr_under_26_is_a/","title":"If you like to play long-term, PLTR under 26 is a good steal","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T17:50:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 17:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c7c99326-49df-5c4c-a675-e389db76eaf6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7uje6/if_you_like_to_play_longterm_pltr_under_26_is_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7uje6/if_you_like_to_play_longterm_pltr_under_26_is_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"RowanHarley","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RowanHarley","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"RowanHarley","score":186,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"如果你喜欢长期玩，26岁以下的PLTR是个不错的抢手货。","the_new_excerpt":"我不太清楚PLTRs的短期前景是什么，它们是综合的。\n与AWS的合作，我认为这将对他们的长久发展非常有利，同时也是\n其项目提供给反恐分析师、对冲基金、银行。\n金融公司。我相信PLTR有很多看空的案例，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你喜歡長期玩，26歲以下的PLTR是個不錯的搶手貨。","the_new_excerpt":"我不太清楚PLTRs的短期前景是什麼，它們是綜合的。\n與AWS的合作，我認爲這將對他們的長久發展非常有利，同時也是\n其項目提供給反恐分析師、對沖基金、銀行。\n金融公司。我相信PLTR有很多看空的案例，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bad83fe9-727a-5f3b-a0e6-5d63622b451e","excerpt":"I bought NVDA today, adding to a position I’d initiated in 2018 and have\ncontinuously added to on most dips.\n\nThe Bull Case\n\n * A great long term investment as demand for GPU’s will remain high for the\n   next decade\n * User markets such as data center, gaming and auto continue to grow\n * Leader in…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7qyyy/nvidia_nvda_is_a_great_long_term_investment/","title":"NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investment","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"英伟达--$NVDA是一项伟大的长期投资。","the_new_excerpt":"我今天买入了NVDA，追加了我在2018年启动的仓位，并已\n在大多数跌幅上不断加。\n\n牛市案例\n\n * 由于未来对GPU的需求将持续高涨，因此是一项很好的长期投资。\n   下一个十年\n * 数据中心、游戏和汽车等用户市场持续增长。\n *领导在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"英偉達--$NVDA是一項偉大的長期投資。","the_new_excerpt":"我今天買入了NVDA，追加了我在2018年啓動的倉位，並已\n在大多數跌幅上不斷加。\n\n牛市案例\n\n * 由於未來對GPU的需求將持續高漲，因此是一項很好的長期投資。\n   下一個十年\n * 數據中心、遊戲和汽車等用戶市場持續增長。\n *領導在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7f3e998c-6229-5cca-a90c-e180d9af4f20","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7ntcd/im_using_diamond_hands/","title":"I'm using Diamond Hands💎🙌","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我正在使用钻石手💎🙌。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我正在使用鑽石手💎🙌。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-c7c99326-49df-5c4c-a675-e389db76eaf6","previousId":"RedditPost-bad83fe9-727a-5f3b-a0e6-5d63622b451e","nextId":"RedditPost-7f3e998c-6229-5cca-a90c-e180d9af4f20","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7uje6/if_you_like_to_play_longterm_pltr_under_26_is_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
