Also for those of you who are experiencing something similar, I want you to know you can make it. So without further ado, here is my story (proof).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/3r1pNVX\">https://ibb.co/3r1pNVX</a></p>\n\n<p>For every gains porn post someone out there is on the other end with a loss. I can still remember when the GME runup began. I was so sure it would blow over in a day, and I picked up 10k in 3 month out puts just as GME crested 40 dollars. I remember as it skyrocketed I even found myself up on my position as the I/V grew. But I wanted more and I was so sure it would be back to 4 dollars in a month or two. Lesson one, don&#39;t get too smart, and don&#39;t fight the market.</p>\n\n<p>Well, a few months rolled by and the expiration on my options was getting close, they had slashed in value down to a third and even though GME had fallen, they weren&#39;t worth what I paid for them. I could have cut my losses and been out about 5k. But this is where I made my second mistake. Trading options on emotion. I couldn&#39;t believe my puts were priced correctly so I rolled them out a few more months, and aggressively. My position was now 50k instead of 10k. I couldn&#39;t let go of my ego and take the loss.</p>\n\n<p>Well, as fate would have it, a few days later GME would rip back up into the 200s. My freshly rolled position, started collapsing, and fast. I remember sitting at work every day, constantly pulling out my phone and staring at the GME ticker, waiting for any drop, hoping to be saved. But, my salvation never came, and my position got worse and worse. Enter my third mistake, doubling down. At this point I was desperate. I wanted, needed, to make my money back, so I averaged down, and averaged down again. My position was now worth just over 100k.</p>\n\n<p>With each passing day, my position ticked down in value. I remember one day so vividly as I saw my losses pile up into the 80k range I noticed sharp pain in my chest. It had been getting harder and harder every day, and the extreme stress was taking a toll on my body. I held on for a few more days, but the pain was getting worse, and I was literally shaking (tm), from the stress. Finally I called it. I closed my position down a total of just over 100k. It was one of the hardest things I&#39;ve ever done. </p>\n\n<p>As pathetic as this sounds, I remember actually crying several times thinking about what an idiot I was. When you lose that kind of money, and for me this wasn&#39;t play money, it takes you to a dark place. I remember ringing in my head over and over, what was I thinking, how could I make such a mistake. It was one of my lowest points ever, and it felt like I would never feel normal again, anyone who has been in my shoes knows what I&#39;m talking about.</p>\n\n<p>Well, it&#39;s been 7 months sense then and I will never touch an option again. I know now that I have a gambling problem and I can&#39;t put myself in that kind of position. It has been hard, to come to terms with losing something I spent many years of my life building, but I have made it through. To anyone who is where I was, right now, I know how it feels, and I promise you the age old adage, time heals all wounds is true, it does get easier.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, thanks to anyone who read all the way through, I hope I can somebody out there learns from my mistakes, or at the very least cracks a smile laughing at my misfortune. I wouldn&#39;t be who I am now without my experience, so cheers you beautiful bastards.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnf8ot/my_story_100k_loss_not_just_play_money_to_me/","title":"My story: 100k loss, not just play money to me.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"November 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-05T19:45:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-05 19:45","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qnf8ot","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnf8ot/my_story_100k_loss_not_just_play_money_to_me/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnf8ot/my_story_100k_loss_not_just_play_money_to_me/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/Pkr0rnR6Ohbua8AWfACf5i8SSEgQaL5F6SYpX-QnI7Y.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ebffa1453fe739d167eec381e220f9eb54c5a0ed","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Arcanon1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Arcanon1","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Arcanon1","score":1020,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私のストーリー 10万円の損失、私にとっては単なる遊び金ではありません。","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、私の失敗から学んでくれる人がいることを願って、私の体験談を紹介します。\n私の失敗から学んでくれることを願って。また、同じような経験をしている人たちのためにも。\n私はあなたがそれを作ることができることを知ってほしい。では、早速ですが、私のストーリーをご紹介します。\n(証拠)をご覧ください。\n\nhttps://ibb.co/3r1pNVX\n\nポルノ記事を投稿するたびに...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的故事 损失10万，对我来说不只是玩的钱。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们，我想分享我的故事，希望你们中的一些被告会从我的错误中学习\n从我的错误中学习。也为那些正在经历类似事情的人。\n我想让你知道你可以做到。因此，不再赘述，以下是我的故事\n(证明)。\n\nhttps://ibb.co/3r1pNVX\n\n对于每一个收益的色情帖子...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的故事 損失10萬，對我來說不只是玩的錢。","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們，我想分享我的故事，希望你們中的一些被告會從我的錯誤中學習\n從我的錯誤中學習。也爲那些正在經歷類似事情的人。\n我想讓你知道你可以做到。因此，不再贅述，以下是我的故事\n(證明)。\n\nhttps://ibb.co/3r1pNVX\n\n對於每一個收益的色情帖子...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qndcwg","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qndcwg/looking_to_change_my_401k_investments_i_am/","title":"Looking to change my 401k investments.
