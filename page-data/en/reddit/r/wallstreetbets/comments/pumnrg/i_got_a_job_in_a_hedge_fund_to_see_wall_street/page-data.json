I got the job right away, which was kinda suprising given my questionable trading knowlege and history. All I had to do was to take a simple aptitude test that checked my mental health, visionary goals and outlook on life and passed it with flying colours. Who knew?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway my first day came along and I was expecting the hedge fund to be an absolute boiler room of testostorone, swearing, crazy money and cocaine snorted off the buttcracks of hookers.</p>\n\n<p>Boy was I wrong.</p>\n\n<p>What an absolutely lovely environment to work in. When you walk in the door they greet you in the most pleasent way i&#39;ve ever been greeted when entering a company. The butler hands you a lovely hot towel smelling of jasmine before you head to your desk.</p>\n\n<p>The other trades were so humble, one of them was trading just so that he could pay for his grandmother&#39;s medical bills. Another was donating his entire salary to the homeless and living out of the back of his car. He didn&#39;t even drive a Lambo as well, it was a 12 year old Honda Civic.</p>\n\n<p>Every Friday the boss&#39;s secretary bakes cupcakes with dollar signs on them and gives them out to everyone in the morning. She&#39;s met with praise and admiration from everyone.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s not even the best bit. They do a monthly raffle, where everyone buys tickets for $10k each and the person who wins get to choose which orphanage to give all the money to.</p>\n\n<p>Were we wrong about hedge funds guys?</p>\n\n<p><sup>Mods please mark this post with the appropriate shitpost flair.</sup></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pumnrg/i_got_a_job_in_a_hedge_fund_to_see_wall_street/","title":"I got a job in a hedge fund to see Wall Street from the inside","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"September 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-24T20:38:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-24 20:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pumnrg","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pumnrg/i_got_a_job_in_a_hedge_fund_to_see_wall_street/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pumnrg/i_got_a_job_in_a_hedge_fund_to_see_wall_street/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Limewire-","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Limewire-","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Limewire-","score":4237,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ウォールストリートを内側から見るために、ヘッジファンドに就職した","the_new_excerpt":"ここ8ヶ月ほどのヘッジファンドのドラマを見て、私はこう思いました。\nヘッジファンドで働くということがどういうことなのか、見てみたいと思いました。\n実際にヘッジファンドで働いてみたら面白いんじゃないかと思って\n\nそこで、大手ヘッジファンドの1つに応募しました。すぐに仕事を得ることができました。\nこれはちょっと意外でしたね。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我在对冲基金找了份工作，想从内部了解华尔街。","the_new_excerpt":"因此，在过去八个月左右的时间里，在对冲基金的所有戏剧性事件之后，我\n我想，看看为对冲基金工作到底是什么样子，会非常有趣。\n基金是什么样子的。\n\n所以我申请了其中一个大基金的工作。我马上就得到了这份工作。\n这有点令人惊讶，因为我的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我在對沖基金找了份工作，想從內部瞭解華爾街。","the_new_excerpt":"因此，在過去八個月左右的時間裏，在對沖基金的所有戲劇性事件之後，我\n我想，看看爲對沖基金工作到底是什麼樣子，會非常有趣。\n基金是什麼樣子的。\n\n所以我申請了其中一個大基金的工作。我馬上就得到了這份工作。\n這有點令人驚訝，因爲我的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pukyn3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pukyn3/no_tendies_for_this_ape/","title":"No tendies for this ape","date":"September 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"この猿にはテンディがない","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"这只猿猴没有任何的天分","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"這隻猿猴沒有任何的天分","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pupmem","excerpt":"Since we have many threads about what stocks we think will rise, lets have one\nabout what stocks we think will fall.\n\nWhat do you think is overvalued?
