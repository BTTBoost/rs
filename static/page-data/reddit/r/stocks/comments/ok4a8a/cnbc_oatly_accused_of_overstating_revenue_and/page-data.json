Since then, it’s contributed to the surging demand for oat-based milk substitutes, primarily among coffee drinkers, and made its U.S. public market debut about two months ago. The stock is up 4.5% since its initial public offering, giving it a market value of $12.5 billion, as of Tuesday’s close.</p>\n\n<p>However, Spruce Point’s report claims that Oatly misled investors by omitting or manipulating key facts in its prospectus and a June investor presentation and argues that the company will never achieve profitability. The report is expected to be published Wednesday morning.</p>\n\n<p>“We don’t think any of this is in the narrative at the moment,” Spruce Point founder and Chief Investment Officer Ben Axler said in an interview. “We think this is a strong sell, and the stock price could be 70% overvalued.”</p>\n\n<p>Axler has previously taken short positions against other consumer packaged goods companies, like Church &amp; Dwight and Boulder Brands. Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, betting that the stock will fall. According to S3 Partners, about 1% of Oatly’s float, or the number of shares available on the market, is being shorted, as of Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>When reached by CNBC, an Oatly spokesperson didn’t have an immediate response to Spruce Point’s allegations.</p>\n\n<p>Accounting allegations</p>\n\n<p>Spruce Point alleges that Oatly has overstated both its revenue and margins to investors.</p>\n\n<p>The short seller’s report points to the company’s recent investor presentation, which showed estimated 2018 U.S. revenue of $12 million. The firm said that both Nielsen and Umgas Magazine, a Swedish publication, reported that Oatly’s net U.S. sales were just $6 million in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Spruce Point also cited the company’s filings with Companies House, the U.K. agency that stores information on limited companies.</p>\n\n<p>“We observe periods of large divergence in revenue and accounts receivable growth rates at Oatly,” the report said. “This is a classic sign of potential accounting shenanigans and is often cited as a top red flag to predict accounting scandals.”</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Spruce Point alleges that Oatly is overstating its gross margin. The company does not include outbound shipping and handling costs in its calculations, and fails to disclose that its gross profit presentation is not comparable to that of other food companies. The report alleges that Oatly’s gross margin is actually 6.4% lower when logistics and shipping are factored in.</p>\n\n<p>The firm also claimed to find anomalies about Oatly’s capital expenditures between its cash flow statement and additions to the balance sheet.</p>\n\n<p>Spruce Point argued that the company hasn’t been transparent with investors about key figures involved in its accounting and auditing. For example, Oatly has allegedly run through three auditors in six years, a fact that was not disclosed in its filings to go public.</p>\n\n<p>“From our experience this is highly unusual,” the report said. ”... While auditor rotations can be viewed positively, we believe three auditors in six years is excessive in light of the accounting anomalies we have identified related to sales, gross margins, inventories and capex.”</p>\n\n<p>Oatly’s current auditor is Ernst &amp; Young, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n\n<p>The report noted that Chief Financial Officer Christian Hanke’s biography on the company’s investor relations website does not make note of his role as the manager of financial reporting for Stratus Technologies from 1999 to 2005. During that time, the company had to restate its financial results for fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Hanke does disclose the job on his LinkedIn page.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Oatly appointed Frances Rathke as chair of its audit committee. In her time as chief financial officer, treasurer and chief accounting officer of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the SEC investigated the company’s accounting practices, forcing the company to restate its financial results. Rathke’s biography on Oatly’s website does not include her former role as the coffee company’s chief accounting officer. Her LinkedIn page details her time with the company.</p>\n\n<p>Claims of greenwashing</p>\n\n<p>Oatly has also branded itself as a more sustainable option than cow’s milk or other nondairy alternatives to both consumers and investors. But Spruce Point alleges that the company has been giving a misleading impression of its green credentials, which is known as greenwashing, and putting its global expansion ahead of its mission.</p>\n\n<p>Among the examples it cites is the company’s June 2021 presentation to investors, which uses data based on a 2013 study that was updated three years later. The data does not include the impact of the company’s expansion into Asia or the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Spruce Point also alleges that Oatly has cherry picked the data by omitting that its water consumption is higher than that of making cow’s milk. The company’s 2019 sustainability report also showed that its New Jersey plant was using 55% more water for every liter of oat base than its facilities in Sweden and the Netherlands.</p>\n\n<p>For several quarters, the New Jersey facility has been out of compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency, the report said. The EPA’s website does not identify what the violation or violations are.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the hedge fund obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act request to Millville, New Jersey that showed issues with the plant’s wastewater in 2019, but the company has not yet opened a wastewater treatment facility.</p>\n\n<p>“They’ve had very high levels of wastewater as a byproduct, but they’ve known since 2019, and they’re still in the process of dealing with that,” Axler said.</p>\n\n<p>The report also points to Oatly’s transportation as a major source of its environmental impact. According to Spruce Point, the company sources its oats from Western Canada and then ships them to its facility in New Jersey. For its expansion into Asia, Oatly is sourcing its oats from Sweden.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ok4a8a/cnbc_oatly_accused_of_overstating_revenue_and/","title":"[CNBC] Oatly accused of overstating revenue and greenwashing by activist short Spruce Point","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-14T16:54:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-14 16:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dcfe6573-b7fa-5be1-b337-621aaa05b2c0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ok4a8a/cnbc_oatly_accused_of_overstating_revenue_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ok4a8a/cnbc_oatly_accused_of_overstating_revenue_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"playlikechampions","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/playlikechampions","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"playlikechampions","score":551,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[CNBC] Oatly社、収益の過大計上とグリーンウォッシュでアクティビストのショートSpruce Point社から非難される","the_new_excerpt":"Oatly社、収益の過大計上とグリーンウォッシュを活動家のショート・スプルース氏が告発\nポイント\n\n- アクティビストのショートセラーであるSpruce Point Capital Management社は、Oatly社を以下のように非難しました。\n疑わしい会計処理とグリーンウォッシングを非難しました。\n\n- 同社は、Oatly社が投資家に対して収益とマージンの両方を誇張していると主張しています。\n投資家に対して\n\n-...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"[CNBC]Oatly被激进的做空者Spruce Point指责夸大收入和洗绿行为","the_new_excerpt":"Oatly被活动家短Spruce指责夸大收入和洗绿行为\n观点\n\n- 激进的卖空者Spruce Point资本管理公司指责Oatly的\n阴暗的会计做法和洗绿行为。\n\n- 该公司称，Oatly向投资者夸大了其收入和利润率。\n投资者。\n\n-...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[CNBC]Oatly被激進的做空者Spruce Point指責誇大收入和洗綠行爲","the_new_excerpt":"Oatly被活動家短Spruce指責誇大收入和洗綠行爲\n觀點\n\n- 激進的賣空者Spruce Point資本管理公司指責Oatly的\n陰暗的會計做法和洗綠行爲。\n\n- 該公司稱，Oatly向投資者誇大了其收入和利潤率。\n投資者。\n\n-...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-139e3f78-e19f-5586-95ed-e600236b3382","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok31zb/sometimes_its_best_not_to_overthink_investing/","title":"Sometimes it's best not to overthink investing","date":"July 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投資は考えすぎないほうがいいこともある","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"有时最好不要过度考虑投资问题","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"有時最好不要過度考慮投資問題","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-b71ce6a9-387e-5646-9d1f-f4770ebcee13","excerpt":"> Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday reported a narrower than expected loss in\n> the second quarter, with \"accelerating demand\" putting the airline back on a\n> path to profitability.\n> \n> Here are the main results from the Q2 report, compared to consensus estimates\n> compiled by Bloomberg:\n> \n>…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ok2kza/delta_sharply_narrows_losses_in_q2_as_ceo_sees/","title":"Delta sharply narrows losses in Q2 as CEO sees return to profitability this quarter","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 14, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"デルタ航空、第2四半期に損失を大幅に縮小、CEOは今期中に黒字化を見込む","the_new_excerpt":"> 水曜日に発表されたデルタ航空（DAL）の第2四半期決算は、予想を上回る赤字となりました。\n> 第2四半期の赤字幅は予想よりも縮小し、「需要の加速」により黒字化への道を再開しました。\n> 需要の加速により、航空会社は黒字化への道を歩み始めました。\n> \n> 以下は、第2四半期報告書の主な結果とコンセンサス予想との比較です。\n> ブルームバーグがまとめたものです。\n> \n>...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"达美航空第二季度大幅收窄亏损，首席执行官认为本季度可恢复盈利","the_new_excerpt":"> 达美航空(DAL)周三报告称，第二季度的亏损比预期的要小。\n> 第二季度，\"加速的需求 \"使该航空公司重新走上了\n> 盈利的道路。\n> \n> 以下是第二季度报告的主要结果，与一致预期相比\n> 由彭博社编撰。\n> \n>...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"達美航空第二季度大幅收窄虧損，首席執行官認爲本季度可恢復盈利","the_new_excerpt":"> 達美航空(DAL)週三報告稱，第二季度的虧損比預期的要小。\n> 第二季度，\"加速的需求 \"使該航空公司重新走上了\n> 盈利的道路。\n> \n> 以下是第二季度報告的主要結果，與一致預期相比\n> 由彭博社編撰。\n> \n>...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-dcfe6573-b7fa-5be1-b337-621aaa05b2c0","previousId":"RedditPost-139e3f78-e19f-5586-95ed-e600236b3382","nextId":"RedditPost-b71ce6a9-387e-5646-9d1f-f4770ebcee13","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ok4a8a/cnbc_oatly_accused_of_overstating_revenue_and/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
