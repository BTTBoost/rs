Somehow reddit messed them up when copy pasting.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a comment in the comment section from a Seeking Alpha user “GrowthandValu” posted on an article “Palantir: Explaining The Unexplainable” on (published date Aug. 25, 2021 11:32 AM ET)</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately reddit doesn’t allow links from SA.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is the best “bear case” summary of PLTR so far. However, it would be interesting to read some input from other people who have touched Palantir - maybe they will have very different thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>I hold some PLTR myself so I am interested in both: bull and bear sides. And I am interested in what people will have to say after reading this.</p>\n\n<p>The comment:</p>\n\n<p>“This is simple. There is no mystery here. They like to create a mystique about themselves by overstating their role in projects, but there is absolutely no mystery.\nI will preface this by saying I have known this company for over 10 of their near 20 years. I know former salespeople and engineers, and I know current salespeople and other client facing employees. I have also been directly involved in this industry for 25 years and I sell roughly $15 mil a year on average in professional services for BI/Data/AI initiatives to about a dozen Fortune 1000 companies. I work as an account director for a publicly traded consulting firm, but I began my career in a technical capacity (data warehousing, modeling, coding, BI, analytics) and transitioned here about 11 years ago. That said...\nPalantir <strong>software</strong> is a Business Intelligence platform with advanced data integration capabilities. This platform is an <strong>enabler</strong> of deep analytics and AI. Neither main component is unique in any sense of the word.</p>\n\n<p>High level, Foundry is essentially a MicroStrategy clone. It has a server that maps data sources into a logical model of objects that makes them easy to use for reporting and analytics. It has a good &quot;in memory&quot; capability in terms of local data storage, but it also can &quot;live query&quot; source data. There is a visualization component for web and mobile with all the basics. (mapping, data grids, charts, graphs, etc.) MicroStrategy is the best comparator, but Cognos, BOBJ, and OBIEE are also enterprise grade peers.\nGotham is basically an ETL tool that connects to data. It can bring in multiple streams and relate data sets so that they can be reported on and analyzed in a single view. It has a decent associative engine, but nothing better than anything else, and it requires a lot of human intervention. Foundry leverages the &quot;model&quot; Gotham creates. When you hear Gotham, think Ab Initio, Informatica, Talend, ADF, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Inside of these components you can write code/algorithms with Python, R, etc. that seek a variety of things. You need to know the use case and where to look, of course. Some seem to feel there is a &quot;magic button&quot; you click and it tells you when the next embassy bombing will take place. (HINT: It doesn&#39;t)\nData is just data. It can be numeric, text, binary, image, etc., but it has no character, no emotion, no intelligence. Human need to understand what that data represents, then they code for what they want.\nFacial recognition is an awesome example. The process doesn&#39;t compare pictures, it is comparing the numerical expressions behind them, and it associates common expressions as a linked result. Google photos is a great example.</p>\n\n<p>Palantir is a platform that can do this, BUT -- big BUT -- they didn&#39;t invent anything. Let&#39;s pretend they are looking for possible terrorists in an airport. They start with a known set of images. Then a camera sends images to a server, the numeric translation is run, the result is compared to the numeric strings that are stored, and if there is a high probability of a match, an alert pops up.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, this is a query. You are taking in a variable and comparing it to a set of literals. Palantir <strong>enables</strong> this functionality, they didn&#39;t invent it, and it certainly is not unique. Some good coders can make it sing, but it is a human effort.</p>\n\n<p>That is just one example.</p>\n\n<p>So, Palantir as a platform is ordinary. Feel free to argue the finer points, but the competition is endless, not to mention cheaper. Most enterprises these days are recreating enterprise BI platforms in the aggregate by using something like Talend and Databricks in between source data and presentation layer, for example.\nNow, Palantir as a <strong>business</strong> is a different story entirely. They made a very calculated and firm decision to focus on the federal space, not commercial. They built a platform that was meant to run largely on-prem (or in their cloud) and it required a lot of horsepower. They opted not have a real partner program, so they maintained full control of sales and delivery. They essentially turned themselves into a federal consultancy that catered to government use cases. Their software has been approved, they have a known procurement method, and they know how to work together well with government. Palantir hires smart, expensive, US citizens (no offshore or H1 for gov&#39;t) to implement. They call them Forward Deployed Engineers, but they are just developers, business analysts, and PMs. These people are hard to find and hire at scale. The bulk of their work is fixed price, not T&amp;M. They understand federal budgets and how to win these contracts. They primary &quot;fix price&quot; bid, which conceals rates and allows play with license. (Software and consulting are accounted for differently on both sides) Their terms are also fixed, say 3 years. Up front price basically includes maintenance for the term. After 3 years then you start again. I know there is chatter now about different models, but I will believe it when I see it.</p>\n\n<p>I am generalizing, but this is essentially how they operate. Unfortunately, that model doesn&#39;t scale at all, as they have no outside sales channels, no partners, and no delivery scale.</p>\n\n<p>Software companies rely heavily on partners. When I say partner, think Cognizant, Accenture, etc. These are &quot;scale&quot; partners who are everywhere and can have great influence over commercial spend. They also have the resources to implement. Software companies have SAAS offerings and relationships with the major cloud platforms. They have consulting arms, but they are generally more software focused and technical, not business focused. They install, they guide, but they rarely do large implementations over a long period of time.</p>\n\n<p>The commercial space doesn&#39;t play the game that Palantir wants them to play. It hasn&#39;t happened in 20 years and unless PLTR completely changes course, it will never happen.\nNever.</p>\n\n<p>I mention Databricks above. They are a software company and their platform is a superior alternative to much of what Palantir is. They have been in existence for 8 years and have over 6,000 clients and growing. Palantir has been around for 2 decades now and has 146 clients total. How many are net new and over $1 mil. in the last 12 months? I bet not many.\nWhy is that? Why is such a &quot;superior&quot; platform lagging so poorly in an industry that keeps exploding? I don&#39;t know...</p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t talk about stock compensation, valuation, or anything else. I am merely pointing out what Palantir is and how they generally operate. It is obvious how misunderstood they are, mostly because of slick marketing (outrageous in many cases) and Cathie Wood.</p>\n\n<p>In summation:\n- Business Intelligence and data integration software\n- Very expensive compared to a multitude of competitors and options\n- Business model geared to federal, not commercial\n- Heavy consulting model that doesn&#39;t scale well and hurts margins\n- No real partner program or channels for sales or implementation</p>\n\n<p>I hope that helps some of you.”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pedzyo/the_best_pltr_bear_case_i_found/","title":"The best PLTR bear case I found","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-30T12:31:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-30 12:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"bf38cb53-01f0-5d1a-93b2-bae569caef2f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pedzyo/the_best_pltr_bear_case_i_found/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pedzyo/the_best_pltr_bear_case_i_found/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"clint1reid","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/clint1reid","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"clint1reid","score":248,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私が見つけた最高のPLTRベアケース","the_new_excerpt":"更新：段落を追加しました。なぜかredditがコピーペーストの際にそれらを混乱させてしまいました。\n\n以下は、Seeking Alphaのユーザーからのコメント欄のコメントです。\n\"GrowthandValu \"が投稿した記事「Palantir: Explaining The Unexplainable」に掲載されたものです。\n(公開日 2021年8月25日 11:32 AM ET)\n\n残念ながらreddit...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我发现的最好的PLTR熊皮箱","the_new_excerpt":"更新：增加了段落。在复制粘贴时，reddit不知怎么把它们弄乱了。\n\n以下是一位Seeking Alpha用户在评论区的评论\n\"GrowthandValu \"在一篇名为 \"Palantir。解释无法解释的事情 \"一文上发表的评论。\n(发布日期：2021年8月25日 美国东部时间上午11:32）。)\n\n不幸的是reddit...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我發現的最好的PLTR熊皮箱","the_new_excerpt":"更新：增加了段落。在複製粘貼時，reddit不知怎麼把它們弄亂了。\n\n以下是一位Seeking Alpha用戶在評論區的評論\n\"GrowthandValu \"在一篇名爲 \"Palantir。解釋無法解釋的事情 \"一文上發表的評論。\n(發佈日期：2021年8月25日 美國東部時間上午11:32）。)\n\n不幸的是reddit...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4d902e25-fb0b-505b-bf86-1d8bfa41652d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/peffv5/when_i_see_your_well_written_market_crash/","title":"When I see your well written Market Crash imminent DD","date":"August 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"あなたのよく書かれたMarket Crash imminent DDを見ると","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"当我看到你精心撰写的《市场崩溃在即》DD","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當我看到你精心撰寫的《市場崩潰在即》DD","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-0cff0780-1acf-5944-85ae-4ed8d4bf2f41","excerpt":"Hello,\n\nI am 30, and I have 10K to invest in stocks for 10+ years.\n\nI have a high risk tolerance, and I am looking for growth.\n\nWhat do you think ifI Invest $1000 in those 10 ETF :\n\n 1.
