&lt;p&gt;The company also disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter outlook, indicating that sales aren’t expected to snap back immediately. Shares of the company tumbled 18% in extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss per share: 87 cents vs. 39 cents expected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue: $106.4 million vs. $109.2 million expected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond reported fiscal third-quarter net loss of $54.8 million, or 87 cents per share, wider than a net loss of $19.3 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected a loss of 39 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company said it faced higher transportation and warehousing costs and increased its inventory write-offs, which hurt its profits. About $9 million was written off due to water damage at one of its plants, which mostly affected packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net sales rose 12.7% to $106.4 million, missing expectations of $109.2 million. Compared with the second quarter, its revenue fell, bucking typical seasonal trends for the company’s products. Customers usually buy more Beyond Burgers during the summer to grill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company reported strong growth outside the United States, with international grocery and restaurant divisions each seeing sales more than double during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, U.S. revenue fell 13.9% compared with a year ago, mostly due to weaker grocery demand. CEO Ethan Brown told analysts that grocery sales didn’t help make up for shrinking food service orders, unlike in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also said softer demand and operational challenges, like severe weather, hurt its domestic sales. Brown said new competitors in the market are putting pressure on its market share, but data doesn’t reveal that the lower demand is due to other companies stealing its customers. New products, like its meatless chicken, slightly offset U.S. sales declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, the company warned investors that it would be reporting weaker sales than it had previously predicted, citing a wide range of factors, including the delta variant and distribution problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the company’s forecast doesn’t indicate a sunnier fourth quarter. Beyond is predicting net sales of $85 million to $110 million for those three months. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $131.6 million during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond said it’s expecting some of the operational challenges from the third quarter to drag down its fourth-quarter results as well. It also cited restaurants’ labor challenges and hesitant ordering behavior due to uncertainty tied to the pandemic as other factors embedded in the outlook. The company noted that the period contains 5 fewer shipping days than a year prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Near-term market and operating conditions notwithstanding, we remain committed to our long-term strategy,” Brown said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told analysts he is feeling optimistic about 2022. He hinted at new product launches coming next year, saying that some of those items could reach price parity with meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She likes the idea of &amp;quot;your age in bonds,&amp;quot; though she is willing to compromise on 80% equities and 20% fixed income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fortunate enough to be able to max out our 401(k) and Roth IRA and have a bit left over for investments in a taxable account. &lt;strong&gt;With that in mind, my question is... would your asset allocation plan change if you had $5,000 / yr to invest vs. what we currently do?&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, all things being equal, can you afford to be more aggressive as the value of your portfolio increases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: We compromised on 80% equities / 20% bonds as long as I get to invest a bit more of our emergency fund in I bonds. Case closed :) Thanks for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of caveats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can share other stories that&amp;#39;s not AMD or NVDA, but try to keep it in the tech growth sector if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dizzying rally in the stock market came to a screeching halt following the release of a key inflation report that showed a greater than expected jump in consumer prices despite new jobless claims coming in at a pandemic-era low. The S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.8% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.47% in its third consecutive red day while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.61% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 1.58% lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Fed has commenced a tapering in the pace of quantitative easing, members of the Fed have so far maintained that supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances caused by the pandemic have prevented producers from keeping up with demand, particularly as we head into the busiest time of the year, the holiday season. I broadly agree with this narrative, even the Fed has conceded that inflation could last longer “than they currently assume”. The latest Fed meeting minutes said, “Most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.” We’ll have to see what happens in the coming months, if inflation doesn’t begin moderating in the next 5-6 months, the Fed will likely be forced to step in and raise interest rates in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No highlights today sorry, will be back tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today, between Evergrande, crypto, and lord knows what else, there are plenty of reasons for uncertainty. I don&amp;#39;t have an investing diary, exactly, but I have a pretty good account of my own investor sentiment since I started investing in 2013. My approach was Bogle-inspired, although as I note, I shifted a bit (often for bad reasons). I thought I might share them, as a good representation of timing the market, as well as illustrating other cognitive biases one might have (e.g. the way we can become overcommitted to a strategy once we have emotionally invested in it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 2015: I started to get worried when the Shiller forward P/E went above 25, the level it was before the 2008 financial crisis. I have generally fretted about this, and the Buffet indicator (market cap: GDP) since then. I did shift my portfolio from being 100% domestic to include international index funds at this point (not that it did any good).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 2016: I thought Trump winning the 2016 election would tank the markets (actually it did briefly upset overnight futures markets). It didn&amp;#39;t, of course. Rather, the market boomed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2017: I still remember the cover of The Economist. &amp;quot;The bull market in everything&amp;quot;. I was sure that there was something afoot. There would be a few subsequent moments that felt like &amp;quot;now it&amp;#39;s about to start&amp;quot;. In February 2018 the VIX surged as the trade war accelerated and the Fed raised rates above 1%. There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; (and this points to the difficulty of timing) a sharp correction in December 2018, but the market almost immediately recovered.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 2019: the yield curve inverted, and once again I began to thought that the end was nigh. There was going to be a recession and that was it. The rise of the S&amp;amp;P 500 into early 2020 felt suspicious to me. Arguably, this is the one time my gut might have been right. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; I was right for the wrong reasons. The crash of 2020 was caused by the pandemic, which I obviously hadn&amp;#39;t considered in August 2019 (nor even in January 2020). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 9, 2020: now, those were crazy times my friend. Some days were up double-digits and some were down by the same. It was circuit breaker city, man. Critically though, the signs of a financial crisis were there - repo markets were drying up and even treasuries were dropping.On March 9th I came damn close to shifting large amounts of my portfolio into bonds. I still have the trade confirmation, though I stopped it at the last second. The S&amp;amp;P 500 had fallen to something like 2800.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 9, 2020: I held through the bottom, when a strange thing started happening. The market recovered very rapidly. In a few days the S&amp;amp;P 500 was up from a low of something in the 2200s to almost 2800. I thought there was no way it could keep going like this. I remember looking at graphs (which people were posting widely at the time) showing the market through the Great Depression. One of the striking takeaways was that it hadn&amp;#39;t just been down down down followed by recovery. There were so many bear traps. Could this be one of them? It was at this point that I broke from Bogle advice. As the market recovered, I shifted modest amounts into bonds reasoning that when the real bottom appeared I would buy everything cheap. A completely irrational factor in my move: relatives bragging that they saw the crash coming and pulled everything out just in time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 6, 2020: as my fear of bear traps receded, I reverted back to my long-term optimal portfolio. One day later, the market saw the biggest crash since the heady days of March. A-ha! I thought. It turns out I was right all along. And &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I was - unemployment had just hit the highest levels since the Great Depression, some states were prematurely reopening from the pandemic, etc. I didn&amp;#39;t sell everything, but I maintained an overly bond-heavy portfolio for my age (mid-30s). As the market rose further in July and August, I continued to shift assets to bonds (I also shifted my bond holdings to TIPS which did work out... so far). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2020: through August I had read the story about Softbank&amp;#39;s sometimes insane bets on tech, and was again sure that a crash was nigh. I felt bearish - one day I went running in the woods and literally saw a family of black bears crossing the road. And indeed, the S&amp;amp;P 500 started to correct (the Nasdaq somewhat more). And yet... pretty soon after, it was back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 22, 2021: this story involves my active trading account, which represents a very small proportion of my investments. When GME started to surge to $65 (vs. $4 in August 2020) following the beginnings of the campaign on Wall Street Bets, I was sure that the stock would fall. I bought OTM puts. When it rose more, I bought more OTM puts - and I even was able to time the peak correctly the second time. Obviously, the first set of puts became worthless, but interestingly, so did the second because I had bought them when volatility was so high that the stock would have to hit ridiculously low levels for my puts to print.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure that there are other folks out there who are better investors than I. Maybe they have the time to do research and find diamonds in the rough. Maybe they have the discipline to avoid going double or nothing (and to resist confirmation bias) when their theses prove false. And hey, maybe they are smarter and possessed of some abilities that I lack. But I would have to say that the smartest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done is to ignore my instincts, saved, diversified, and waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Evergrande, the troubled property giant, made interest payments on at least two of its bonds on Wednesday, a company bondholder said, a sign that it yet again managed to head off default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evergrande owed investors interest payments totaling nearly $150 million on three bonds, with the grace periods for those payments set to expire on Wednesday. Missing them would have triggered a default that could ripple through the Chinese economy: With some $300 billion in debt outstanding, the company’s inability to pay its debt would potentially hurt banks, property developers, and even home buyers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the company has managed to leap from one deadline to the next, meeting its obligations at the last minute — but often without explaining how or even publicly disclosing that it had done so. The company has tried to sell off parts of its empire to raise enough cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, when Evergrande said it had scrapped its effort to sell a $2.6 billion stake in its property services company to another developer, the company warned in a Hong Kong securities filing that there was “no guarantee” it would be able to meet its financial obligations or negotiate an extension with its creditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the company met its interest payment deadline for bonds that mature in 2022 and 2023, the company bondholder said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person did not specify if a payment on the third bond had also been made, but Bloomberg News reported that obligations for all three bonds were met, citing a spokesman for a clearing house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Evergrande has managed to avoid default so far, its troubles have already begun to weigh on other Chinese developers, with the government tightening controls on borrowing and investors retreating from the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least six Chinese property developers have defaulted on foreign bonds in recent weeks, rattling domestic financial markets and raising the cost of borrowing for all Chinese companies. Property prices are slowing and fewer people are buying apartments, worsening the outlook for real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evergrande’s challenges could spread outside of China as well, as they ripple through global financial markets. On Monday, the Federal Reserve said troubles in China’s property sector could threaten the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through a deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States,” the Fed said in its twice-yearly update on the American financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

Should I also sell these at a loss and put them into passive investing?  I know all future deposits will go into passive investing but wondering about what to do with my older less wise purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, the company is launching Omniverse Replicator, an engine that generates the vast amounts of data needed to train the deep neural networks that constitute AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Omniverse Replicator, Nvidia announced DRIVE Sim, which closes the gaps and increases the fidelity between virtual and actual worlds to help autonomous cars better perceive and navigate their environment and respond to rapid changes. DRIVE Sim can also be paired with Omniverse Avatar that would allow not only for an AI chauffeur but also a concierge in one’s car, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another positive announcement by Nvidia to leading the AI field. It is clearly that Metaverse is what Nvidia want to concentrate going forward and invest heavily to develop more powerful AI chips. There are a lot of potentials for Nvidia to develop and the stock will become part of MAMAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone asked &amp;quot;semi-serious question, but why have we ever cared about what Michael Burry thinks?&amp;quot;  This was my answer, and I think it&amp;#39;s important enough to warrant its own discussion.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People care because the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was such a devastating and world-shattering event. It&amp;#39;s basically unprecedented in our times. The only thing that comes close to it is the Great Depression, but you could argue that 2008 was even more shocking given the fact that an advanced, modern, technology-based financial system came to the brink of complete and utter failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That in and of itself leads to a compelling story. But what truly makes the whole thing amazing is the fact that people went on about their business like everything was fine, everything was great, and that we had entered into a new era of prosperity where nothing would or could go wrong. People like Burry were scorned, marginalized and laughed at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s truly amazing that the mob had no idea they were on the verge of one of the greatest societal disasters of our lifetimes. They were walking towards a precipice, blissfully unaware, and when the whole thing came crashing down, there was suddenly real fear that nothing was ever going to be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most people around here don&amp;#39;t understand just how scary the 2008 crisis was, and just how close we came to total financial meltdown. In retrospect it&amp;#39;s hard to appreciate how blissfully unaware just about anyone who&amp;#39;s anyone was about the possibility of this occurring. Those who were around and paying attention at the time seem to have forgotten, but that&amp;#39;s in part because of the emergency measures taken by central banks around the world which helped pump asset prices but still haven&amp;#39;t restored the real economy to normality. 13 years later and monetary policy still hasn&amp;#39;t been normalized. The scars are still being felt around the world. Inequality is on the rise in the US, directly resulting in the populism we saw from 2016-2020, and Spain, the country where I live, has become a shadow of what it what it was pre-housing boom. This is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you wouldn&amp;#39;t think it was a big deal if you&amp;#39;re just a middle or upper class stock market investor. You&amp;#39;re doing OK. The crowd marches onward, blissfully ignorant of the fact that the economy and markets are complex adaptive systems that have the potential for failure at any moment. Unprecedented liquidity and monetary policy do not help this situation, and even Bernanke spoke about weighing the &amp;quot;costs and risks&amp;quot; of these policies when they were first implemented 13 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going to happen, but the mystique around Burry is that he was seemingly the only one who was sensible at a time when the rest of the world was marching blindly off a cliff. I think for a lot of people he&amp;#39;s seen as the voice of reason against human greed, ignorance, and stupidity. Burry was always an outcast, and it took an outcast to say &amp;quot;hey, what the mob is doing isn&amp;#39;t right&amp;quot;. It took courage, and it took vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s going to happen going forward, I don&amp;#39;t know. But to those of us who feel the world is a little more complicated than most people want to let on, and that markets (and life) aren&amp;#39;t always smooth sailing, Michael Burry represents an alternative voice.  It&amp;#39;s a voice that&amp;#39;s willing to call things as they are, even if it&amp;#39;s not always comfortable to look at them that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, it&amp;#39;s not about raining on a parade, or preaching gloom and doom.  It&amp;#39;s about seeking prosperity in a way that is sustainable and just, and moving forward in a way which takes into account the risks and does an adequate job of preparing for them.  True prosperity cannot be founded on lies and wishful thinking, and 2008 was the perfect illustration of that.&lt;/p&gt;

No I am not telling you exactly what company to buy. I am aiming to give you food for thought if you are in disbelief about the current market situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started investing 5 years ago and have beaten the market by CAGR with a good margin ever since (20% vs SP500 14% something). Most of it I attribute to value investing. A school of investing that has consistently outperformed growth investing besides the past half decade. The basic idea is to invest in sound undervalued stocks with a margin of security to minimize risk and maximize upside in all market environments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not go intro details but if you want to read into it go for Benjamin Graham, Buffett, Lynch. A good start could be Modern Value Investing by Sven Carlin, a PhD Prof. in Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s market situation is incredible to say the least. We have rising CPI, money printing, Infrastructure Bills, Defaults in China, Tapering, Fake money velocity being created with the intent of kicking the can down the road in hopes of not hitting it off a cliff soon because it will happen. On top of that a high and rising CAPE (Shiller) of almost 40! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high CAPE is correlated to low future stock market returns. A Shiller this high signals 0 to NEGATIVE avg SP500 returns. This could also go on for years so that we could see stagnation is the market for 5 - 10 - 15 years even. The point is not if this will happen, we have empirical data on this, but that is only a matter of time until it does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSLA is maybe the mascot of this circus alongside Altcoins and the Crypto boom. If you made money until now, great for you. If you are thinking of jumping in now, understand that overpaying for equity is at least as bad as buying bad equity. Again, there is empirical data on the correlation of high valuation and low future equity returns. If you buy most equities right now without thorough anaysis and valuation you will guarantee yourself low returns in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on about what dangers lie ahead and why now is the worse time to jump into trendy stocks. But let&amp;#39;s talk now about how to hedge yourself from downturn in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedging at its core deals with minimizing risk of total loss through different strategies. These strategies start from derivative plays to metals and global diversification. So let me present you some ways to limit your downside down the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currency Hedging ( Gold Miners, Miner ETFs, Fixed rate Debt) 
Use this if you think the USD will lose power. Buffett&amp;#39;s words &amp;quot;gold is going long fear&amp;quot;. Fear is spreding and capital will slowly flow into this asset class. Gold goes up and you are protected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derivatives (buying SP500 Puts) 
A very simple straight to the point thing to do is buying puts on the US economy via LEAPS. The risk lies in the fact that you need to be right 2 times. Once on the direction of the market and once on the time frame. Longer LEAPS cost a lot so it depends on your liquidity if you can/want/should do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diversify globally ( China, Europe, Russia) 
Get your hand on good, undervalued global stocks. Most other regions have lower CAPE than the US. Germany is looking good for this alongside China with the recent BABA drop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep some cash 
Cash can only be lost to theft and inflation. Keeping 15 - 20% in cash might not be that bad since a market crash would present amazing buying opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular saying is &amp;quot;value investing is dead&amp;quot;. I would argue for the fact that growth investing is dead for the moment. We are at the end of a huge debt cycle. This, just like valuation needs to return to the mean sooner or later. The next period will be favorable for value investing as the house of cards begins to crash down. You will be down a bit if you follow this strategy but you will secure your profits in the long run. This will help your compounding overall. When the crash comes, be prepared to find bargains and go all in. You will thank yourself later.&lt;/p&gt;

DMSA itself is invested in these bonds and has not received any interest payments until today&amp;#39;s end of the grace period. Now DMSA is preparing bankruptcy proceedings against Evergrande and calls on all bond investors to join it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Evergrande Group, the second largest real estate developer in China, defaulted on interest payments on two bonds back in September, with the 30-day grace period still ending in October. However, shortly before the end of the grace period, the public was misled by rumors about alleged interest payments. The international media also took the rumors for granted. Only the DMSA - Deutsche Marktscreening Agentur (German Market Screening Agency) already recognized the default at that time and proved in a study that the bankruptcy of Evergrande, the world&amp;#39;s most indebted corporation, could ultimately lead to a &amp;quot;Great Reset&amp;quot;, i.e. the final meltdown of the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note to journalists: See DMSA press releases dated Oct. 25 and Oct. 29, 2021, and the DMSA study &amp;quot;The Great Reset - Evergrande and the Final Meltdown of the Global Financial System&amp;quot;; all available via the DMSA homepage &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmsa-agentur.de/&quot;&gt;www.dmsa-agentur.de&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But while the international financial market has so far met the financial turmoil surrounding the teetering giant Evergrande with a remarkable basic confidence - one can also say: with remarkable naivety - the U.S. central bank Fed confirmed our view yesterday,&amp;quot; says DMSA senior analyst Dr. Marco Metzler. &amp;quot;In its latest stability report, it explicitly pointed out the dangers that a collapse of Evergrande could have for the global financial system.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to file for bankruptcy against the company as a creditor, DMSA itself invested in Evergrande bonds, whose grace period expired today (Nov. 10, 2021). In total, Evergrande would have had to pay $148.13 million in interest on three bonds no later than today. &amp;quot;But so far we have not received any interest on our bonds,&amp;quot; explains Metzler. He adds, &amp;quot;With banks in Hong Kong closing today, it&amp;#39;s certain that these bonds have defaulted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note to editors: Exact details of the bonds that have defaulted so far can be found in the appendix to this press release.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly problematic for Evergrande: all 23 outstanding bonds have a cross-default clause. &amp;quot;This means that if a single one of these bonds defaults, all 23 outstanding bonds automatically have &amp;#39;default&amp;#39; status&amp;quot; DMSA senior analyst Metzler knows. However, this does not automatically result in a bankruptcy for Evergrande Group. To determine bankruptcy, a insolvency petition must be filed with the court. This can be done either by the company itself or by one or more of the company&amp;#39;s creditors. And this is precisely what is now planned. Metzler: &amp;quot;DMSA is preparing bankruptcy proceedings against Evergrande. We are already holding talks with other investors in this regard. We would be pleased if other investors were to join our action group.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the DMSA expert, it is clear: &amp;quot;As soon as a court opens insolvency proceedings, Evergrande will also be officially bankrupt - and that is only a matter of days.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I know this page is full of some legit senders and we like to throw it all on black. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what do we thinks going down with China? They defaulted 305 BILLION last month. And I believe 500 million or more of it was on American creditors. With a billion in our real estate here in the americas and another 3 billion around Europe? I think numbers could be a bit off but the default is a solid number that was calculated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reeks of 08. And of course people claim that they will be bailed out. Except someone’s going to hold the bag like JP and Lehman did in 08.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we know China and the US aren’t the friendliest buddies. Or even Europe for that matter. What’s to stop them from pushing it to us? Who’s following this and what’s your plan or position? It’s easy to pull capital and “wait” but who knows how long that will be till the bottom drops and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt;

Then I discovered a certain meme stock in Jan and made many multiples off my initial investment. I should have realized that I got lucky getting in early but I was stubborn and overconfident. I started doing research on other sectors and individual stocks, and decided to allocate 25% of my net worth in an actively managed strategy. That strategy did not work very well. I either didn’t have conviction and sold or had too much conviction to sell when there were “bad signs” that indicated trouble. As a result, my actively managed portfolio has underperformed VT by 10%. I am still up 57% for the year (thanks to the initial meme stock and some crypto). I suppose I should feel grateful that I am still positive for the year but I can’t help but feel like I have failed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I want to sell everything and either go cash/DCA or go lump sum back into a broad market index fund. I have realized that it isn’t great for my mental health to obsess over my portfolio like this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see posts from people who have gotten insanely rich off this bull run and it makes me feel FOMO. But I have also seen people who blow up their portfolio and end up with nothing. It makes me wonder about the distribution of gains/losses by during this bull run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any advice for me? How do you deal with the FOMO?&lt;/p&gt;

In the previous analysis, we realized that the majority of gains were made from the listing itself and those who invested on listing day gained a measly 1.3%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/f4e0nywl7ry71.png?width=950&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5c9bb06a416c3cdedcd34b3e91c6f43af1e97f8b&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price&quot;&gt;less than 10% of the total IPO&lt;/a&gt; is allocated to retail investors. Adding to this, a multitude of other factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not in the end [2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the chances of you making it into the IPO allotment are bleak, what I wanted to analyze is, if we miss the IPO bus,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best time to buy into a recently IPO’d stock?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should it be on the listing day itself or should you wait a day, week, or even a month for all the hype surrounding the IPO to die down and the stock to come back to its “real” valuation [3]?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n5wmym9n7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3106183b0670cb5c790d5034bf7ee76a4ca194b&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have leveraged the same data source (iposcoop.com) that I used last time. They have documented almost all the IPOs from 2000. But for this analysis, I also needed stock price-related information for periods long after the stock had been listed in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock price information was obtained using Yahoo Finance. After all the quality checks, we are left with 1,063 IPOs from 2000-2020. All the data used in the analysis has been shared through a Google sheet at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/9skwwgan7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9789e067c476b12b7b962d587c002320623c388b&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the idea is to find the best time to invest in an IPO, we have to compare the returns for multiple time periods. I calculated the one month and one year returns in case you had invested on the day of the IPO as well as if you had invested in the stock after&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The returns are then compared against each other to find the optimal time to invest in the stock after it has IPO’d. The returns were finally benchmarked against SPY to see if it makes sense to put in all these efforts - only to maybe underperform the market!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/w2qnh2an7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6e659778bbe8aaf8893f5d6f2ea21288ef4b7a71&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/w2qnh2an7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6e659778bbe8aaf8893f5d6f2ea21288ef4b7a71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vknekrzo7ry71.png?width=730&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7fe4c5b99687e881d342df706a16fcd0ac0f255f&quot;&gt; All calculations are done using the adjusted closing price  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the gains you would have made from the IPOs are inversely proportional to the amount of time you waited for your investment. On average &lt;strong&gt;the most amount of return is obtained by someone who invested on the day of the IPO itself&lt;/strong&gt;. The more amount of time you wait for your investment, the lesser your return is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you are not interested in the short-term returns? What if you are a buy-and-hold type of investor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/uazvvt0q7ry71.png?width=730&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=38ff88f577596544308b493f072d66240507cc7d&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a long-term investor, &lt;strong&gt;you would be better off buying the IPO after waiting for a week&lt;/strong&gt;, as it generated the most amount of return. But what is interesting is that waiting a week for the hype to die down would only increase your return by 9%. Waiting any further would only &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;decrease your overall return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are planning on buying into an IPO but did not get an allocation at the listing price, you can wait a week so as to see how it performs in the market, avoid any large swings that the first week might cause, and still come out on top over the long run!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s compare the performance of IPO stocks against SPY. After all, even though you are getting a good return on your investment, if it does not beat the market, you would have been better off just investing it in SPY rather than doing all this research on IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ehviuevq7ry71.png?width=900&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=880c9f18392da5832a239819b38cd6dc04893875&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPOs’ returns on average &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;beat the market&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; over the last two decades. The trends are similar to the ones observed earlier with the delta over the market return depending on how much time you waited before investing into the IPO and generating the highest amount of delta by waiting one week from the day of the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it would be amiss not to discuss the inherent risks associated with investing in an IPO. Out of the 1,063 IPO’s in our analysis, only 62% of them gained in value and only a measly 29% of the IPOs beat the market over the long run. The outperformance over the market is coming due to a few outliers (Tesla - 25,000%+, Shopify - 5800%+, etc.) If you miss out on the top 1% of successful IPOs, your returns would be much lesser than the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5np1iman7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ed89afca9e90fdc3288899fcab548a8155beecdc&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above analysis comes with some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of IPOs in the analysis is approximately 1/3rd of the total IPOs which occurred during 2000-2020 [4]. I don’t think this is a major concern since our sample of 1000+ stocks would be much more than enough to give statistical significance to our analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another limitation is that the delta that you are observing here might just be due to the additional risk that you are taking by buying into lesser-known/small-cap companies. The risk-adjusted return might give a different result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing from the above point, we are currently in a massive bull run with ATH being broken every week. So the additional risk you are taking will be well rewarded but the outcome might look different if we do the same analysis in the middle of a bear market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qk5hm49s7ry71.png?width=1728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=77fe292757c841d6ecd666b499a9315e48595f25&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying into an IPO is an exciting prospect. Our analysis proves that even if you miss out on getting the IPO allocation, it’s still possible to beat the market by investing after the stock is listed on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/&quot;&gt;explained in my last post on IP&lt;/a&gt;O, investment banks are incentivized to slightly underprice while listing (unless it’s a really popular company) so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO) [5].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case may be, if you are planning on holding on to the IPO only for a short period of time, you can maximize your returns by investing in the IPO as soon as it’s listed whereas if you are a long term investor who is planning to hold on to the stock for a very long time, its better to wait a week or so for the stock price to settle before making your move!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] The company has &lt;a href=&quot;https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/&quot;&gt;only built and delivered 56&lt;/a&gt; vehicles as of Oct21. If Rivian IPO’d at $65 Billion, it means that each vehicle it delivered added more than $1 Billion in value to its shareholders. A similarly valued Ford delivered 4.1 Million vehicles in 2020. Truly wild times we are living in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html&quot;&gt;In the case of TD Ameritrade&lt;/a&gt;, your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3] Take the examples of Robinhood and Coinbase IPO. Robinhood tanked on listing day losing 8% only to rally almost 100% in the next one week before coming back down to near its IPO pricing. Coinbase also had a wild ride on listing day with the share price going as high as $429 before crashing back down to ~$310.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4] The major limitation was the absence of financial data in Yahoo Finance for certain stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5] There are a lot of contradictory opinions regarding this with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275531918309280&quot;&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; showcasing that IPO’s are usually undervalued while &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/17/3/811/1612977?redirectedFrom=PDF&quot;&gt;others argue&lt;/a&gt; that IPOs are overvalued. I guess you can twist data however you want to tell your story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Palantir Technologies look on track to extend their slide Wednesday after RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria downgraded the stock, warning of “cracks emerging in the story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaluria is concerned about a deceleration in Palantir’s government business as shown in the company’s Tuesday morning earnings commentary. While Jaluria had anticipated a slowdown, he noted that the growth rate for this part of the business was almost cut in half relative to the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palantir executives called out 34% growth in government revenue during the third quarter, while this segment was up 66% in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe Palantir got direct benefits from COVID-related spending and those benefits have already faded,” Jaluria wrote in his note to clients, while lowering his rating on Palantir’s stock to underperform from sector perform and cutting his price target to $19 from $25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Palantir are off more than 2% in premarket trading Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaluria also said that while Palantir’s commercial business continues to accelerate, he believes some of the growth there is due to a program through which the company makes strategic investments in earlier-stage businesses that then use its technology. “We do not believe revenue from S**C investments is sustainable, especially given the relatively small size of the companies Palantir is investing in,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palantir’s management team continues to expect revenue growth of at least 30% for this year and the following four years, but Jaluria views this target as “hard to underwrite” given the deceleration in the government business and his estimation of the impact that S**C investments are having on commercial growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We still believe Palantir has good technology and strong customer government relationships, but given the valuation, would like to see additional proof points of clean, sustainable 30%+ growth before getting more constructive,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palantir shares have added 5.8% over the past three months as the S&amp;amp;P 500 SPX, -0.35% has gained 5.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m invested in almost all of the ARK funds.  But I don&amp;#39;t like that some companies that don&amp;#39;t belong, are traded in the funds anyway.  I noticed Netflix was one of the first companies purchased into ARKX when it debuted this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I gather, a $148 million offshore bond payment due &amp;quot;today&amp;quot; still hasn&amp;#39;t been paid, triggering formal bankruptcy proceedings against the company.  I believe that the deadline was midnight in China timezone, and the press release was filed right around there. We cannot know for sure if a last-hour payment was made. But if this is all true , it could have some pretty strong short term shocks for the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now treat this with a grain of salt until more verification and information. Either way, buckle up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices were 6.2% higher in October than a year ago. That&amp;#39;s the sharpest increase since November of 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price increases were widespread, with energy, shelter, food and vehicles all costing more. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices were up 4.6%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the upward pressure on prices is the result of a mismatch between booming demand and limited supply, as businesses struggle to find both parts and workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many employers have increased pay in order to attract more workers. But growing paychecks have quickly been eroded by the rising cost of gas and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For families, they&amp;#39;re feeling it right now,&amp;quot; says Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. &amp;quot;If you got to a grocery store, you buy food that you usually buy, you then fill your gas tank on the way home so you can go to work or take your kids to school, you&amp;#39;re feeling this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When you then look at the winter coming and you realize your fuel bill for heating your home is going to rise as the winter comes, you&amp;#39;re nervous,&amp;quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q3 earnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solid quarter. Stocks dropped in the premarket, which is reasonable, the price was at an all time high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q3 revenue up 43% year-over-year, exceeding expectations; company raises guidance. Still operating at a 6c loss per share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They continue to heavily invest into the future and creating a lock-in effect with their customer base. Lots of acquisitions and more R&amp;amp;D expenditure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re building a substantial ecosystem and are well positioned as a top player for some of the biggest buzzwords of the next decade, the metaverse, gaming, augmented- and virtual reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current price is high considering fundamentals. But in my opinion, it&amp;#39;s still being slept on. I have a gut feeling this will become a hype stock within 2-3 years, so I&amp;#39;ll continue to buy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d personally be very happy with buying below $120. But I think ~$135 is probably a more reasonable entry point in the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
