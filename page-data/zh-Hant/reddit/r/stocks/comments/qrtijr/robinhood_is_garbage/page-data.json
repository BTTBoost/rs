For those of you who don’t already know, or who were not affected by it, I woke up this morning (on my first day of a 4 day weekend). Checked my portfolio after seeing my biggest position was up 5.2%. A great feeling! I logged in and saw all my options moved from out of to in the money, and I was up a couple hundred on my shares.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood did not update my portfolio balance and I figured it was bad WiFi. I switched to LTE. Same thing. Then I was hit with an unexpected error message, so I restarted the app. Then, I get told I could not log in. With the recent hacks, I became nervous. I did a web search and found that “several users were experiencing problems with login preventing them from logging into their account”. One hour later, I log back in to see that the moment I was checking my account I was up $2,000 and was now up $500. I love the Robinhood interface and commission free trades but damn. That was the last straw</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qrtijr/robinhood_is_garbage/","title":"Robinhood is GARBAGE","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T20:31:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 20:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qrtijr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qrtijr/robinhood_is_garbage/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qrtijr/robinhood_is_garbage/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"mike_the_bogatyr","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mike_the_bogatyr","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mike_the_bogatyr","score":47,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロビンフッドはGARBAGE","the_new_excerpt":"今日はまたしてもRobinhoodの不具合でがっかりしました。まだ知らない人や\n知らない人や影響を受けていない人のために説明しますと、私は今朝（4連休の初日）目が覚めました。\n私は今朝（4連休の初日）に起きました。自分のポートフォリオをチェックしてみると\n私の最大のポジションは5.2%上昇していました。最高の気分です。ログインしてみると...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"罗宾汉是垃圾","the_new_excerpt":"今天，我又一次被Robinhood的另一个故障所击倒。对于那些\n的人，或者没有受到影响的人，我今天醒来时\n上午（在我4天周末的第一天）。检查了我的投资组合后看到\n我最大的头寸上涨了5.2%。一种伟大的感觉! 我登录了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"羅賓漢是垃圾","the_new_excerpt":"今天，我又一次被Robinhood的另一個故障所擊倒。對於那些\n的人，或者沒有受到影響的人，我今天醒來時\n上午（在我4天週末的第一天）。檢查了我的投資組合後看到\n我最大的頭寸上漲了5.2%。一種偉大的感覺! 我登錄了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qrl1c1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrl1c1/wish_bagholders_are_the_mlm_huns_of_this/","title":"$Wish bagholders are the MLM huns of this subreddit now.","date":"November 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$Wishの袋持ちは、今やこのsubredditのMLMの狩人です。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"愿望袋持有者现在是这个分论坛的传销猎手。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"願望袋持有者現在是這個分論壇的傳銷獵手。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qrsr4o","excerpt":"Was chatting with my retired parent who told me they were up 70k this year in\nIRA worth a total of 375k - 400k but position is 100% Large Cap fund.\n\nParent is retired and receiving deceased spouses pension.
