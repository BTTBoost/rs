outlets,business channels,pundits,economists always try every day to say why the market moved like it did on any given day.instead of just saying the truth......we havent got a clue......they are paid to make up some reason.its like why the gas price goes up and down,its oil prices,its supply constraints,its over supply,its the weather.taxes,war,shut down oil rigs,hurricane coming,its travel season,its not travel season ,its winter,oh it summer.\nsame with stocks,covid,reopening fears,cases up,down,intrest rates ,yeilds,dollar,Powell opened his mouth,rotation,volitility,the vix.then when the thing like bond yeilds starts to drop like today from 1.68 to 1.60 stocks fall.well that shouldnt have happened according to fridays reason for rising up.well then its Germany going into lock down today....oh didnt ltaly,spain and the netherlands do that on friday?that didnt matter on friday,yeilds did.now today yeilds dont matter its that Germany shut down,\nface it dont listen or try to pick out patterns,and definitely dont think because what dropped or raised the market yesterday will do the same tomorrow.\nITS BUY AND HOLD AND SELL WHEN YOU NEED IT IN RETIREMENT.\nthe only true statement is\nITS NOT TIMING THE MARKET ITS TIME IN THE MARKET.\nlive by that rule and you wont loose..........well hopefully</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
