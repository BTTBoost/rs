Sometime in March, I had called vanguard and asked for an update. The guy told me that “no news is good news.” So, I waited. In May, I reached out to NYL and asked what was going on on their side. They looked into and said that Vanguard filled out the paperwork incorrectly. I reached back out to Vanguard and they supposedly corrected the issues and we were on our way to getting the accounts transferred. So, I waited. Well, I just checked and see that the Roth has been transferred to vanguard as of June but the IRA is still with NYL and they said that they have no transfer request paperwork from Vanguard for it. I spent 2.5 hours yesterday on hold with Vanguard trying to talk to someone. Finally, I am able to talk to someone (in the wrong department) who told me that they were super busy since they were closed on Monday for the holiday and to call back on Friday because wait times shouldn’t be as bad then. I tried calling the number he gave me, this morning but again was on hold for 20 minutes and had to hang up. \nMy question is: do I continue to put up with this BS from Vanguard and get the IRA transferred over? Should I move the IRA to Fidelity and leave the Roth with Vanguard? Should I move everything to Fidelity? \nI am super annoyed about the situation because it shouldn’t take 5 months to do this. TIA.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ofrpft/vanguards_customer_service_is_letting_down_what/","title":"Vanguard’s customer service is letting down.
