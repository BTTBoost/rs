Otherwise you won&#39;t be able to change the tickers or sort.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XL83iO7_wMi8zpw0NhsDY_p5RJ2ABsPZHitPHoqJKqA/edit?usp=drivesdk\">Market Monitor Tool</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/110fsEIyDqY-ZyQarWD2l8-8wW_R4y5IahjlclZrT2k0/edit?usp=drivesdk\">ETFdb Tool</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/149LL-4Bwf3S1r-1kWtS4vcmHAyf06MZ_JE9fSXnZ8hc/edit?usp=drivesdk\">IMPORT Tool</a></p>\n\n<p>Each tab has more information on how to use it.  In general, change the ticker or add a new row and autofill from the previous row to pull data.  Since GoogleFinance can get bogged down with too many formulas at once, keep the cells that aren&#39;t necessary right now empty and then autofill as needed. </p>\n\n<p>These tools are NOT the typical portfolio trackers to keep track of gains or dividends.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the objective was to make two pain points easier to manage: comparing price returns of every segment of the market in a consolidated format that is easy to sort, and comparing ETF characteristics to differentiate funds quickly and avoid switching between URLs / copy-pasting gymnastics.</p>\n\n<p>The Market Monitor Tool is the main spreadsheet in this tool kit:\n* I use the <strong>Overview</strong> tab to get up to date returns over all time periods for every part of the equity markets to know what&#39;s happening in terms of market rotation, sector strength, short term trading momentum, mid term tactical positioning, and long term portfolio rebalancing. Sorting the columns lets me see immediately, for example, which sector did the best today, how much small caps outperformed large caps over the past quarter, the performance of tech vs discretionary over 365 days 2 years ago, how well defensive stocks held up 4 quarters ago, current drawdown percentage for every sector from the past year&#39;s high, how much QQQ has outperformed SPY over the past 3 5 10 years, are cyclical sectors outperforming sensitive sectors over the past 6 mo, etc. &amp; etc. Every time period is conditionally formatted so colors indicate outperformance and underperformance. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The <strong>Watchlist</strong> tab has the same format except it also includes technical data like 50 SMA, RSI, volatility, and beta. Any combination of stocks and ETFs can be entered and changed here, whereas the Overview tab is meant to be a permanent list and focused on the market as a whole.  There are also Performance and Technical tabs that separate the two groups of formulas for a smaller, more manageable matrix. (the tickers are not linked between lists) </p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, the <strong>ETF Comparison</strong> tab is very handy for comparing specific characteristics between ETFs.  Most of the data here is scraped from ETF Research Center.  Info on holdings, country distribution, ETF overlap, and more is right at your fingertips.  Honestly, I&#39;d rather use this tool than the website because all of the information is on one page for multiple funds! </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <strong>ETFdb Tool</strong> has information scraped from ETFdb.com:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It has many different tabs with data on groups of ETFs in different market segments such as size, sector, industry, region, bonds, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most uniquely, it shows the average fund flows in 3 months for each group of funds, as well as things like average yield, average ER, and 3 month return.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is also a tab to pull the top 25 ETFs by AUM in any category you choose, in a complete table of fund statistics, which can be copy pasted and sorted.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use this tool to get a big picture of the ETF market and then drill down into specific funds with the ETF Comparison tab in the Market Monitor Tool.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, the <strong>Import Tool</strong> is a cheatsheet for the IMPORTHTML function used to scrape info from websites.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Shows table numbers and the data retrieved.</p></li>\n<li><p>This can help anyone create their own modifications or make sense of the formulas in the other tools.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That&#39;s it!  Let me know if you have any comments, suggestions, questions - - especially if a formula isn&#39;t correct. Sorry for wall of text! ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>\n\n<p><em>tldr: make a copy of spreadsheets and profit</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lssgyg/heres_my_googlefinance_market_monitor_and_etf/","title":"Here's my GoogleFinance Market Monitor and ETF Comparison Tools made in Google Sheets","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T09:15:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 09:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c6192ccb-9fdc-50d1-a0b9-e765b5617c24","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lssgyg/heres_my_googlefinance_market_monitor_and_etf/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lssgyg/heres_my_googlefinance_market_monitor_and_etf/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"F-O-R-T-U-N-E-X","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/F-O-R-T-U-N-E-X","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"F-O-R-T-U-N-E-X","score":2043,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"这是我用Google Sheets制作的GoogleFinance市场监测和ETF比较工具。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我想分享一下我在Google Sheets中制作的几个电子表格，你可能会\n发现有用的。\n\n要使用，请按照链接，在自己的驱动器上创建一个表的副本。\n否则，你将无法更改行情或排序。\n\n市场监测...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這是我用Google Sheets製作的GoogleFinance市場監測和ETF比較工具。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我想分享一下我在Google Sheets中製作的幾個電子表格，你可能會\n發現有用的。\n\n要使用，請按照鏈接，在自己的驅動器上創建一個表的副本。\n否則，你將無法更改行情或排序。\n\n市場監測...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cd0e68d6-a2c4-519e-97db-d8f7039b4951","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsol76/finally_an_honest_investigative_news_report_the/","title":"Finally an Honest Investigative News Report - “The GameStop Mess Exposes the Naked Short Selling Scam”","date":"February 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"终于有了一份诚实的调查性新闻报道--\"游戏机乱象揭秘裸卖空骗局\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"終於有了一份誠實的調查性新聞報道--\"遊戲機亂象揭祕裸賣空騙局\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-456f6c17-29c4-56df-a824-7093d606ad8f","excerpt":"The Mush Rush - A Play on Psychedelics\n\n8 days ago, MindMed Reached Agreement to Acquire HealthMode, a Leading Machine\nLearning Digital Medicine Company\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mindmed-reaches-agreement-to-acquire-healthmode-a-leading-machine-learning-digital-medicine-company…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsskya/the_shroom_boom_a_play_on_psychedelics_mindmed/","title":"The Shroom Boom —> A Play on Psychedelics - MindMed ($MMEDF)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 26, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"The Shroom Boom -> A Play on Psychedelics - MindMed ($MMEDF)","the_new_excerpt":"蘑菇狂潮--玩转迷幻药。\n\n8天前，MindMed达成协议，收购领先机器HealthMode。\n学习型数字医学公司\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mindmed-reaches-agreement-to-acquire-healthmode-a-leading-machine-learning-digital-medicine-company...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"The Shroom Boom -> A Play on Psychedelics - MindMed ($MMEDF)","the_new_excerpt":"蘑菇狂潮--玩轉迷幻藥。\n\n8天前，MindMed達成協議，收購領先機器HealthMode。\n學習型數字醫學公司\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mindmed-reaches-agreement-to-acquire-healthmode-a-leading-machine-learning-digital-medicine-company...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-c6192ccb-9fdc-50d1-a0b9-e765b5617c24","previousId":"RedditPost-cd0e68d6-a2c4-519e-97db-d8f7039b4951","nextId":"RedditPost-456f6c17-29c4-56df-a824-7093d606ad8f","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lssgyg/heres_my_googlefinance_market_monitor_and_etf/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
