The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May&#39;s payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. </p>\n\n<p>Last week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. </p>\n\n<p>Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we&#39;re thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.</p>\n\n<p>The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS&#39;s Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be &quot;need to be revised higher.&quot; </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook (FB) stock surged after a judge dismissed federal antitrust lawsuits and most of the ones filed by individual states. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington granted the social-media giant&#39;s requests to dismiss lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general in December.</li>\n<li>Walt Disney Co&#39;s cruise division said on Monday it is postponing its first test cruise from a U.S. port after a few volunteers showed &quot;inconsistent&quot; test results for COVID-19.</li>\n<li>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said it has taken a 40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a full-service Brazilian digital bank. Terms of the transaction were not publicly disclosed, as far as I can see. </li>\n<li>- United Airlines was putting the finishing touches on Monday to an airplane order potentially worth $30 billion at list values for up to 270 narrowbody jets in a bid to secure a pandemic recovery at favorable prices, industry sources said. The order could include up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX and some 70 Airbus A321neo.</li>\n<li>LegalZoom, a legal services software compan, has filed with US authorities with the intent to IPO</li>\n<li>Popular donut-maker, Krispy Kreme has also filed with US authorities with the intent to IPO soon.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Accenture (ACN) target raised by Barclays from $310 to $335 at Overweight.
