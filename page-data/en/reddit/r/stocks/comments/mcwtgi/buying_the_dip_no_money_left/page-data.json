Are you holding out until this volatility passes? It seems very possible we could plunge deeper, or equally as likely to shoot back up 20% in a day. </p>\n\n<p>I’m in the edge of deciding whether to hoard cash for a few months or keep buying in until I’m broke. Indices like the NASDAQ are making moves above 1% daily yet the VIX somehow is going down. What are your plays? Any really cheap stocks that have been beaten down more than they deserve? </p>\n\n<p>I currently own AAPL, PLTR, NIO, XPENG, VACQ, ARKF, ARKG and am down significantly. Sure the recovery stocks may have a 10% upside at the moment but long term, they are stagnant and can’t expect much growth from them if they don’t drastically change their business plans.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mcwtgi/buying_the_dip_no_money_left/","title":"Buying the dip, no money left","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T14:25:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 14:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6d1e129d-8e06-5572-9bc1-349cc7c99369","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mcwtgi/buying_the_dip_no_money_left/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mcwtgi/buying_the_dip_no_money_left/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"theepicone111","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theepicone111","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"theepicone111","score":398,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"买完了蘸料，没钱了","the_new_excerpt":"我相信我们很多人都处于这样的境地，我们在一些人的身上降了5、10、20、30%。\n但我们想买入跌停板。你知道，如果你买了跌停板，你就会。\n又有一个月没有闲钱了。\n\n我盯上了特斯拉，我没有任何的，虽然有很多的。\n其他的股票，我想进入... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"買完了蘸料，沒錢了","the_new_excerpt":"我相信我們很多人都處於這樣的境地，我們在一些人的身上降了5、10、20、30%。\n但我們想買入跌停板。你知道，如果你買了跌停板，你就會。\n又有一個月沒有閒錢了。\n\n我盯上了特斯拉，我沒有任何的，雖然有很多的。\n其他的股票，我想進入... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ba77e48a-f644-53be-8ca6-4d40b6613c7f","excerpt":"So I was reading post after post and comment after comment that the stimulus\nchecks were supposed to boost the market.
