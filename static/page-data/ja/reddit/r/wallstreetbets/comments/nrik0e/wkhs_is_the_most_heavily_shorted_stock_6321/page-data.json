It still is there but has decreased and that&#39;s why I think we&#39;ve seen momentum change.</p>\n\n<p>Today, AMC took a massive hit due to the company offering nearly 12 million stocks for purchase which hurt many peoples wins and likely some that hasn&#39;t invested sooner. \nEdit: this above paragraph apparently is inaccurate, it was misinformation posted on a news article today that was misleading. Apparently there was no selloff.\nEdit 2: renig here. Apparently it is confirmed that the 11.5millipn shares were selling today, which naturally would&#39;ve contributed to the amc sell off. Multiple news outlets I&#39;ve found state the same not referencing any April date. This is a discussion post.
