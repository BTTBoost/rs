They&#39;re one of many ways to find what&#39;s called &quot;resistance&quot; and &quot;support&quot; on a stock -- you can use moving averages or bollinger bands or 100 other things, but it&#39;s all going to give you the same thing: a bunch of lines on a stock chart that the price will bounce between.</p>\n\n<p>You can see that the stock market goes up and up and up until it can&#39;t take it anymore -- then it goes down. But when it goes down -- unless something really bad happens -- it always goes down to either the middle line or the bottom line, then it bounces right back up again.</p>\n\n<p>There is no bad news today. The market is just bouncing like it normally does.</p>\n\n<p>The market is going to keep dropping until QQQ reaches about $325.48 a share. Then it&#39;s going to bounce right back up to where it was keep climbing into new highs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/llykgt/why_you_shouldnt_panic_about_todays_dip/","title":"Why you shouldn't panic about today's dip","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T17:37:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 17:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3c71e4de-35c5-5136-ad06-f9305ba8a1c2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llykgt/why_you_shouldnt_panic_about_todays_dip/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llykgt/why_you_shouldnt_panic_about_todays_dip/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"takenorinvalid","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/takenorinvalid","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"takenorinvalid","score":1179,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么你不应该对今天的跌势感到恐慌？","the_new_excerpt":"今天的事情很红，很多新的投资者都吓坏了吧。\n现在，所以我认为值得解释的是，这是完全正常的。\n\n股票从来没有火箭直达月球 -- 他们在途中上下颠簸。\n而且，当你有一个红色的一天，像今天， 有办法预测当... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼你不應該對今天的跌勢感到恐慌？","the_new_excerpt":"今天的事情很紅，很多新的投資者都嚇壞了吧。\n現在，所以我認爲值得解釋的是，這是完全正常的。\n\n股票從來沒有火箭直達月球 -- 他們在途中上下顛簸。\n而且，當你有一個紅色的一天，像今天， 有辦法預測當... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2747e8eb-27d5-55f6-a699-ad83e2a8b71c","excerpt":"Good morning investors & traders!
