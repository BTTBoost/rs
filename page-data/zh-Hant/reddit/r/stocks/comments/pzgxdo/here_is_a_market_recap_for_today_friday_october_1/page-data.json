Stocks advanced today, reversing hard in the morning to the upside, though all three major indexes closed out the week negative once again. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.19% higher but finished the week -1.86% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) continued its streak of underperformance, pressured by rising Treasury yields, closing the day 0.51% higher but finished the week -2.71%, one of the worst weeks all year. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day 1.45% higher, driven by strength in financial and energy stocks, but closed the week 1.37% down. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day 1.68% higher but the week -0.38% down.</p>\n\n<p>Market participants continue to closely monitor developments coming out of Washington DC, with Congress managing to avoid a government shutdown by passing a last-minute bill yesterday night.  Right before the midnight deadline, President Biden signed into law a short-term appropriations bill that will keep the government running through at least December 3, successfully avoiding a government shutdown. The Senate and House approved the funding legislation earlier Thursday. The Senate passed it in a 65-35 vote as all 50 Democrats backed it and 15 Republicans joined them. The House passed the bill by a 254-175 margin. Every Democratic representative and 34 Republicans supported it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/government-shutdown-congress-moves-to-pass-funding-bill.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/government-shutdown-congress-moves-to-pass-funding-bill.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Focus will now shift towards debates surrounding the bipartisan infrastructure bill and raising the debt ceiling before mid-October, which is the estimated timeline when the debt ceiling will be hit. Earlier today, President Biden went to the capital to try and salvage plans for the infrastructure bill after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to delay the vote she scheduled today. This is due to disagreements in the party between moderates and more progressive members, particularly with Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who oppose the size of the infrastructure bill. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-struggle-reach-deal-congress-bidens-agenda-2021-10-01/\">https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-struggle-reach-deal-congress-bidens-agenda-2021-10-01/</a></p>\n\n<p>A historic U.S. debt default could occur around Oct. 18, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has estimated, if Congress fails to give the government additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of $28.4 trillion. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it &quot;as early as next week,&quot; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. </p>\n\n<p>Put simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moody’s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. “Internationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline”</p>\n\n<p>The report goes on to say, “Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government’s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.”</p>\n\n<p>Here is a link to the full report, I encourage you to read it</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf\">https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>This is huge! Merck (MRK) said it developed an oral drug that reduces the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by around 50% for patients with mild or moderate cases of coronavirus and has filed for emergency use authorization with the FDA. Might be start time to look again at travel and restaurant stocks, a pill/oral drug would go a huge way to make people more comfortable and help make up for the gap created by vaccine hesitancy. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/merck-to-seek-emergency-authorization-for-oral-covid-19-treatment.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/merck-to-seek-emergency-authorization-for-oral-covid-19-treatment.html</a></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.&quot;</em> -Eleanor Roosevelt</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzgxdo/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_october_1/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 1, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-02T02:03:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-02 02:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pzgxdo","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzgxdo/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_october_1/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzgxdo/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_october_1/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本日2021年10月1日（金）のマーケット・リカップをご紹介します。","the_new_excerpt":"サイコ・マーケット・レビュー - 2021年10月1日（金\n\nHappy spooky season Psychos! 今日の株価は、午前中に大きく反転して上昇した。\nしかし、主要3指数は再びマイナスで週を終えた。\n再びマイナスになってしまった。S&P 500 (SPY)は1.19%上昇して終了しましたが、週の終わりには\n-1.86%の下落となりました。ナスダックは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"以下是今天（2021年10月1日，星期五）的市场回顾","the_new_excerpt":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年10月1日，星期五\n\n幽灵季节快乐，精神病患者! 今天股市上涨，在上午的时候猛烈反转。\n涨，尽管所有三个主要指数都在本周收盘时再次出现负值。\n再次出现负值。标准普尔500指数（SPY）收盘上涨1.19%，但本周收盘时\n-1.86%的跌幅。纳斯达克指数...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是今天（2021年10月1日，星期五）的市場回顧","the_new_excerpt":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年10月1日，星期五\n\n幽靈季節快樂，精神病患者! 今天股市上漲，在上午的時候猛烈反轉。\n漲，儘管所有三個主要指數都在本週收盤時再次出現負值。\n再次出現負值。標準普爾500指數（SPY）收盤上漲1.19%，但本週收盤時\n-1.86%的跌幅。納斯達克指數...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pzj09r","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzj09r/they_used_to_be/","title":"They used to be","date":"October 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"彼らは以前は","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"他们曾经是","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"他們曾經是","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1443988833784184844","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1443988833784184844","title":"Here's an unwelcome October surprise from USPS: starting today, the delivery times for some first class mail will be a couple of days longer. \n\nAnd the Postal Service's holiday season price hikes start kicking in on Monday. https://t.co/FzExHfL0nj","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 02, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"本日より、一部のファーストクラス郵便の配達日数が2、3日長くなります。\n\nまた、郵便局のホリデーシーズンの値上げは、月曜日から始まります。https://t.co/FzExHfL0nj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"这里有一个来自美国邮政的不受欢迎的十月惊喜：从今天开始，一些头等舱邮件的交付时间将延长几天。\n\n而邮政服务的假日季节价格上涨从周一开始生效。https://t.co/FzExHfL0nj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"這裏有一個來自美國郵政的不受歡迎的十月驚喜：從今天開始，一些頭等艙郵件的交付時間將延長几天。\n\n而郵政服務的假日季節價格上漲從週一開始生效。https://t.co/FzExHfL0nj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pzgxdo","previousId":"RedditPost-pzj09r","nextId":"TweetPost-1443988833784184844","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzgxdo/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_october_1/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
