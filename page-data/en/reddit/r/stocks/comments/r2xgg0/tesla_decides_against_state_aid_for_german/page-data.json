For some reason, governments don’t want to do that...,&quot; Musk added, deviating from the subject of the factory grant.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla itself is investing 5 billion euros in the battery plant, according to German economy ministry estimates.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, construction of a car production site alongside the battery plant, which Tesla has begun building under pre-approval permits while it awaits final approval from the regional government, has made good progress in the last few weeks, a spokesperson for the federal economy ministry said.</p>\n\n<p>The electric vehicle maker also applied in November 2020 for regional funding from Brandenburg, according to the regional government&#39;s website.</p>\n\n<p>A Brandenburg economy ministry spokesperson said this application had not been withdrawn.</p>\n\n<p>The amount Tesla applied for is undisclosed, but investments worth over 100 million euros are generally given 6.8% of their value, the website says.</p>\n\n<p>The latest round of online consultations for the public to express environmental and other concerns about the car factory and battery plant closed last week and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes to formally begin production by the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country&#39;s complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change. </p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-withdrew-state-funding-application-german-battery-plant-economy-ministry-2021-11-26/\">https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-withdrew-state-funding-application-german-battery-plant-economy-ministry-2021-11-26/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r2xgg0/tesla_decides_against_state_aid_for_german/","title":"Tesla decides against state aid for German battery plant as Musk opposes subsidies","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-27T03:52:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-27 03:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r2xgg0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r2xgg0/tesla_decides_against_state_aid_for_german/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r2xgg0/tesla_decides_against_state_aid_for_german/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Ehralur","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ehralur","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Ehralur","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Tesla社、ドイツのバッテリー工場への国庫補助を断念 Musk氏は補助金に反対","the_new_excerpt":" * Teslaは州の助成金の申請を取り下げ\n * すべての補助金を廃止すべきだ、とマスクはつぶやく\n * Car plant construction progressing well - economic ministry\n * 地域資金の申請はまだ進行中\n\nベルリン 26日 ロイター］ - テスラ(TSLA.O)は26日、国からの資金援助の申請を取り下げたと発表した。\n申請を取り下げました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"马斯克反对补贴，特斯拉决定不为德国电池厂提供国家援助","the_new_excerpt":" * 特斯拉撤回对国家资金的申请\n * 马斯克在推特上说，所有的补贴都应该被取消\n * 汽车厂建设进展顺利--经济部\n * 区域资金申请仍在进行中\n\n柏林，11月26日（路透社）--特斯拉（TSLA.O）周五表示，它已经撤回了其\n撤回申请...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"馬斯克反對補貼，特斯拉決定不爲德國電池廠提供國家援助","the_new_excerpt":" * 特斯拉撤回對國家資金的申請\n * 馬斯克在推特上說，所有的補貼都應該被取消\n * 汽車廠建設進展順利--經濟部\n * 區域資金申請仍在進行中\n\n柏林，11月26日（路透社）--特斯拉（TSLA.O）週五表示，它已經撤回了其\n撤回申請...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1464429941706182667","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1464429941706182667","title":"RT @DefiantLs: https://t.co/WYYPr7IR71","date":"November 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @DefiantLs: https://t.co/WYYPr7IR71","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"https://t.co/WYYPr7IR71"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @DefiantLs: https://t.co/WYYPr7IR71","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"https://t.co/WYYPr7IR71"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @DefiantLs: https://t.co/WYYPr7IR71","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"https://t.co/WYYPr7IR71"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-r2xgg0","previousId":"TweetPost-1464429941706182667","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r2xgg0/tesla_decides_against_state_aid_for_german/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
