It&#39;s NOTHING, compared to timeframes we seen on WSB so far and you still can&#39;t get your ass up and fucking HOLD and believe in what we want to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>When the stonk blew, we couldn&#39;t stop the posts and memes about how GME is going to moon and everybody was circlejerking, but as soon as some retards on wallstreet spread lies and change rules, you hush and start being nervous and SELL. WHAT IS WORNG WITH YOU RETARDS? They got EXACTLY what they wanted. And you know what the worst part is?</p>\n\n<p><strong>YOU RETARDS EVEN TOLD US THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Did you think that the hedge funds would just run away in fear and loose their face AND money? Didn&#39;t you think they&#39;d fight with dirty moves and get away with it? Haven&#39;t you learned from 2008?</p>\n\n<p>Face it! We&#39;re apes. And now we&#39;re not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270€ for 2k€, because I have debts of 10k€ and a lawsuit going against me. I can&#39;t afford to pay back anymore because COVID made me loose my job. I&#39;m basically fucked and don&#39;t know what to do and stand with my back at the wall. But guess what?</p>\n\n<p><strong>I STILL HOLD.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t about money anymore. This isn&#39;t about saving before shit goes down. This isn&#39;t about believe that the squeeze will come.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is because I believe in you retards and I want wallstreet to bleed for what they did.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And so should you! Stop whining, stop getting in doubt.</p>\n\n<p>For ONE fucking time in your life - just do <strong>NOTHING</strong> and <strong>HOLD</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>WSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is. And if they played by the rules, we&#39;d have fucked them in a very autistic and ironic way. But guess what.
