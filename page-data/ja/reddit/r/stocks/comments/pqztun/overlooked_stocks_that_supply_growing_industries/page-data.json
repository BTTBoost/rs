Not to mention, you&#39;re more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus one of the many small cap companies looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars or semiconductors, the hype has already consumed supply stocks such as lithium battery stocks.</p>\n\n<p>This discussion is primarily inspired by <a href=\"/u/Thereian\">/u/Thereian</a>&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/om9772/what_are_your_underappreciated_offtheradar_picks/h5kxnlz/\">comment</a> describing these kind of stock picks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid. And all of the investment that Intel and Taiwan Semi are making to build billions of dollars worth of FABs? Yeah, Entegris will get their chunk of that money. They sell the equipment upfront and the consumables going forward. Truly a fantastic company, I&#39;ve owned since 2009 and am still completely bullish.</p>\n\n<p>TMO - Similar to the above philosophy. Lots of expensive cell and gene therapy companies out there, those are high risk. But there&#39;s a low-risk high-reward play: Thermo Fisher. Just like ENTG in the example above, Thermo is a supplier to the whole industry. While those biotechs remain unprofitable, the suppliers are getting paid and Thermo is making absolute bank in a rapid growth industry and yet it trades at a PE of 20...absurd. It&#39;ll double or triple in a couple years.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m an engineer focused on raw materials, so I&#39;m a bit biased but I have seen suppliers make money hand over fist while the companies buying these things are burning cash or barely scraping by. Thats what drove me to look in to high-moat suppliers in the first place and I will continue to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other tickers mentioned in the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pp6gfl/lesserknown_stocks_that_supply_popular_industries/\">previous thread</a> for this topic include:</p>\n\n<p><strong>$ILMN:</strong> Provides tools for genomics work. Seems to have a high P/E and is a bit of a popular genomic play, though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>$LEA and $ADNT:</strong> Auto parts suppliers. Pretty cyclical industry and unstable charts, however.</p>\n\n<p><strong>URI</strong>: United Rentals, construction equipment rentals. Might benefit from infrastructure spending. Not exactly what we think of as supply but I&#39;ll leave it here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>$SWKS:</strong> Semiconductor supply picks are popular but this one was mentioned the most as people believe it to be undervalued.</p>\n\n<p><strong>$MTRN:</strong> Metals company involved in parts for &quot;EV, space, and renewables.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>$CDW:</strong> Provider of IT programs for business, government, and education. Again, not exactly supply but it was mentioned and piqued my interest.</p>\n\n<p>What do you all think of this investment strategy? Are any of these stocks on your radar? What else would you add?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pqztun/overlooked_stocks_that_supply_growing_industries/","title":"Overlooked stocks that supply growing industries","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-19T06:38:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-19 06:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pqztun","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pqztun/overlooked_stocks_that_supply_growing_industries/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pqztun/overlooked_stocks_that_supply_growing_industries/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"AristotleKarataev","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AristotleKarataev","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"AristotleKarataev","score":117,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"成長産業を供給する見過ごされている銘柄","the_new_excerpt":"このスレッドの更新版を再投稿します。\n\nゲノムや半導体、自動車など、人気のある業界では誇大広告が多く見られます。\n自動車のような人気のある産業では、誇大広告がよく見られますが、これらの誇大広告された銘柄は、しばしば恐ろしく過大評価されてしまいます。\n\n成長している人気のある産業に投資するもう一つの方法は、次のようなものです。\nを生産している企業に投資することです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"供应成长型产业的被忽视的股票","the_new_excerpt":"转贴这个主题的更新版本。\n\n我们看到很多围绕流行产业的炒作，如基因组学、半导体、或汽车。\n汽车等热门行业，而这些被炒作的股票最终往往被高估得吓人。\n\n投资于成长中和被炒作的行业的另一种方法是投资于\n生产的公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"供應成長型產業的被忽視的股票","the_new_excerpt":"轉貼這個主題的更新版本。\n\n我們看到很多圍繞流行產業的炒作，如基因組學、半導體、或汽車。\n汽車等熱門行業，而這些被炒作的股票最終往往被高估得嚇人。\n\n投資於成長中和被炒作的行業的另一種方法是投資於\n生產的公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pql21r","excerpt":"Is there any advice on this ?","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pql21r/best_bogleheads_alternative_investments_not/","title":"Best Bogleheads alternative investments, not related to market ?
