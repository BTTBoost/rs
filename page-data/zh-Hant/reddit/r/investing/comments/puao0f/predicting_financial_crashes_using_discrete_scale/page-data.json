Here, “log-periodicity” refers to a sequence of oscillations with progressively shorter cycles of a period decaying according to a geometrical series.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, extensive statistical tests have been performed [Johansen et al., 2000, Johansen, 1997] to show that the reported “logperiodic” structures essentially never occurred in ≈ 105 years of synthetic trading following a “classical” time-series model, the GARCH(1,1) model with student-t statistics, often used as a benchmark in academic circles as well as by practitioners. Thus, the null hypothesis that log-periodicity could result simply from random fluctuations is strongly rejected</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>We have presented a synthesis of the available empirical evidence in the light of recent theoretical developments for the existence of characteristic log-periodic signatures of growing bubbles in a variety of stock markets as well as currencies.</p>\n\n<p>We have here documented 8 unrelated crashes from 1929 to 1998, on stock markets as diverse as the US, Hong-Kong or the Russian market and on currencies.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, we have discovered a significant bubble on Wall Street ending in 1962 [Johansen et al., 2000] as well as “anti-bubbles”on the Nikkei since 1990 and the Gold (after the 1980 bubble maximum) [Johansen and Sornette, 1999c].</p>\n\n<p>Quite unexpectedly, we have shown that the Russian bubble crashing 14 in Aug. 1997 had close to identical power law and log-periodic behaviour to the bubbles observed on Wall Street, the Hong-Kong stock market and on currencies.</p>\n\n<p>To our knowledge, no major financial crash preceded by an extended bubble has occurred in the past 2 decades without exhibit a logperiodic signature.</p>\n\n<p>In this context, note that the novel analysis of the Russian index presented here was motivated by Ilinski’s claim of a crash without log-periodic signature, which we have shown to be incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>All these results, taken together with the remarkable robustness and consistency of the estimation of the exponent β as well as the more important statistics the scaling ratio λ, make the case for power law acceleration and log-periodicity very strong.</p>\n\n<p>In our opinion, one can no more ignore these very specific and strong signatures which is characteristic of developing bubbles and this calls for further investigations to unravel in more depths the underlying economical, financial and behavioural mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>These different cases, together with the 1962 “slow event” as well as the “anti-bubbles”, show that the log-periodic critical theory applies both to bubbles ending in a sudden crash as well as to bubbles landing smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>This is in fact a strong prediction of our rational model of imitative behaviour. What we have attempted here is not to explain why crashes happens or bubbles exists, but to quantify the process taking place during extended bubbles that very often lead to the rapid regime switching a crash represent. We have offered evidence that bubbles and anti-bubbles have log-periodic and power law characteristics and hence provides for a quantification of extended “moods” on the markets.</p>\n\n<p>We have furthermore, provided a model which contains the observed signatures. Whether, as proposed, discrete scale invariance or some other mechanisms [Sornette, 1998] are responsible for the prominent log-periodic signatures observed, only a more detailed microscopic model can answer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/puao0f/predicting_financial_crashes_using_discrete_scale/","title":"Predicting Financial Crashes Using Discrete Scale Invariance [Research paper]","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-24T09:46:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-24 09:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"puao0f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/puao0f/predicting_financial_crashes_using_discrete_scale/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/puao0f/predicting_financial_crashes_using_discrete_scale/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"HoleyProfit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"HoleyProfit","score":77,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"離散尺度不変性を用いた金融クラッシュの予測【研究論文","the_new_excerpt":"全文はこちら - arXiv:cond-mat/9903321v3 8 Jun 1999\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9903321.pdf]\n\nはじめに\n\n最近の2つの論文[Johansen and Sornette, 1999a, Johansen et al., 2000]では\n1929年10月、1987年10月、香港1987年10月のクラッシュ、1998年8月の\n衝突、1998年8月の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"利用离散尺度不变性预测金融风暴[研究论文] 。","the_new_excerpt":"在此阅读全文 - arXiv:cond-mat/9903321v3 1999年6月8日\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9903321.pdf]\n\n简介\n\n最近的两篇论文[Johansen and Sornette, 1999a, Johansen et al.\n提出了关于1929年10月、1987年10月、香港1987年10月崩溃的越来越多的证据。\n崩溃，以及1998年8月的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"利用離散尺度不變性預測金融風暴[研究論文] 。","the_new_excerpt":"在此閱讀全文 - arXiv:cond-mat/9903321v3 1999年6月8日\n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9903321.pdf]\n\n簡介\n\n最近的兩篇論文[Johansen and Sornette, 1999a, Johansen et al.\n提出了關於1929年10月、1987年10月、香港1987年10月崩潰的越來越多的證據。\n崩潰，以及1998年8月的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1441144741207298048","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1441144741207298048","title":"Commodity prices over the last year...\nHeating Oil: +101%\nGasoline: +84%\nWTI Crude: +84%\nNatural Gas: +81%\nBrent Crude +79%\nCoffee: +67%\nAluminum: +67%\nSugar: +45%\nCorn: +44%\nCopper: +41%\nCotton: +39%\nWheat: +31%\nSoybeans: +27%\nLumber: +17%\nSilver: -2%\nGold: -6%\nPalladium: -13%","date":"September 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"過去1年間のコモディティ価格...\nヒーティング・オイル +101%\nガソリンスタンド +84%\nWTI原油: +84\n天然ガス +81%\nブレント原油： +79\nコーヒー +67%\nアルミニウム +67%\n砂糖： +45 +45%\nトウモロコシ: +45 +44%\n銅: +41 +41%\n綿: +41 +39%\n小麦 +31%\n大豆 +27%\n材木: +17 +17%\n銀：2%増\n金：6%減\nパラジウム：13%減","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"过去一年的商品价格...\n取暖油。+101%\n汽油。+84%\nWTI原油: +84%\n天然气: +81%\n布伦特原油: +79\n咖啡。+67%\n铝。+67%\n糖: +45%\n玉米: +44%\n铜。+41%\n棉花。+39%\n小麦: +31%\n大豆: +27%\n木材: +17%\n白银：-2%。\n黄金：-6\n钯金：-13","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"過去一年的商品價格...\n取暖油。+101%\n汽油。+84%\nWTI原油: +84%\n天然氣: +81%\n布倫特原油: +79\n咖啡。+67%\n鋁。+67%\n糖: +45%\n玉米: +44%\n銅。+41%\n棉花。+39%\n小麥: +31%\n大豆: +27%\n木材: +17%\n白銀：-2%。\n黃金：-6\n鈀金：-13","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pubafu","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pubafu/we_finally_did_it_boys_we_got_blackberry_to/","title":"We finally did it boys, we got BlackBerry to officially Acknowledge BBto1000","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 24, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ついにやりました、BlackBerryにBBto1000を認めさせました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们终于做到了，孩子们，我们让黑莓正式承认了BBto1000。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們終於做到了，孩子們，我們讓黑莓正式承認了BBto1000。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-puao0f","previousId":"TweetPost-1441144741207298048","nextId":"RedditPost-pubafu","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/puao0f/predicting_financial_crashes_using_discrete_scale/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
