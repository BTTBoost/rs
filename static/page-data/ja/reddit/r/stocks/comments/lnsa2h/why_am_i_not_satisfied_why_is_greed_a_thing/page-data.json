At the start of GME movement I was at $31,000. After GME was over I finished with a total of $84,000 and felt depressed because I could&#39;ve sold when it was $105,000 but I was greedy. Not only that, but soon after I spent $10,000 on a very stupid AMC play. Then a very stupid play (Lucid) which I will not mention that got me down to $66,000. With that $66,000. I have $20,000 sitting in NIO and $10,000 in ARKF. I&#39;ve been feeling like a piece of crap for not having made more out of these trades but then I have to realize I went from a total of $17,000 invested total to $66,000 and that&#39;s not so bad, but shit I feel so WEIRD. Mind you I make only $29,000 salary after tax right now so it would&#39;ve meant so much to cash out at $105,000.
