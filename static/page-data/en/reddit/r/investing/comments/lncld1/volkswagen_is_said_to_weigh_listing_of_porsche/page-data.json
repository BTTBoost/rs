VW could use any proceeds from a listing for acquisitions or technology investments, according to the people.</p>\n\n<p>Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess sounded the alarm in an interview with Bloomberg News last month about how Tesla Inc. and other electric-vehicle companies are cashing in on market optimism about their growth prospects. Investors have taken a dimmer view of VW and other incumbents, who will need to spend tens of billions to develop EVs while restructuring operations that revolve around combustion engines.</p>\n\n<p>VW’s preferred shares rose as much as 6% in Frankfurt trading. At about $757 billion, Tesla’s market value is roughly seven times higher than VW’s 90 billion euros ($109 billion).</p>\n\n<p>“A Volkswagen IPO of its Porsche brand would be a bold solution to generating much-needed shareholder value,” Michael Dean, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note. Porsche’s plan to be almost all-electric by 2030, with the exception of the 911 model, could “attract Tesla-like multiples while generating a Ferrari-like Ebitda margin.” &quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lncld1/volkswagen_is_said_to_weigh_listing_of_porsche/","title":"Volkswagen is said to weigh listing of Porsche sports-car division","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-19T17:54:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-19 17:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"625792d8-a47c-5c7b-b352-7500ac0d44a3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lncld1/volkswagen_is_said_to_weigh_listing_of_porsche/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lncld1/volkswagen_is_said_to_weigh_listing_of_porsche/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Responsible-Plan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Responsible-Plan","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Responsible-Plan","score":75,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"据悉，大众汽车将考虑将保时捷跑车部门上市。","the_new_excerpt":"来源 据说大众将考虑将保时捷跑车部门上市\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-said-weigh-listing-porsche-133826243.html]\n\n\"大众汽车公司正在考虑将旗下的保时捷跑车部门单独上市。\n的交易，这可能会提高其估值，并带来...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"據悉，大衆汽車將考慮將保時捷跑車部門上市。","the_new_excerpt":"來源 據說大衆將考慮將保時捷跑車部門上市\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-said-weigh-listing-porsche-133826243.html]\n\n\"大衆汽車公司正在考慮將旗下的保時捷跑車部門單獨上市。\n的交易，這可能會提高其估值，並帶來...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b3bf1f69-3d91-5379-9568-6ae6fe76f284","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lngem6/do_you_think_he_realized_it_yes_or_no/","title":"Do you think he realized it YES OR NO","date":"February 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你觉得他意识到了吗 是或不是","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你覺得他意識到了嗎 是或不是","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-922d40a7-6bff-5aa3-bd52-6df0b4aadc90","excerpt":"I recently had a kid and will open up a UGMA account for her.
