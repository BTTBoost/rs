The May 2021 CPI reported yesterday shows a 5% jump YoY in all categories with an apparently HUGE jump of 28.5 % YoY when looking at energy.</p>\n\n<p>However it seems that most people, and the media, are forgetting that 1 year ago, May 2020 was when the whole economy was depressed due to the lockdowns.  For energy in particular, in May 2020 the oil futures unprecedently went negative! </p>\n\n<p>The apparent YoY spike is actually due to a base effect, or that the denominator of your calculation is smaller than usual.  You can take a look at the 20-year monthly CPI increase here: <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>For all categories, in May 2020 the CPI YoY increase was 0.1% . To smooth over the Covid crash, we can look at the CPI increase between May 2021 and May 2019. Mathematically this is the geometric average and it comes out to what you&#39;d expect: 2.5%  . As you can see on the graph, the 2.5% YoY is actually quite average for the period of 2016-2019. This means that the current value of the CPI is roughly what we would have got had there been no covid and the usual inflation growth.</p>\n\n<p>For energy, which apparently had the huge spike, the case is even stronger that this is simply a base effect, indicating the economy is returning to normal. The YoY increase on May 2020 was -18.9%. If you take the geometric average: square root( 0.811 * 1.285) you get an average increase of ONLY 2% . I say only, because the average CPI increase over the last year has been as high as 8-9%. So 2% increase is actually close to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the take away? Inflation fears are overblown and the Fed is right to say that this is a temporary effect. We are returning to normal, it just seems much more because we&#39;ve been locked down for a year and prices were depressed due to the lockdown. In particular, I would load up on tech/growth stocks which took a hit due to rising inflation. The numbers simply don&#39;t point to the fears that we will enter a new era of high inflation.</p>\n\n<p>Tldr; inflation is not real, buy growth stocks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/nxamo1/inflation_is_actually_in_the_norm_for_the_decade/","title":"Inflation is actually in the norm for the decade","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-11T13:55:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-11 13:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"bc196857-11b8-5861-82a0-c37828102eb9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nxamo1/inflation_is_actually_in_the_norm_for_the_decade/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nxamo1/inflation_is_actually_in_the_norm_for_the_decade/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"LudovicoKM","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LudovicoKM","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"LudovicoKM","score":137,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"インフレ率は10年間で実際には標準的な値になっている","the_new_excerpt":"インフレ率が急上昇していると言われていますが、これは非常に高いものです。\n高いと言われています。昨日発表された2021年5月のCPIでは、すべての項目で前年比5％の上昇が見られました。\n中でもエネルギーについては前年比28.5%という大きな伸びを示しています。\n\nしかし、ほとんどの人、そしてメディアは、1.5％のインフレを忘れているようです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"通货膨胀实际上处于十年来的正常状态","the_new_excerpt":"有很多关于通货膨胀的讨论，据说它是如何飙升和非常高的\n高。昨天报告的2021年5月CPI显示，所有类别的CPI同比增长了5%。\n当看到能源时，显然出现了28.5%的巨大年增长率。\n\n然而，似乎大多数人和媒体都忘记了，1...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"通貨膨脹實際上處於十年來的正常狀態","the_new_excerpt":"有很多關於通貨膨脹的討論，據說它是如何飆升和非常高的\n高。昨天報告的2021年5月CPI顯示，所有類別的CPI同比增長了5%。\n當看到能源時，顯然出現了28.5%的巨大年增長率。\n\n然而，似乎大多數人和媒體都忘記了，1...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1403068910749036545","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1403068910749036545","title":"New Post:\n\nThe Ultimate Superpower in Investing...\n\nhttps://t.co/JFnwUu3TSB https://t.co/bRVvEEyjde","date":"June 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"新しい投稿です。\n\n投資における究極の超能力...\n\nhttps://t.co/JFnwUu3TSB https://t.co/bRVvEEyjde","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"新文章。\n\n投资中的终极超级力量...\n\nhttps://t.co/JFnwUu3TSB https://t.co/bRVvEEyjde","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"新文章。\n\n投資中的終極超級力量...\n\nhttps://t.co/JFnwUu3TSB https://t.co/bRVvEEyjde","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6c07c169-620c-59ec-96f3-d4ab7e86cf30","excerpt":"I found this DD originally posted by /twenty98 5 months ago.
