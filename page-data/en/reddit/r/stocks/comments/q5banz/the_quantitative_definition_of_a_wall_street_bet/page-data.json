This boundary may be described as the point at which the expected geometric growth rate of a trade becomes negative. The minimum fraction of ones available capital, <em>w</em>, needed to qualify a trade as a Wall Street Bet is found by solving the following equation for <em>w:</em></p>\n\n<p>(1+wb)<strong><sup>p</sup></strong>(1-w)<sup>1-p</sup><em>=1</em></p>\n\n<p>Every trade can be described by the following variables:</p>\n\n<p><em>r:</em> an expected geometric growth rate, expressed as a fraction of capital. For example, if one’s expected geometric growth rate is positive 12%, then r=1.12. If the trade has a negative expected geometric growth rate of -15%, then r=0.85.</p>\n\n<p><em>f:</em> the fraction of capital invested. If one commits 20% of their capital to a trade, then f = 0.2. If one is all in, f=1.</p>\n\n<p><em>b:</em> the return earned on a winning trade, as a fraction of capital committed to the trade. For example, if the odds are 2:1, and your account is up $2,000 from $1,000 risked, then b = 2.</p>\n\n<p><em>a:</em> the loss from a losing trade, as a fraction of capital committed to the trade. For example, if one loses 50% of the money they spent on a trade, a = 0.5.</p>\n\n<p><em>p:</em> the probability of a winning trade. For example, if the probability of a winning trade is 69%, then <em>p</em> = 0.69.</p>\n\n<p>The expected geometric growth rate is found by the formula: r =(1+fb)<strong><sup>p</sup></strong>(1-fa)<em><sup>1-p</sup></em></p>\n\n<p>The Wall Street gambler does not take partial losses however as they prefer to hold losing options until expiry. The loss from a losing trade, <em>a,</em> thus equals 1 as the Wall Street Bet’s losses are equal to the total portion <em>f</em> spent on the trade. The equation can thus be simplified:</p>\n\n<p>r =(1+fb)<strong><sup>p</sup></strong>(1-f)<em><sup>1-p</sup></em></p>\n\n<p>The optimal amount <em>f</em> to commit to a trade is given by the Kelly Criterion. When <em>a</em> = 1, the Kelly Criterion is <em>f = p+(p-1)/b.</em> Plotting <em>f</em> on the x axis and <em>r</em> on the y axis, the Kelly Criterion gives us the maximum possible value of expected growth rate for a given probability <em>p</em> and odds <em>b</em>. Where the curve crosses the x axis, however, the expected growth rate of the trade equals zero. For values of <em>f</em> higher than this intercept, the trade is expected to lose money. It is thus a Wall Street Bet, and not a respectable trade. (<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/39c5qH0.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/39c5qH0.jpeg</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The trade that commits more to a single trade than Kelly and gives a growth rate of <em>r &lt; 1</em> is a Wall Street Bet, and the fraction of capital <em>w</em> above which the growth rate is negative is the Wall Street Bet Criterion. For example, for a trade with a win probability of <em>p = 0.333...,</em> and payout odds of 5:1  <em>b = 5,</em> the Kelly Criterion gives a fraction <em>f</em> of 0.2, meaning a trader should commit 20% of their capital on the trade for a growth rate of <em>r=1.09</em>, which would turn $1000 into over $5 million over 100 trades on average. The Wall Street Gambler, however, would commit more than 44.2% of their available capital to the trade, ensuring that they would eventually turn their $1000 into $0. Here is a chart of some values for reference: (<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7rBGG9r.png\">https://i.imgur.com/7rBGG9r.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The formula for the Wall Street Bet Criterion is <em>(1+</em>wb)<strong><sup>p</sup></strong>(1-w)<sup>1-p</sup><em>=1.</em> Solving for <em>w</em> is not as easy as it appears. Wolfram Alpha couldn’t do it, and neither could I. For example, for <em>p=0.25, w</em> can only be simplified to algebraic gobbledy gook like <em>w ≈ -(2^(1/3) (-3 b - 1))/(3 b (-27 b^2 + 27 sqrt(b^2 + 0.518519 b + 0.111111) b - 9 b - 2)^(1/3)) + (-27 b^2 + 27 sqrt(b^2 + 0.518519 b + 0.111111) b - 9 b - 2)^(1/3)/(3 2^(1/3) b) - (1 - 3 b)/(3 b).</em> Take a look at the solution for p = 0.6: (<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/XjemjW3.png\">https://i.imgur.com/XjemjW3.png</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I hope that someone can show me a solution to the Wall Street Bets Criterion equation. In the meantime, I have found that for <em>p=0.5, w</em>  = 2 times the amount given by Kelly. The relationship between <em>p</em> and <em>w</em> appears to be polynomial and the relationship between <em>b</em> and <em>w</em> appears logarithmic.</p>\n\n<p>Less than optimal trades that still produce positive expected returns are not Wall Street Bets, they are just bad trades. If one is having difficulty turning their trade into a Wall Street Bet, there are three strategies one may pursue:</p>\n\n<p>Increase the amount committed to a trade to above the value for <em>w.</em> This is the easiest and most straightforward way to turn a trade into a Wall Street Bet. Committing 100% of one&#39;s capital to any trade where  <em>p &lt; 1</em> will safely ensure that the trade is, in fact, a Wall Street Bet. Alternatively, the aspiring Wall Street Gambler can seek to find a trade with a lower probability. Lowering the probability of a win <em>p</em> can cause one’s fraction of capital committed <em>f</em> to exceed <em>w.</em> Finally, one can attempt to lower the expected payoff <em>b</em> for a winning trade.</p>\n\n<p>A word of caution: for high probabilities, it may take more extreme measures than you might intuitively suspect to categorically declare your trade a Wall Street Bet. For example, for <em>p = 0.9</em> and the odds are a modest 1:1, <em>b= 1,</em> the amount of one’s capital that must be committed to the Wall Street Bet is over 99.8%! Any amount less than that is actually profitable in the long run and thus not a Wall Street Bet - it is merely a suboptimal trade.</p>\n\n<p>Finding the value <em>w</em> is cumbersome without a solution to the equation (1+wb)<strong><sup>p</sup></strong>(1-w)<sup>1-p</sup><em>=1 and</em> I hope that someone shares a simplified solution for <em>w.</em> Solving the equation would make it far more convenient for Wall Street Gambler to ensure that one&#39;s trades have a negative expected growth rate.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q5banz/the_quantitative_definition_of_a_wall_street_bet/","title":"The Quantitative Definition of a \"Wall Street Bet\"","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-11T05:21:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-11 05:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q5banz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q5banz/the_quantitative_definition_of_a_wall_street_bet/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q5banz/the_quantitative_definition_of_a_wall_street_bet/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"johntwit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/johntwit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"johntwit","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"Wall Street Bet \"の定量的な定義","the_new_excerpt":"ウォールストリート・ベットと通常のトレードを区別する数学的な境界線があります。\n普通のトレードと区別する数学的な境界があります。この境界は、トレードの期待される幾何学的成長率が、次のようになる点と言えるでしょう。\nトレードの幾何学的期待成長率がマイナスになるポイントと言えます。利用可能な資本の最小割合\nある取引をウォール・ストリート・ベットと認定するために必要な、利用可能な資本の最小割合wは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"华尔街打赌 \"的量化定义","the_new_excerpt":"有一个数学上的界限，将华尔街的赌注与普通的交易区分开来。\n普通交易。这个界限可以被描述为一个交易的预期几何增长率变成负数的点。\n边界可描述为交易的预期几何增长率变成负数的点。的最小部分。\n的最小部分，即w，需要将一项交易定性为华尔街赌注。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"華爾街打賭 \"的量化定義","the_new_excerpt":"有一個數學上的界限，將華爾街的賭注與普通的交易區分開來。\n普通交易。這個界限可以被描述爲一個交易的預期幾何增長率變成負數的點。\n邊界可描述爲交易的預期幾何增長率變成負數的點。的最小部分。\n的最小部分，即w，需要將一項交易定性爲華爾街賭注。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q5cfwy","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5cfwy/southwest_airlines_cancels_1800_flights_over_the/","title":"Southwest Airlines cancels 1800+ flights over the weekend citing staffing shortages, air traffic control issues, and weather as the cause.","date":"October 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"サウスウエスト航空、週末に1800便以上のフライトをキャンセル。原因はスタッフの不足、航空管制上の問題、そして天候にあるとしている。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"西南航空公司在周末取消了1800多个航班，理由是人员短缺、空中交通管制问题和天气原因。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"西南航空公司在週末取消了1800多個航班，理由是人員短缺、空中交通管制問題和天氣原因。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q5kk1r","excerpt":"I know there will be some comments of people saying that they both are\novervalued, blah blah blah.
