Avoid ARK ETFs at all costs, they have underperformed for a reason. We have yet to see capitulation.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all seen the headlines over the past week or so about rising bond yields, and I&#39;m honestly surprised that the majority of investors I&#39;ve talked to don&#39;t know how this affects their stock allocations. They read about the rising bond yields and how that hurts growth stocks, but the articles never dive into exactly why this happens. I felt compelled to write this post because I found out my mother put the majority of her 401K into QQQ, ARKK, and ARKG back in July. The recent downwards move in these names has her spooked, and on the phone she mentioned she has no idea why these ETFs (ARKK and ARKG in particular) are going down more than the rest of the market.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>To preface this post, this is not financial advice and I&#39;m not a financial advisor. But I have been investing my own money for the better part of the past two decades and have seen long term success. I&#39;ve learned a lot from my friends who work in the industry over the years so hopefully I can shed some light on how institutions, the ones driving the market, operate. I commonly rotate my investments based on what I&#39;ve learned and macroeconomic variables in order to achieve a more optimal strategic positioning in the market.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now, onto rising bond yields. This site lets you see the yields for notes of various maturities: <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield\">https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield</a>. All of the bond yields have risen this past week, but the one of particular concern is the yield on the 2 YR treasury note. It hasn&#39;t been this high since March 2020, and analysts are projecting it will rise even higher.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This move was fueled by fears of more persistent inflation, the upcoming taper that will begin after the November Fed meeting, and the prospect of rate hikes coming sooner than originally anticipated.  The Fed isn&#39;t alone either. Central Banks all around the world have signaled plans to tighten monetary policy: the BoE for example <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691\">https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691</a>, Brazil (except no one really cares about Brazil) <a href=\"https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike\">https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike</a>, and countries in the Eurozone <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH\">https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Fed officials at the most recent meeting moved up their expectations for a rate hike in 2022 and increased the number of rate hikes expected in 2023 (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/</a>). If inflation continues to persist, which is likely due to strong demand-pull and supply-side constraints like the disruptions we&#39;re seeing in Southeast Asia due to Covid, then we&#39;ll see these rate hike expectations move forward even more. A higher federal funds rate results in higher bond yields.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The market digested this information from last week and it is now being priced into the market. So why do growth stocks get hammered more than the rest of the market when bond yields rise? Even today, for October 1st, the NASDAQ rose 0.65% while the S&amp;P 500 rose a whopping 1.23%.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The reason is because of how companies are fundamentally valued. After all, the market isn&#39;t a casino, even though it can seem like it at times. Shout out to GME and AMC. So what does a company&#39;s stock price really represent?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, a company&#39;s stock price represents the present value of its future cash flows. This valuation method is commonly used in the industry and is known as a discounted cash flow (read <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp</a> if you want to expand on this even more but I&#39;ll summarize). Basically, how do you calculate the <strong>present</strong> value of <strong>future</strong> cash flows? You take those future cash flows and you <em>discount</em> them by the risk free rate, often represented by bond yields. The reason we do this discounting is because that future cash flow is worth less BECAUSE it happens in the future. That money, if available in the present, could have generated the risk free rate each year.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at an example to see how discounting works. Let us assume stock A is expected to produce cash flow of $100 in 2022, $200 in 2023, and $500 in 2024 and the risk free rate is 1%.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.01 + $200/(1.01)^2 + $500/(1.01)^3 = $780</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>But what happens if the risk free rate increases to 2%?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Then we get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.02 + $200/(1.02)^2 + $500/(1.02)^3 = $761</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The key takeaway from this is that rising bond yields mean future cash flows will be worth less at present. The reason growth stocks get so hammered on moves in bond yields is because the majority of their cash flow comes in the future, and that&#39;s why they can be valued so richly when bond yields are at record lows (like through all of 2020 and the beginning of 2021). Take Nikola, for example, it currently has no free cash flow but it&#39;s valued because it promises future free cash flow. Quantumscape, TuSimple, and so many more names fall into this category.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Growth stocks have fallen out of favor for this reason and is why ARKK, ARKG, and all of the other ARK ETFs have already dropped over 20% from their all time highs. The concentration of growth stocks in the NASDAQ is also the reason for its underperformance this past week.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Reddit forums always scream, &quot;don&#39;t fight the FED,&quot; and they&#39;re right. For times like these, it&#39;s best to rotate out of growth and into value names. The Fed TELLS you what they&#39;re going to do and this past Fed meeting was the most hawkish Fed meeting I&#39;ve listened to in a long time. I&#39;m not claiming that markets will crash, far from it, I&#39;m simply claiming that growth stocks are not where you want to be.</p>\n\n<p>This is going to hit a capitulation point when bond yields rise even more. This Twitter post shows the underperformance of ARKK&#39;s investments: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2\">https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2</a>. The only reason ARK is even alive is because of Tesla, and rising bond yields will eventually catch up to Tesla too, which is currently valued at 400x PE. You might be thinking now is a good time to pick up these names at a discount, but that would be ill-advised. If you&#39;re planning to hold for the next decade and through a potential 50-90% drawdown, then go ahead.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a reason Michael Burry has been shorting ARKK (<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html\">https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html</a>) and one of the largest positions in his fund is a Tesla short (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html</a>) specifically because he foresees an unfavorable environment for growth stocks.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve been wondering why SPACs have been dying, this is why.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve been wondering why your growth stocks have been dying, this is why.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve been debating whether or not to sell your ARK ETFs, this is why. Cathie Wood is simply a marketing genius who got lucky off moonshot plays in Bitcoin and Tesla, and then leveraged that success to convince the public to drive in-flows into her ARK ETFs over the past years. Those inflows helped propel a bunch of growth names higher, but ARK will eventually be a victim of its own success as outflows force selling into already declining stock prices. This reddit post is from February of 2021 when ARKK died because of, you guessed it, rising bond yields: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/</a>. Looking at the 2 YR yield, this time might be significantly worse. This is why I told my mother to move everything over to $VTI and a selection of value names: $ADNT, $GM, $F, $KRE, $HEES, $HRI, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The ONLY stock in ARKK with a reasonable PE multiple is COIN. Every other name has a multiple in either the high-flying hundreds, or the stock is simply a money burning piece of shit experiencing slowing growth. GL investors - stay safe out there. If you&#39;ve been holding ARKK, it&#39;s okay to take a loss. When investing, and over the long run, losses are bound to happen. My biggest losses all came from holding onto the hope that my stock would recover, even though I knew deep down it wouldn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>In case you were living under a rock this week: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-yield-surge-challenges-investor-confidence-in-big-tech-companies-11632907865\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-yield-surge-challenges-investor-confidence-in-big-tech-companies-11632907865</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzk05h/rising_bond_yields_what_they_mean_and_how_to_play/","title":"Rising bond yields: what they mean and how to play this","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-02T16:00:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-02 16:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pzk05h","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzk05h/rising_bond_yields_what_they_mean_and_how_to_play/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzk05h/rising_bond_yields_what_they_mean_and_how_to_play/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"UpDownSidewaysAction","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/UpDownSidewaysAction","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"UpDownSidewaysAction","score":63,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"債券利回りの上昇：その意味するところは何か、どうすればいいのか","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: 債券利回りの上昇は、投資家がグロースからバリューに回転することを意味する。\nARKのETFは絶対に避けてください、理由があってアンダーパフォームしています。我々はまだ\n屈服はまだ見ていません。\n\n\n\nこの1週間ほどの間に、債券利回りの上昇に関するニュースを目にしたと思います。\n債券の利回りが上昇しているというニュースをご覧になったと思いますが、私は正直、驚きました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"债券收益率上升：意味着什么以及如何玩这个游戏","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: 债券收益率的上升意味着投资者应该从增长型转向价值型。\n不惜一切代价避免ARK ETF，它们表现不佳是有原因的。我们还没有\n看到投降的情况。\n\n\n\n我相信你们都已经看到了过去一周左右关于债券收益率上升的头条新闻。\n债券收益率，说实话，我很惊讶......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"債券收益率上升：意味着什麼以及如何玩這個遊戲","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: 債券收益率的上升意味着投資者應該從增長型轉向價值型。\n不惜一切代價避免ARK ETF，它們表現不佳是有原因的。我們還沒有\n看到投降的情況。\n\n\n\n我相信你們都已經看到了過去一週左右關於債券收益率上升的頭條新聞。\n債券收益率，說實話，我很驚訝......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pzd4ni","excerpt":"TL;DR: IATSE, the union representing most below-the-line film workers, has\nstarted voting on a strike authorization and—as someone who works in the\nindustry—I'm certain it's going to pass.
