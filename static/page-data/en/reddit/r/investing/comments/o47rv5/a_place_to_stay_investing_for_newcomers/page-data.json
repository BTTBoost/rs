Investing can appear scary and complicated! The truth is that it is really quite simple, but requires discipline and resolve. It also requires that you make a plan, understand your plan, and sick to it with faithfulness. Be confident that you do not need to pay somebody else to do your investing for you!</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t need to question yourself, you don&#39;t need to panic, and you don&#39;t need to spend a single second looking at prices. All you need to do is stay the course. </p>\n\n<p>I created this post to provide guidance and distill my research into a digestible and actionable path for newcomers who feel intimidated and confused. If you take the time to read this post and put it in to practice, it can almost be guaranteed that in the long term you will outperform the average investor and even the average professional investor as well. It requires zero understanding of the stock market. Sounds too good to be true, but consider this fact: Fidelity found that the demographic of investors with the best performance were dead people, the second best group of performers were investors who forget about their accounts. Clearly, fancy strategies don&#39;t translate to fancy returns, so sit back, relax, and approach this advice with an open mind. </p>\n\n<p>Here it is:</p>\n\n<p>Investing requires you to answer two basic questions:\n1) What is my time horizon? \nIn other words, when will I need to withdraw the money?\n2) What is my risk tolerance?\nIn other words, will I get frazzled and lose sleep if stock prices drop 50%?</p>\n\n<p>Once you have answered these two basic questions, you can determine your personal asset allocation and begin saving. Then you will know what percentage should be invested in stocks and what percentage should be invested in bonds. The reason this is important is because it prevents you from selling your stocks at a loss. If you&#39;re going to sell at a loss, you would be better off not buying stocks in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Once you know the percentage going towards stocks, you can then decide which stocks to buy. If you have no clue what to buy, then you can&#39;t go wrong buying the entire stock market. VTSAX allows you to buy the entire US stock market with rock bottom fees. It is administered by Vanguard. They are my brokerage of choice because Vanguard is owned by the investors who purchase their funds; they don&#39;t answer to outside shareholders. However, other brokerages will do. You can purchase BND to buy the entire bond market or simply find another bond fund to your liking.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have purchased your investments, the next step is to not look at them and let them grow. This is the most difficult step and where most investors fail. You may want to rebalance occasionally however. If you&#39;re initial percentages shift out of alignment, you can buy and sell to reestablish your initial percentages. Or you don&#39;t have to do that at all! Most importantly, don&#39;t forget that you can&#39;t sell stocks when stock prices drop (prices will drop at some point). </p>\n\n<p>There are two phases of investing: wealth accumulation and wealth preservation. Retirement marks the transition. </p>\n\n<p>Retirement drawdown proposes slightly different considerations than retirement saving. This is the point in time that you may want to consider shifting your allocation away from stocks and more into bonds. This is because while you are living off your retirement savings, you will probably be selling every year even if the market goes down, so owning bonds provides more safety in that environment. Of course, this still depends on your personal risk tolerance. </p>\n\n<p>Once you figure out your annual budget in retirement, a good rule of thumb is the four percent rule. The four percent rule states that you can withdraw four percent of your retirement savings each year for spending. In other words, you become eligible for retirement when you have saved 25 times your annual expenses. Note that this does not account for other sources of income such as pension, annuity, social security, etc. So your individual numbers may be adjusted accordingly. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I pray that you may enjoy your gains and that the market may be kind to you. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Buy right and hold tight&quot; -Jack Bogle</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o47rv5/a_place_to_stay_investing_for_newcomers/","title":"A Place to Stay - Investing for Newcomers","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-20T18:55:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-20 18:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"68d2a0c2-7bf0-5017-9e53-a86cde688110","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o47rv5/a_place_to_stay_investing_for_newcomers/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o47rv5/a_place_to_stay_investing_for_newcomers/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"BlackDahliaMuckduck","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BlackDahliaMuckduck","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BlackDahliaMuckduck","score":47,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"居場所 - 新規参入者のための投資","the_new_excerpt":"Redditでは、投資を始めるためのアドバイスや知識を求める投稿が多く見られます。\n投資をしています。投資は怖くて複雑に見えるかもしれません。実際には、投資はとてもシンプルです。\n投資はとてもシンプルですが、規律と決意が必要です。また、投資には\n計画を立て、その計画を理解し、そしてそれに忠実であることが必要です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"住的地方--为新来者投资","the_new_excerpt":"我看到Reddit上有很多帖子在寻求关于如何开始投资的建议/知识。\n投资。投资可能看起来很可怕，很复杂! 事实是，它是\n真的很简单，但需要纪律和决心。它还要求\n你要制定一个计划，了解你的计划，并对它感到厌烦。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"住的地方--爲新來者投資","the_new_excerpt":"我看到Reddit上有很多帖子在尋求關於如何開始投資的建議/知識。\n投資。投資可能看起來很可怕，很複雜! 事實是，它是\n真的很簡單，但需要紀律和決心。它還要求\n你要制定一個計劃，瞭解你的計劃，並對它感到厭煩。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0b604ffa-3c42-5ff6-aed0-1a21e139bcc8","excerpt":"I know this question gets asked a lot...\n\nLittle about me: mid 30's, $80K salary, contribute to my 401k with every\npaycheck (no other investments), no debt, have home with low mortgage, have $50K\nemergency fund in savings.\n\nI don't really have any targeted investment goals besides just general…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o4ajdz/my_mom_passed_away_from_covid_last_year_left_me/","title":"My mom passed away from COVID last year - Left me $100K - How should I invest ?","date":"June 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"昨年、母がCOVIDで亡くなり、100Kを残してくれました。","the_new_excerpt":"この質問はよく聞かれることだと思いますが...。\n\n私について少し説明しますと、30代半ば、8万ドルの給料、毎給料日に401Kに拠出（他の投資はしない\n貢献している（他の投資はしていない）。借金はなく、低額の住宅ローンで家を持ち、5万ドルの\n5万ドルの緊急用資金を貯めています。\n\n私は、一般的な投資以外に、特に目標とする投資はありません。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我妈妈去年因COVID去世了 - 给我留下10万美元 - 我应该如何投资？","the_new_excerpt":"我知道这个问题被问得很多......\n\n关于我的一些情况：30多岁，8万美元的工资，每次发工资时都向我的401k捐款（没有其他投资）。\n没有其他投资），没有债务，有低抵押贷款的房子，有5万美元的\n储蓄的紧急基金。\n\n除了一般的投资目标外，我真的没有任何有针对性的投资目标...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我媽媽去年因COVID去世了 - 給我留下10萬美元 - 我應該如何投資？","the_new_excerpt":"我知道這個問題被問得很多......\n\n關於我的一些情況：30多歲，8萬美元的工資，每次發工資時都向我的401k捐款（沒有其他投資）。\n沒有其他投資），沒有債務，有低抵押貸款的房子，有5萬美元的\n儲蓄的緊急基金。\n\n除了一般的投資目標外，我真的沒有任何有針對性的投資目標...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1405733333871611907","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1405733333871611907","title":"OPINION: \"Sixty-two years later, in 2021, we have changed and it’s time for a reset, a transformation.
