Valve Corp, the jury unanimously found that Valve Corp infringed Ironburg’s controller patent and awarded Corsair’s subsidiary Ironburg (a subsidiary of SCUF) over $4 million</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Own Thoughts (my own opinion and not financial advice)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>-</strong> I believe this was a blowout quarter. Taking a look at page 42 of the 8-K filing, we can see that Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 83% in 2020 year-over-year to $539 million. In Q4 2020 alone, Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $192 million. Overall revenue in 2020 grew 55% year-over-year to $1.702 billion, while in Q4 alone revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to $556 million.</p>\n\n<p>- There were expansions of gross margin in both segments (gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems). Gamer and creator peripherals gross margin has expanded to 35% from 31% in 2018, while gaming components and systems gross margin has expanded to 24% from 17% in 2018. <strong>The fact that gross margin in the components and systems segment improved by 700 bps during that time period in a market that has notoriously low margins tells me that the marketing of Corsair’s products as premium quality, is working and that customers are choosing the higher priced items over lower priced competitor items.</strong> Corsair was also able to expand margin by engaging in less promotional activities which means that consumers most definitely choosing Corsair’s higher priced products over lower-cost competitors due to a variety of reasons such as build quality and brand loyalty. </p>\n\n<p>- I was extremely impressed with the improvement of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals gross profit by 133% year-over-year, which it seems was led by their Elgato streaming products for streamers and content creators. The margins are much higher in this area than in components and streamer customers seem to regard Elgato products with high enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<p>- Adjusted EBITDA tripled in 2020 to $213 million which it seems can be attributed to an explosion of demand for Corsair’s products by customers who are spending more time at home working and gaming.</p>\n\n<p>I plan on updating this sub with all developments related to Corsair.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lg5ryq/corsair_crsr_q4_2020_earnings_results/","title":"Corsair ($CRSR) Q4 2020 Earnings Results","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T21:21:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 21:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7b6fea8a-eb4d-561e-a1d4-afdcf0c9461f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg5ryq/corsair_crsr_q4_2020_earnings_results/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lg5ryq/corsair_crsr_q4_2020_earnings_results/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"LiveLaughLibor","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LiveLaughLibor","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"LiveLaughLibor","score":71,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"科赛尔($CRSR)2020年第四季度财报出炉","the_new_excerpt":"这是我在上周末做的Corsair DD帖子的后续文章。\n\n充分披露，我是一个股东，这不是财务建议。\n信息来自Corsair的8-K文件。这篇文章将被更新，如果有\n在稍后的财报电话会议后，是否有进一步的发展... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"科賽爾($CRSR)2020年第四季度財報出爐","the_new_excerpt":"這是我在上週末做的Corsair DD帖子的後續文章。\n\n充分披露，我是一個股東，這不是財務建議。\n信息來自Corsair的8-K文件。這篇文章將被更新，如果有\n在稍後的財報電話會議後，是否有進一步的發展... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0a611f2e-4084-540e-87a5-d94ddae0e572","excerpt":"A lot of new investors have flooded the stock market recently and both new and\nold have been swooped up into the short squeeze bets.\n\nTo whoever needs to hear this.. your losses are pennies on the dollar in\ncomparison to your future financial successes.
