So far I&#39;ve read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I&#39;m <strong><em>not</em></strong> a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I&#39;m content with that ... mostly. </p>\n\n<p>I often read people commenting &quot;X is undervalued&quot; or &quot;Y is overvalued&quot; and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I&#39;ve researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I&#39;ve read so far has suggested that if there were a way to &quot;beat the market&quot; with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. </p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they&#39;re not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on &quot;valuation&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ma29dn/personal_investor_valuation_vs_index_funds/","title":"Personal investor \"Valuation\" vs. Index funds","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-22T13:30:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-22 13:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3e5bd6a9-4608-5ee7-8f3b-1ff05cba0d4d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma29dn/personal_investor_valuation_vs_index_funds/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma29dn/personal_investor_valuation_vs_index_funds/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"vucar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/vucar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"vucar","score":69,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"个人投资者 \"估值 \"VS指数基金","the_new_excerpt":"我是一个业余投资者，进入投资领域2年左右，边学习边看书。\n尽可能多的。到目前为止，我已经读了《漫步华尔街》和其他几本。\n类似的书，让我相信，在转行之外和\n致力了解投资理财，尽我所能... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"個人投資者 \"估值 \"VS指數基金","the_new_excerpt":"我是一個業餘投資者，進入投資領域2年左右，邊學習邊看書。\n儘可能多的。到目前爲止，我已經讀了《漫步華爾街》和其他幾本。\n類似的書，讓我相信，在轉行之外和\n致力瞭解投資理財，盡我所能... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-633b6807-dd83-56d4-ab0c-3483ac1e3d52","excerpt":"Happy Monday r/stocks [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/]!\n\nI've been posting these every week over in r/options\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/] which some people actually enjoy so I\nthought this would be beneficial here for some of you.
