This makes you competitive in defense and industry. </p>\n\n<p>“We are an operating system for the modern enterprise.” What actions should insights drive?</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest investment areas over the past few years has been modulation. Proud ourselves on end to end solutions. We learned how the conventional architecture broke down or didn’t work. This became encoded in the product. But customers had to take everything. Now, they can pick what they need only and build on that. </p>\n\n<p>Foundry\nBianca rahill-marier product leader everything above ontology</p>\n\n<p>Central decision support framework. </p>\n\n<p>Ontology and simulation engine: preserve local governance. Data from across organization maps to objects/categories which can flow from and back into enterprise apps/solutions. Example: identify surplus of raw materialism supply chain flagged and notify sales of the opportunity. The ontology and resulting actions train the engine/models which allow simulation or “what-if” scenarios. Can be based on AI or simple logic or both. Models are bound to real world inputs and outputs. As well models can be bound together in a chained scenario providing the ability to understand the impacts of real world situations to the entire supply chain. Ie. you can test market impacting decisions not just for your part of the supply chain but all the way to the consumer. \nWhat took months now takes hours:\nData integration: takes raw data from many systems, joins and featurizes. User defined and inferred table relationships are created. \nUse case catalog: templates for common industry use cases. Provide a foundation of the hard stuff and flex within the framework. \nRoadmap:\nReach more customers through use case catalog\nModularity: \nInteroperability with data platforms or build 3rd party apps on top of foundry as a data platform\nReach more users: new mobile offering and collaboration solutions\nMobile app for field workers to be given task plan prioritized and based on broad data inputs\nShared spaced with foundry for purpose built efforts. Highly controlled permissions. \nBuild on AI applied to operations:\nDigital twin: provide dev ops for applying and creating purpose built models that can be quickly deployed\nSimulation engine: chained models to ask what if scenarios’ impact on the entire supply chain</p>\n\n<p>Gotham\nMartin Manville product leader cut teeth fightng finance crimes</p>\n\n<p>Shifted from counter terrorism to the near peer fight.
