&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve known about the omniverse announcement for awhile, so bought 227 shares at $220 ($49,940) two months ago. But &lt;a href=&quot;/r/bogleheads&quot;&gt;/r/bogleheads&lt;/a&gt; convinced me it was gambling so I took it out and I&amp;#39;m pissed I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in order to get that $50k I&amp;#39;d be having to sell 50k worth of VTSAX, meaning forfeiting early capital gains. I&amp;#39;ve only been investing for like 2 years, so it&amp;#39;s not that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or.... should I just leave the VTSAX alone, invest $500 per week in that, then another $500 per week in QQQ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand how people can exist with a trader mindset. It&amp;#39;s seems like you need to study alot of quasi science, be on social media constantly, do alot of cocaine, and it really just seems stressful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neat thing about reddit is I can look and see when people post their &amp;quot;analysis&amp;quot; of a stock. Which for 99% of reddit, is just a trader saying voodoo witch craft nonsense about enter and exit points, resistance this and that, cutting losses, and special orders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you ask for their portfolio and they have none or its top secret or something. It&amp;#39;s not illegal to share your portfolio you great traders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an average Joe, and I&amp;#39;m not that smart. so I feel really good when I read posts from people who buy a stock like MU, three years ago, at 40-43 a share, and sell it saying they see no future in it. It&amp;#39;s trading at like $83 now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it when I read people saying they bought Uber near ipo at 40 and sold at 32 and say it&amp;#39;s doomed to fail. But Uber is still around, in fact it hit a height of $60 last spring and now it&amp;#39;s $44. You haven&amp;#39;t even given it a chance to grow or become something yet. Like the company is a verb, give it a few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think traders are like fake friends in high school. They&amp;#39;re only around you if you&amp;#39;re cool. Once you&amp;#39;re not cool anymore they abandon you. But traders are onlu a small portion of money for a company a company makes stuff to sell to people and that&amp;#39;s what really draws in revenue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see alot of people talk about the &amp;quot;opportunity cost&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;oppurtuniy lost, &amp;quot; something like that when you&amp;#39;re not trading. Like if I buy something that isn&amp;#39;t moving fast, or something is in the red, it&amp;#39;s better to &amp;quot;cut my losses.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s like... Buying high and selling low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds like the exact opposite of what you&amp;#39;re supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;#39;d rather sink with my ship if you&amp;#39;re telling me to always sell the moment my stock goes red. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if I was so foolish as to pick a bad company, I&amp;#39;d rather just take the full loss, rather then death by a thousand cuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I pick companies that make more revenue every year, have increasing dividends, and are medium to large size growth companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m boring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just look at the best performing companies, read their 10k and just invest. My first two companies I bought were Apple and Starbucks, I then bought Nvidia and Realty Income. I bought Pennymac and Weyerhaeuser afterward. I just sorta sit on them. I just hold them and buy more. If I somehow become broke instantly from these decisions then damn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m investing in known companies with easy business models. I like safety and simplicity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m gonna become a multi millionaire with several cars and boats. I just want to make enough money to be the first millionaire in my family, and have my children live of my dividends so they don&amp;#39;t have to work so hard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just seems like people don&amp;#39;t have patience on the internet. And when you take the time to read people who argue about a particular stock, and then for those same people to be proven wrong by time. It feels good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I open a Roth as well? They sound very attractive for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using a taxable account as a safety net should I need to access some of the money. Also I was hoping to retire at 55 and use this account to bridge me over to my 401k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from my understanding I could open a Roth and take some or all of the principle out at anytime without penalty.  Also this money grows tax free and can be withdrawn tax free at 59.5. So essentially I could start taking the principle out early if I want to retire early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe its best to have a combination of all 3 401k, Roth, Taxable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geeking out about portfolios and studying and backtesting and so on is fun, I know, and I certainly agree that it is important to take the time to design a portfolio that is compatible with one&amp;#39;s objectives and risk tolerance; but, as with many other things, extra effort has diminishing returns and there soon comes a time when your time (heh) and work would be better spent elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point: lately I have been obsessing about whether to increase my bond allocation by 5% now or 2/3 years from now as per my initial plan (this has nothing to do with the market being &amp;quot;high&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m just concerned that I might be overestimating a little my risk tolerance), and I spent way more time thinking about this than putting extra work towards a certification that could increase my wages by about &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I... don&amp;#39;t think I have to spell out why this is not the best use of my time and effort. So yeah, it might be worth it to keep in mind that it is suboptimal to overallocate one&amp;#39;s resources towards portfolio optimization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if I know myself, the danger is that I&amp;#39;ll spend the next four months designing and refining the perfect allocation of my time and mental efforts towards my various work and life objectives rather than doing what I am supposed to do... :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bitcoin City” will be located along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano. The government plans on locating a power plant by the volcano to provide energy for both the city and bitcoin mining, the president said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Bukele, Bitcoin City will be a full-fledged metropolis with residential and commercial areas, restaurants, an airport as well as a port and rail service. The city will be laid out in a circle (like a coin) and in the city center will be a plaza that will be host to a huge bitcoin symbol. The city will have no income, property, capital gains or payroll taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bukele also said El Salvador plans on issuing $1 billion US “bitcoin bond,” a tokenized financial instrument developed by Blockstream, on the Liquid Network. Of that amount, $500 million will be used to help construct needed energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure and $500 million to buy even more bitcoin. At the cryptocurrency’s recent trading price of about $59,000, that would bring the country’s treasury stash to just under 2,000 bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;

This guy has a perspective that investing in SPY, IVV, VOO And Other S&amp;amp;P 500 ETFs may not be as wise or diversified as standard investment advice would make it seem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His perspective is that a large percentage of investors just buy SPY or similar ETFs. Such a sizable amount that the diversity argument for them is effected. Diversity only works well if there&amp;#39;s enough buyers and sellers of the individual stocks that make up the index. But if mostly everyone is buying the index, diversity doesn&amp;#39;t matter: as instead of the index &amp;quot;tracking&amp;quot; these stocks the index is influencing their price instead; thus you start to have similar liquidity issues as you would it you only bought stock in one or two companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the more people invest in index funds, the less effective the diversity of the index fund is, and the more liquidity risk you are exposed to. Basically it&amp;#39;s better to handle diversification more actively rather than rely on indexes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article was written in 2017, so he may not have foreseen the liquidity injections of 2020 and 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not quite sold on his thesis. What do you all think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem focuses on the brain and understanding how its reward systems can train you to trade compulsively and dangerously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some signs of addiction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spend far too much of your free time trading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are trading stocks at work (and it isn’t your job)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “high” of trying to find the next “moonshot” is the focus of attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have feelings for frustration, aggression or attempt to suppress other personal problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losing money on a position makes you depressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t stop trading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually looking at your phone to check the latest value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You lie to others about what you are doing on your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bulk of your investing advice comes from social media “experts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You borrowed money on a credit card, home equity line, or a personal loan to invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your emotional state is directly tied to the outcome of the stock market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lack of self-control or ability to stay away from your trading app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like many people that I know are addicted...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;CVS  40.68% of Portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LMT  24.82%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;DNOW 2.75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCYX 2.21%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to unpack here, but have at it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few notes. Massive reduction in securities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q2 ‘21 USD 147,257,000.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q3 ‘21 USD  41,719,000.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSLA PUTS comprised the largest portion of his portfolio in previous quarters and now make up 0%. Unknown what the actual loss was, but assume it was substantial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q2 ‘21 35% -&amp;gt; Q3 ‘21 0%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current lineup looks a hedge to some great coming apocalypse. This will end badly for Burry. I’d be surprised if SCION doesn’t shut down within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I come from a place where people were high-fiving when they get anywhere 6% inflation. Double digits were the norm back there. When I was a kid we lived under hyperinflation which is a complete shit show, people get their paychecks and immediately go buy their groceries for the month. This is not a figure of speech, they really did go IMMEDIATLY because the prices were readjusted 1 or 2 times IN THE SAME DAY. Concept of savings was non-existent. Either you buy as much US Dollars as possible or put in some asset that has intrinsic value like real estate. The house I grew up was huge, and I learned that was not because my father was in a good financial situation, but rather it was the only option to dump all his savings before it lose half of its value in matter of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, my bar is a bit out of place here... so should I be concerned with the 6.2% rate? My take on this: likely FED will increase rates, which will devalue bonds and stock prices. But then this should be already embedded in the current asset prices, so I don&amp;#39;t think I should be doing anything with my portfolio here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not trust financial market risk models. Reality is always too complex to be accurately modeled. Attention to risk must be a 24/7/365 obsession, with people – not computers – assessing and reassessing the risk environment in real time. Despite the predilection of some analysts to model the financial markets using sophisticated mathematics, the markets are governed by behavioral science, not physical science.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course I would space this out over a number of years so that I wouldn’t be in a position where I would need to access that money before the 1 year holding period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest to hear thoughts - do people think this is a good idea? How quickly can I bond funds be transferred to a bank account (after the 1 year hold period of course). My thinking is that in a major emergency, I could use a credit card to hold us over for a few weeks while we transfer the I bond money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just hate to have a decent amount of money sitting in an online savings account making 0.4% when it could be making 7.12% in an I bond.&lt;/p&gt;

Folks (like me) buy and sell the VOO ETF and behind the scenes Vanguard  takes the steps to periodically rebalance the index.  It&amp;#39;s my understanding that this rebalancing happens on dates known in advance.   As owners of the ETF, we hope not to see capital gains triggered by these rebalancing events because that means taxes.   My question is, how this rebalancing happens and is there some aspect around the ETF construct which allows vanguard to (say) sell a stock at a profit (as part of the rebalancing) yet somehow not pass that capital gain back to folks holding the ETF?   Or is vanguard leveraging tax loss harvesting as a means to counter capital gains and thus not pass gains to folks holding VOO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If vanguard is leveraging tax loss harvesting to counter gains in order to prevent capital gains from being passed on to VOO holders, can vanguard shuffle, behind the scenes, those tax losses between different ETFs or must those losses remain associated with the stocks tied to VOO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just trying to understand the details here...&lt;/p&gt;

This concept was created by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel and has actually held up for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASML designs and manufactures EUV lithography machines, which are extremely high precision machines that put complex designs on incredibly small chips. ASML is the only EUV lithography design and manufacturer in the world. Look up their stock performance and financials if you question these claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel used to be a top class chip manufacturer but they&amp;#39;ve struggled with the 7nm chips and their stock has been punished. The simple reason for Intel&amp;#39;s shortcomings is they&amp;#39;ve not been using EUV lithography machines from ASML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plain and simple, without EUV lithography, Intel has been handicapping itself for years now and is a big reason they have fallen behind. The last link below notes how their 7nm chip design is now using EUV lithography at the 2 new fab plants they are building for $20B in Arizona. Intel is going to start to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: ASML provides the technology to keep Moore&amp;#39;s Law alive and Intel hasn&amp;#39;t been using it until now. Their depressed, low P/E stock valuation will begin to correct with outperformance as their technology begins to catch-up after major mistakes not using EUV lithography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Indexes Company does not typically give reasons for changes to its indexes, and did not in Friday&amp;#39;s statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index is designed to reflect the performance of mainland Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, and includes the top 50 eligible stocks by a measure of their market value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evergrande&amp;#39;s shares have fallen over 80% year to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Hang Seng Indexes said they had added technology firms JD.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/9618.HK&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(9618.HK)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Netease &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/9999.HK&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(9999.HK)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the benchmark Hang Seng Index &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/quote/.HSI&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(.HSI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang Seng Indexes is trying to include more securities in the benchmark to make it more reflective of the companies listed in Hong Kong.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;($1 = 7.7917 Hong Kong dollars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Global average ocean freight rates for a 40-foot container have now declined for eight straight weeks&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Spot pricing for the busy Shanghai-to-Los Angeles trade route has bounced around more but is still down about 19% from its September peak.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meanwhile, the number of containers lingering for longer than nine days at the Port of Los Angeles has dropped by about a third since the hub announced a plan in October to start fining ocean carriers for excessive dwell times, Executive Director Gene Seroka said this week.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For all the doomsday warnings about the knock-on effects of the logjams on corporate earnings, companies generally seem to be managing fine — at least the large, public ones. [like Target]&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; U.S. manufacturing output rose in October to the highest level since March 2019, Federal Reserve data showed this week.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The factory production rebound was driven in part by an 11% jump in motor vehicles and parts, suggesting that even the automotive industry, hit hard by the semiconductor shortage, is navigating the supply crunch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg concludes that not everything is back to normal as many problems persists. But at least things are not getting worse and are improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this affect any of your investing strategy? What stocks will improve or go down based on this easing trend? Will J Powell&amp;#39;s job depend on this trend continuing?&lt;/p&gt;

But we thought we&amp;#39;d give some to our siblings, too. I have 4 siblings and wife has 2 siblings.

&lt;p&gt;Her logic is that it&amp;#39;s the same actual dollars going to our families that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My logic is that my siblings would get cheated out of their &amp;quot;fair share&amp;quot; compared to her siblings. Also, we&amp;#39;ve decided that only surviving siblings would get anything, and their widows or kids would not get anything if the sibling pre-deceases us. As we&amp;#39;re near the youngest of the siblings, it&amp;#39;s likely that not all 6 will be alive to get any money from us. Let&amp;#39;s say 2 of her siblings die, then we both die. What logic would suggest that my two siblings get 1%, but her two siblings get 2%? Madness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems stupid to be arguing about such details, but here we are. At an impossible impasse, with no possible resolution. But then came reddit...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you suggest we do?  If we can&amp;#39;t agree, we may do a &amp;quot;King Soloman&amp;quot; type of decision and give 0% to them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock market traded mixed today, with the both the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) slipping whiled the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed on the day, driven higher by a strong performance in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Numbers Today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPY: -0.19%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QQQ: +0.56%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DIA: -0.76%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (AAPL): +1.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said “Just like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:&lt;/strong&gt; 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing claims, week ended November 5:&lt;/strong&gt; 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
