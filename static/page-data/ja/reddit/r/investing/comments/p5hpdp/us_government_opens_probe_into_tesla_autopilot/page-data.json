The federal agency says since 2018 it has logged 11 incidents (which include 17 injuries and one fatality) in which Tesla vehicles using the company’s Autopilot features, like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. The agency says most of these incidents took place after dark, with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights, flares, cones, and an illuminated arrow board.</p>\n\n<p>The investigation will “assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation,” according to NHTSA’s notes.</p>\n\n<p>AN NHTSA SPOKESPERSON REMINDED THE PUBLIC THAT NO COMMERCIAL VEHICLES CAN DRIVE THEMSELVES\nA spokesperson for the agency said that the investigation was in its preliminary stages and primarily concerned with uncovering additional information about the incidents. The spokesperson noted that the public should be aware that no commercially available cars are able to drive themselves, and vehicles always require a human in control at all times.</p>\n\n<p>The inability of driving-assistance software from Tesla and other automakers to spot parked emergency vehicles is well known. Experts told Wired in 2018 that the likely cause is that these systems are programmed to mostly ignore stationary objects, otherwise they might react to all sorts of items on the side of roads, from signs to buildings.</p>\n\n<p>Wired’s report notes that both Tesla and Volvo’s driving assist manuals warn drivers about this problem. As Tesla’s says: “Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 mph (80 km/h) and a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary vehicle or object is in front of you instead.”</p>\n\n<p>The NHTSA has stepped up its scrutiny of Tesla in recent months as the company’s Autopilot software has been the focus of an increasing number of crashes. Many industry experts have criticized Tesla for its marketing of the software, which often suggests that human oversight of the vehicle is optional.</p>\n\n<p>In April, senators urged the NHTSA to take “corrective actions” against Tesla and prevent misuse of its driving-assist software, and in June the agency issued new rules requiring companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report all incidents involving such systems.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/p5hpdp/us_government_opens_probe_into_tesla_autopilot/","title":"US government opens probe into Tesla Autopilot crashes with emergency vehicles","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-16T16:48:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-16 16:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e628b71c-3ad9-5c4f-9bfb-24c15b8fdb89","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p5hpdp/us_government_opens_probe_into_tesla_autopilot/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p5hpdp/us_government_opens_probe_into_tesla_autopilot/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"thebabaghanoush","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thebabaghanoush","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"thebabaghanoush","score":883,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"米政府、テスラ社のオートパイロットによる緊急車両との衝突事故の調査を開始","the_new_excerpt":"The Verge:\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa\n\n米国高速道路交通安全局（NHTSA）は、Tesla社のオートパイロット・ソフトウェアについての調査を開始しました。\nテスラのオートパイロット・ソフトウェアを調査し、駐車中の緊急車両との衝突が繰り返されていることを指摘しました。\n停車中の緊急車両との衝突事故が頻発しているとして、調査を開始しました。\n\nこの調査は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国政府对特斯拉自动驾驶汽车与紧急车辆相撞事件展开调查","the_new_excerpt":"The Verge:\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa\n\n美国国家公路交通安全管理局（NHTSA）已经开始调查\n对特斯拉的自动驾驶软件进行调查，理由是该车多次与停在路边的汽车相撞。\n停放的紧急车辆相撞。\n\n该...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國政府對特斯拉自動駕駛汽車與緊急車輛相撞事件展開調查","the_new_excerpt":"The Verge:\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa\n\n美國國家公路交通安全管理局（NHTSA）已經開始調查\n對特斯拉的自動駕駛軟件進行調查，理由是該車多次與停在路邊的汽車相撞。\n停放的緊急車輛相撞。\n\n該...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-adecff37-7e9b-5988-8d75-81cd0ef02608","excerpt":"Hey everyone.
