It posted record revenues of $20bn, record net income of $8bn, and soared to a market cap of $615bn.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With that being said, if you had invested in Microsoft at the top of the dot com bubble you would not have seen a return on your investment until 2016.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe we are now in the midst of a similar timeline. Some valuations are through the roof without any grounding in reality. It is hard to know when it will correct but I am convinced that at some point investors will once again begin valuing companies as the value of their future free cash flows + a risk premium.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason I am adapting my personal investment strategy from 100% long to <strong>110% long and -10% short</strong> with some select picks.</p>\n\n<p>I will be diversifying my shorts and limiting their initial notional value, wary of irrationality continuing. I expect this to be an investment strategy I can stick to for at least 1 year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;d love to hear any contrarian views to my thesis and any thoughts on my short picks or suggestions.</strong></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>My picks (each will be -1% of my portfolio):</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. TSLA</strong> Not much needed to be said. Great company, love their products and direction. $800bn valuation is ludicrous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. SHOP</strong> $180bn valuation for $2.5bn revenue in 2020. 70% growth rate is great but where is my risk premium for my investment today?</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. UBER</strong> $113bn valuation with a -$22bn accumulated deficit. Gave up on self driving (their roadmap to profitability?) back in December. Propped up by SoftBank.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. ZM</strong> $126bn valuation with $2bn TTM revenue and $400m net income. Guys, this is a company who offer video communication software. 0 MOAT or risk premium.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. SNOW</strong> $85bn market cap, $489m TTM revenue and -$400m net income. For a data cloud service (hello have you heard of AWS/Azure/etc.?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. DASH</strong> $65bn market cap, $2bn revenue, -$200m net income. Financials aren&#39;t the most atrocious on this list but food delivery services (like ride sharing) are too location specific. No roadmap to global domination here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. LMND</strong> $10bn market cap for a &quot;tech&quot; insurance company with less than $100m revenue, -$100m net income. Their S-1 is filled with talk about their AI. Their &quot;chatbot AI&quot; on their website is a web form with a photo of a woman. Seriously?</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Picks I am less bearish on but still considering going short.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. ABNB</strong> $128bn market cap, $5bn revenue pre-covid. This one is hard for me. I like this company and think they have potential as a global business. Also a great pick post-covid. But I think $128bn is still too insane. Could be convinced otherwise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. NIO</strong> $94bn for the Chinese Tesla. Close to bankruptcy pre-2020 EV hype. Now has some momentum but $94bn worth? China growth can be scary though...</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. SPCE</strong> $13bn valuation. Richard Branson&#39;s pet project run rampant with a Chamath SPAC. Space, very cool. Return on investment is where sorry?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lj4312/some_valuations_are_absurd_i_am_going_10_short/","title":"Some valuations are absurd - I am going 10% short","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T02:59:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 02:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8ca6ffef-ad82-5ab5-a703-dee48a554db6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj4312/some_valuations_are_absurd_i_am_going_10_short/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj4312/some_valuations_are_absurd_i_am_going_10_short/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"noodlesource","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/noodlesource","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"noodlesource","score":153,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"有些估值是荒谬的--我将做空10%。","the_new_excerpt":"1999年，微软是一家伟大的公司。它公布了创纪录的200亿美元的收入。\n80亿美元的创纪录净收入，并飙升至6150亿美元的市值。\n\n说到这里，如果你在互联网的巅峰时期投资了微软\n泡沫你要到2016年才会看到投资回报。\n\nI…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"有些估值是荒謬的--我將做空10%。","the_new_excerpt":"1999年，微軟是一家偉大的公司。它公佈了創紀錄的200億美元的收入。\n80億美元的創紀錄淨收入，並飆升至6150億美元的市值。\n\n說到這裏，如果你在互聯網的巔峯時期投資了微軟\n泡沫你要到2016年纔會看到投資回報。\n\nI…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-63bb59c8-52a2-55fb-8c57-307679d654b0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbho3/no_tendies_for_valentines/","title":"No tendies for valentines","date":"February 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"没有tendies的情人节","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"沒有tendies的情人節","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7b02d3c4-7ad9-567a-a87f-881c4f4ba6a3","excerpt":"I did my research to find an alternative to Robinhood in light of recent events\nand finally initiated the full transfer of my Robinhood account to Fidelity.\nTheir website and app seems very information dense and not as easy to use as\nRobinhood but I am willing to learn and am never going to get back…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljbgib/how_many_of_you_have_moved_out_of_robinhood_and/","title":"How many of you have moved out of Robinhood and how many of you plan to do so in recent future?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 14, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你们中有多少人已经搬出了罗宾汉，又有多少人计划在近期搬出？","the_new_excerpt":"鉴于最近发生的事件，我做了研究，以寻找一个替代罗宾汉的方法。\n并最终启动了我的Robinhood账户的全部转移到Fidelity。\n他们的网站和应用程序似乎信息非常密集，而且不容易使用。\n罗宾汉的身份，但我愿意学习，而且永远也回不去了... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們中有多少人已經搬出了羅賓漢，又有多少人計劃在近期搬出？","the_new_excerpt":"鑑於最近發生的事件，我做了研究，以尋找一個替代羅賓漢的方法。\n並最終啓動了我的Robinhood賬戶的全部轉移到Fidelity。\n他們的網站和應用程序似乎信息非常密集，而且不容易使用。\n羅賓漢的身份，但我願意學習，而且永遠也回不去了... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-8ca6ffef-ad82-5ab5-a703-dee48a554db6","previousId":"RedditPost-63bb59c8-52a2-55fb-8c57-307679d654b0","nextId":"RedditPost-7b02d3c4-7ad9-567a-a87f-881c4f4ba6a3","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lj4312/some_valuations_are_absurd_i_am_going_10_short/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
