Shockingly, I find almost everyone who overweights USA stock will consciously look you in the eyes and say that it is quite obvious that USA stock is less risky, and it is because of that lower risk that USA stock will bring a higher return.</p>\n\n<p>People often make the mirror claim as well: They point out that investing in Chinese or EM companies is far riskier than investing in the USA, and therefore if you want long term high returns you&#39;d be a fool to overweight China/EM!</p>\n\n<p>And another related claim: Some say that ESG/clean energy companies are obviously the safe future bet, and at the same time they say that ESG/clean energy companies will obviously outperform the rest of the market going forward.</p>\n\n<p>In all of these cases, -you can only pick one.- Given that in none of these instances is the person claiming to be a subject matter expert who is knowledgeable beyond the total knowledge of the market. They will in all cases give basic, known information such as: &quot;America has long been the center of corporate innovation, and maintains a business friendly environment regardless of political party, whereas China is becoming increasingly controlling of their market.&quot; Or ESG folks will say, &quot;Fossil fuel consumption is down across the board, and solar energy is now cost competitive or cost superior in most areas of the globe.&quot; This is day-one minute-one basic information for any institutional investor or fund manager. Since they all know that the risk of Chinese stock is higher than the risk of American stock, then they will demand a lower price and therefore a higher expected return to take on that risk.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you are tempted to believe USA stock is safer and less risky due to it&#39;s superior environment, or sector positioning, or technological foundation, or whatever, then the next words out of your mouth should be, &quot;and that&#39;s why USA stock is expensive and I expect it to underperform.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qxpe52/you_cannot_rationally_believe_that_usa_stock_has/","title":"You cannot rationally believe that USA stock has a higher expected return than international at the same time that it has lower risk than international.
