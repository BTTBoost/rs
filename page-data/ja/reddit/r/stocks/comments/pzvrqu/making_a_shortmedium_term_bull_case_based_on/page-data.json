Swing trading means my horizon is between days and weeks/a few months.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to do with this post is to make a case for a short-/medium term bottom purely based on TA.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that there are many investors out there that think TA is complete and utter garbage but my performance to date in 2 portfolios is 33 and 36% while the S&amp;P 500 is &quot;only&#39; up 16% for the year.\nPlease don&#39;t down vote me purely based on your hate for TA.</p>\n\n<p>So why would someone use TA? There was an article posted by a community member that insider trading is alive and well. The news are full of &quot;old&quot; news that someone else already knew before. The goal of TA is to find turning points based on those signals caused by insider trading.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: The market price reflects the true value based on every investors current knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>But lets move on to the bull case!</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> does not allow me to add charts to this post so if you really have any questions message me please. I don&#39;t want to get banned! My goal is to educate as many investors as possible. If someone can let me know how to copy paste charts in here I would highly appreciate it.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite chart is the daily candlestick chart. I toggle between daily, 4h and weekly charts to get the best setup.\nI use 20, 50 and 200 moving averages, Bollinger Bands, Slow Stoch, MACD, RSI and momentum. Yes they are all almost the same but each of them gives me unique insight.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with the VIX:\nIt is a measure of fear and expected market volatility.\nVIX spiked 3-19-20 and a bottom was made 3-23-2020.\nWe had 3 double spikes so far (1 week apart). One was 3-14-21. NDX 100 bottomed 3-15-21.\nWe had another one in May that matched a bottom and we had one 3 days ago and NDX 100 might have bottomed then</p>\n\n<p>MACD:\nMACD reading were extremely low in March, May and last week for the NDX100. As long as we trade above the 200 day average those low readings support a short-/medium term bottom. The hammer candle Friday together with the low MACD reading made a bottom very likely.</p>\n\n<p>Russell 2000:\nI love the Russell 2000 because it gives you a less distorted picture of the US stock market because it is not only driven by a handful of tech companies.\nRussell 2000 went sideways for most of 2021 because we strayed to far from the 200 day average. We finally touched the 200 day average and last week we made a nice hammer candle in the weekly chart. This weeks weekly candle was undecided. In the daily chart we regained the 20, 50, 200 day average and a months long uptrend line. This should bode well for higher stock prices.</p>\n\n<p>Europe:\nFEZ touched the 200 day average and is very likely to bounce from here.\nGerman Index is in a huge bullflag pattern.</p>\n\n<p>I can comment on Asia separately but the correction there seems to have stopped.</p>\n\n<p>Summary:\nI think based on TA we are set up for a nice year end rally. How far we can go I have no clue but 10% should be possible. Then we have to reassess. \nThis is just a short-/medium term prognosis.</p>\n\n<p>Happy to discuss. Please only serious discussions. Not: TA is bullshit etc.\nIf you do it right it is working.</p>\n\n<p>Have a great weekend and Happy Trades!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzvrqu/making_a_shortmedium_term_bull_case_based_on/","title":"Making a short/medium term bull case based on technical analysis!","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-03T04:52:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-03 04:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pzvrqu","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzvrqu/making_a_shortmedium_term_bull_case_based_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzvrqu/making_a_shortmedium_term_bull_case_based_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Chart-trader","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chart-trader","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Chart-trader","score":45,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テクニカル分析による短期・中期のブルケースを作る!","the_new_excerpt":"トレーダーの皆さん、こんにちは。\n\n私はデフォルトではスイングトレーダーであり、すべての判断にテクニカル分析を使用しています。\nスイングトレードとは、私の水平線が数日から数週間、または数ヶ月であることを意味します。\n\nこの記事でやりたいことは、短期・中期的な底打ちを純粋に主張することです。\n今回の投稿でやりたいことは、純粋にTAに基づいて短・中期的な底打ちを主張することです。\n\n私が理解しているのは、そこには...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在技术分析的基础上做一个短期/中期的牛市案例!","the_new_excerpt":"交易员你好!\n\n我是一个默认的波段交易者，我的所有决定都使用技术分析。\n波段交易意味着我的视野在几天和几周/几个月之间。\n\n我在这篇文章中想做的是为短期/中期的\n抄底的理由，纯粹是基于TA。\n\n我了解到，有很多人都不知道该怎么办。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在技術分析的基礎上做一個短期/中期的牛市案例!","the_new_excerpt":"交易員你好!\n\n我是一個默認的波段交易者，我的所有決定都使用技術分析。\n波段交易意味着我的視野在幾天和幾周/幾個月之間。\n\n我在這篇文章中想做的是爲短期/中期的\n抄底的理由，純粹是基於TA。\n\n我瞭解到，有很多人都不知道該怎麼辦。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q06w6f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q06w6f/simpsons_predict_everything/","title":"Simpsons predict everything","date":"October 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"シンプソンズはすべてを予測する","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"辛普森一家预测一切","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"辛普森一家預測一切","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q06vt4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q06vt4/chaos_escalates_in_evegrande_as_investor/","title":"Chaos escalates in evegrande as investor threatens to harm themselves with a knife during meeting","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 03, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投資家が会議中にナイフで自殺すると脅迫したため、evegrandeで混乱が拡大","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"投资者在会议期间威胁要用刀子伤害自己，伊夫格朗德的混乱升级","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資者在會議期間威脅要用刀子傷害自己，伊夫格朗德的混亂升級","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pzvrqu","previousId":"RedditPost-q06w6f","nextId":"RedditPost-q06vt4","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzvrqu/making_a_shortmedium_term_bull_case_based_on/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
