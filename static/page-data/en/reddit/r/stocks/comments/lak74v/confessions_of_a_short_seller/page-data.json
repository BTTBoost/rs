Margin calls out the ass. Like $200k per day. If I bought back the stock (covered) I would never be able to borrow it again so I would be totally locked out. I bought the same number of shares that I was short so that I was both short and long (short against the box it is called). No matter which way the stock went I was even. When it finally peaked at $55 and started falling like a rock I sold my long side every day that I had enough margin and rode it down to $9. I made about $180k but believe me, it wasn&#39;t worth the stress.</p>\n\n<p>I am so tired of people saying that the shorts haven&#39;t covered. Or one neophyte asking &quot;What day are the shorts going to cover?&quot; I don&#39;t have a horse in this race (I day traded it last week several times) but I feel very bad for the new people getting in at the high. Especially one who said &quot;I paid my rent by credit card and used the money to buy GME&quot; That person is already under water.</p>\n\n<p>GME shorts all covered and/or boxed last week. Do you really think that you guys collectively have enough buying power to move it it from $65 to $483 with 500 million shares on your own? Time for a reality check.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","title":"Confessions of a short seller","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T03:37:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 03:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a3c4a8f6-2f5e-5d2c-a13f-ef77177ab21f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"bighdaddie","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bighdaddie","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"bighdaddie","score":29,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"卖空者的自白","the_new_excerpt":"你想要现实吗？我在80年代是个大空头。做空Iomega\n12元，就到了55元。保证金叫出了屁股。比如每天20万。如果我\n买回股票（覆盖），我将永远无法再借到它，所以我\n会被完全锁定。我买了同样数量的股票... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"賣空者的自白","the_new_excerpt":"你想要現實嗎？我在80年代是個大空頭。做空Iomega\n12元，就到了55元。保證金叫出了屁股。比如每天20萬。如果我\n買回股票（覆蓋），我將永遠無法再借到它，所以我\n會被完全鎖定。我買了同樣數量的股票... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d78a129f-2323-508c-b84e-73d1254e6354","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laeixr/johnny_sins_is_with_us/","title":"Johnny Sins is with us!!! 🚀🚀🚀","date":"February 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"约翰尼-辛斯和我们在一起！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！\"。🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"約翰尼-辛斯和我們在一起！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！\"。🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-716e68d8-88e6-58f1-82a2-d41e1089f55d","excerpt":"Dear SEC and President Biden,\n\nI am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of\nSecurity Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that\nartificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of\nthe laws of the United States.\n\nSection…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/","title":"15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 02, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"《美国法典》第15章第78i节 -- -- 短梯攻击的非法性(法律见解)","the_new_excerpt":"亲爱的证监会和拜登总统，\n\n我今天根据《美国法典》第15卷第78i条，题为 \"操纵 \"的规定，给你打电话。\n证券价格，禁止采取操纵和欺骗性的手段，以达到提高证券价格的目的。\n人为地压低GME和AMC证券的价格，违反了。\n美国的法律。\n\n第...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"《美國法典》第15章第78i節 -- -- 短梯攻擊的非法性(法律見解)","the_new_excerpt":"親愛的證監會和拜登總統，\n\n我今天根據《美國法典》第15卷第78i條，題爲 \"操縱 \"的規定，給你打電話。\n證券價格，禁止採取操縱和欺騙性的手段，以達到提高證券價格的目的。\n人爲地壓低GME和AMC證券的價格，違反了。\n美國的法律。\n\n第...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-a3c4a8f6-2f5e-5d2c-a13f-ef77177ab21f","previousId":"RedditPost-d78a129f-2323-508c-b84e-73d1254e6354","nextId":"RedditPost-716e68d8-88e6-58f1-82a2-d41e1089f55d","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lak74v/confessions_of_a_short_seller/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
