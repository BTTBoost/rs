People don&#39;t understand that Volkswagen was running higher presqueeze at 100-200 at base value. So in comparison, if the GME squeeze happened last Thursday it already beat it by about 10 fold.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The VW short squeeze is quite different to what we&#39;re seeing with GME. The short interest was only ~12%. Things only kicked into gear when Porsche unexpectedly announced they&#39;d increased their stake in VW to 74%. Combined with a 20% stake owned by another entity and the requirement for indexes that track the DAX to have a position in VW, there was less than 1% off the float left to trade.</p>\n\n<p>in VWs case, short sellers buying to close were literally returning shares to Porsche who was taking the company private and was not reselling those shares on the market to make a profit at any price. They could buy up every share available and literally take volume to zero without having covered all their shorts.</p>\n\n<p>For GameStop, short sellers return their shares to other investors who eventually plan to sell for a profit, freeing up more shares available to close remaining shorts. They can close positions of more than 100% of the float as long as there is enough volume, which there has been the last few days... they just need to bid high enough. That wasn’t possible for VW shorters. &quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lb253p/some_key_differences_between_vw_and_gme_squeeze/","title":"Some Key Differences between VW and GME Squeeze!
