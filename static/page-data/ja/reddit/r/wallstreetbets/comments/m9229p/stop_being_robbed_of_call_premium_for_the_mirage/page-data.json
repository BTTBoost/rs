If implied volatility is over 100-200%, there&#39;s very little money to be made with calls. Your dumbass wants to start a gamma squeeze? Well it won&#39;t fucking happen if you&#39;re paying so much per delta that the option seller will have cash left over even after hedging.</p>\n\n<p>You would be much more powerful if you bought shares instead of calls. The cheapest and most permanent way to increase the share price is to buy shares. Gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with. Also that hefty call premium you&#39;re paying goes to those betting against GME. Stop giving them your power (money) to use against you.</p>\n\n<p>It pisses me off to see normies and OG retards lose all their savings despite the best intentions.
