The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.</p>\n\n<p>For February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge – rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank&#39;s 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months “is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done &quot;gradually over time, and with great transparency.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical [sectors] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.</p>\n\n<p>Despite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&amp;P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today&#39;s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S. crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4% on Thursday as additional virus-related lockdowns in Europe and Asia raised demand concerns, outweighing supply issues due to an ongoing blockage of the Suez Canal. </li>\n<li>Consumer sentiment firmed in March, rising to the highest level in a year as stimulus checks and quicker-than-expected vaccinations gave Americans hope of a strong post-pandemic recovery, according to an analysis done at the University of Michigan</li>\n<li>WeWork, the embattled office-sharing company, agreed to a merger in order to go public at a valuation of around $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion valuation the company was worth in 2019.

Last summer, with the economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed blocked buybacks and capped dividends to recent profits to force the big banks to conserve capital.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written in the morning, premarket, and does not reflect intraday changes*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Alliance Data Systems (ADS) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $105 to $150 at Overweight.
