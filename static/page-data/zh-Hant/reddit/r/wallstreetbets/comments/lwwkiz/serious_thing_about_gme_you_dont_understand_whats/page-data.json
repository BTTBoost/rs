No space mission has taken less than a month to plan, like ever. These things take time. What is so beautiful to me is how a group of average people have banded together, Wall street is SCARED of us. We did not &quot;Manipulate the market&quot;, we rallied for a common cause, some of us lost money, some gained. You see the problem is that, the government has always been scared of us, because like ants, there is strength in numbers... </p>\n\n<p>Our Autist asses are making HISTORY... One day when Elon Musks Grandkids are studying at Harvard school of Business they&#39;ll be talking about the great movement on Wall street from 2021, DFV will be there, Wallstreetbets will be there, And each and every single one of you, will have partaken in a true moment in History.</p>\n\n<p>This could not have been accomplished without you smooth brained apes. Let&#39;s not stop here, Wallstreet is scared, The Hedgies are getting their asses chewed by the Wall and Old Money.</p>\n\n<p>A bright young man once said - I like the stock...
