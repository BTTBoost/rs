And the margin of error has to be low.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of the tickers I think that should go here.</p>\n\n<p>WMT(Walmart): A trillion dollar company in the making.</p>\n\n<p>AMD(AMD): They are eating INTC&#39;s lunch and also to some extent are also eating NVDA&#39;s lunch. Huge growth ahead.</p>\n\n<p>BRK.B(Berkahire Hathway): When Warren buys his stock, you know it’s undervalued.</p>\n\n<p>BABA(Alibaba): While some might disagree sighting China danger, I think it’s overblown. And when people tend to fear something too much, that&#39;s when they undervalue things.</p>\n\n<p>STMP(Stamps.com): An underrated gem which seems like too good to be true for its lowly valuation. I have tried to find some good reasons why this was so blindingly undervalued. I couldn’t find anything reasonable to allow for such a huge discounted valuation.</p>\n\n<p>TYO:7974(Nintendo): The best IP company to own for the upcoming gaming decades. At least 40% undervalued according to my base case estimates(using conservative figues).</p>\n\n<p>GOLD(Barrick Gold): This one is a little more dependent on the assumption that gold won&#39;t tank any more. If it doesn’t, I don&#39;t know why you wouldn’t want to own this one.</p>\n\n<p>PFE(Pfizer): I don&#39;t know how this could be in such a valuation despite their good pipeline and numerous ventures.</p>\n\n<p>ULVR.L(Unilever): This one is also dependent on the assumption that GBP doesn’t rise any higher. If it doesn’t, you can thank me later.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s some of the tickers that I think of. What are some of the tickers that you can think of and why?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m7iu5f/lets_have_a_discussion_on_some_stocks_that_are/","title":"Let's have a discussion on some stocks that are obviously undervalued","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T10:48:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 10:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"bad396df-2eef-5140-acdc-4db37d3445bd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m7iu5f/lets_have_a_discussion_on_some_stocks_that_are/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m7iu5f/lets_have_a_discussion_on_some_stocks_that_are/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"potatoandbiscuit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/potatoandbiscuit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"potatoandbiscuit","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我们来讨论一下一些明显被低估的股票吧","the_new_excerpt":"在这里，我所说的显然是指做保守的DCF估计，以确定。\n股票价值。而且误差范围要低。\n\n下面是一些我认为应该去的行情。\n\nWMT（沃尔玛）。一个万亿美元的公司在制造。\n\nAMD(AMD)：一个正在崛起的万亿美元公司。他们在吃INTC的午餐，也在吃... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們來討論一下一些明顯被低估的股票吧","the_new_excerpt":"在這裏，我所說的顯然是指做保守的DCF估計，以確定。\n股票價值。而且誤差範圍要低。\n\n下面是一些我認爲應該去的行情。\n\nWMT（沃爾瑪）。一個萬億美元的公司在製造。\n\nAMD(AMD)：一個正在崛起的萬億美元公司。他們在喫INTC的午餐，也在喫... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a70d5dac-6951-52d4-957d-cfd578eca367","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7kttl/i_really_messed_up_ruined_rest_of_my_life/","title":"I really messed up, ruined rest of my life","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我真的搞砸了，毁了我的后半生。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我真的搞砸了，毀了我的後半生。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e248c7af-0d95-51dd-b7da-d1d09e244111","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7mfkv/fiiine_ill_buy_more_shares/","title":"Fiiine I’ll buy more shares","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"好，我多买点股票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"好，我多買點股票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-bad396df-2eef-5140-acdc-4db37d3445bd","previousId":"RedditPost-a70d5dac-6951-52d4-957d-cfd578eca367","nextId":"RedditPost-e248c7af-0d95-51dd-b7da-d1d09e244111","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m7iu5f/lets_have_a_discussion_on_some_stocks_that_are/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
