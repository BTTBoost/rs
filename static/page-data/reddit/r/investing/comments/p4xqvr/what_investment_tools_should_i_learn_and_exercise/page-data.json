What do I do?\nI’m 19 and live in America.\nI’m not employed currently because I’m going to be attending college full time on August 28th.\nMy objectives with this money are to become completely financially independent so I won’t have to work for someone else, or at the very least be able to have my own place and car with enough money to the side to take vacations.\nI don’t need money in the next couple of months as my only monthly expenses are an $11 gym membership and a $60 phone bill along with $110 budgeted for food.\nI need to know it is 100% safe.\nI don’t own any assets in stocks or options and don’t know how these things work.\nI have no debt.\nI’m in college for computer science and plan to get into software engineering.\nI know how to make websites and make customized clothing and make music videos, but I make little to no money with any of these skills($85 a month or less) despite these skills taking me months to learn.\nI turn 20 in less than two months.\nI don’t have family members who can teach me much in investing. My dad and stepdad ask me for money and don’t pay me back and my mom can barely handle rent.\nI have no kids and don’t plan on making any for many years.\nNo felonies.\nI am easily distracted and a slow learner.\nAll I know about stocks is to put your money in the company and if the company does well, the line goes up, you sell the stock, and you make money.\nI’m in community college right now but I will be transferring to a four year in the spring possibly, and tuition will become more   expensive.\nIf I don’t have enough to invest to make a passive income, what should i learn? What are the most statistically useful investing tools with a low chance of failure? I don’t want to learn anything that’s incredibly risky or unreliable. I also don’t want to  learn anything that will only make me pennies a year. I want to know what will allow me to live comfortably so I won’t have to slave for someone else. Also, what free books or resources would you recommend to learn these things? I don’t have money  to pay for extra material on top of my college books. I just want to invest my time and energy into things that will actually pay off for once in my life.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/p4xqvr/what_investment_tools_should_i_learn_and_exercise/","title":"What investment tools should I learn and exercise as a broke college student?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-15T23:42:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-15 23:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dea9417f-dc78-5ae6-8da5-83dc45cce673","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p4xqvr/what_investment_tools_should_i_learn_and_exercise/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p4xqvr/what_investment_tools_should_i_learn_and_exercise/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"slugsquad0007","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/slugsquad0007","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"slugsquad0007","score":114,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"金欠の大学生が学んで鍛えるべき投資ツールとは？","the_new_excerpt":"おい、4,000ドル持ってるぞ。何をすればいいの？僕は19歳で、アメリカに住んでいる。8月28日から大学にフルタイムで通うことになったので、現在は無職です。\n8月28日からフルタイムで大学に通うことになったので、今は無職です。私の\nこのお金の目的は、完全に経済的に自立することです。\n誰かのために働かなくてもいいように経済的に自立すること、そして少なくとも...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"作为一个破产的大学生，我应该学习和锻炼哪些投资工具？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我有4,000美元。我应该怎么做？我19岁，住在美国。我目前没有工作\n因为我将在8月28日去上全职大学。我的\n这笔钱的目的是让我在经济上完全独立，这样我就不必为别人工作。\n这样我就不用为别人工作了，或者至少...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"作爲一個破產的大學生，我應該學習和鍛鍊哪些投資工具？","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，我有4,000美元。我應該怎麼做？我19歲，住在美國。我目前沒有工作\n因爲我將在8月28日去上全職大學。我的\n這筆錢的目的是讓我在經濟上完全獨立，這樣我就不必爲別人工作。\n這樣我就不用爲別人工作了，或者至少...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1427028849649504256","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1427028849649504256","title":"RT @PeterAlexander: NEW: The US military has flown at least 500 Embassy personnel out of Afghanistan on military aircraft, defense official…","date":"August 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @PeterAlexander 新着情報：米軍は少なくとも500人の大使館員を軍用機でアフガニスタンから脱出させたと、国防当局が発表しました。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"NEW: 米軍は少なくとも500人の大使館員を軍用機でアフガニスタンから脱出させたと国防当局者が@ckubeNBCに語っています。\n1日に5,000人の輸送を目指しているが、2、3日はその能力がないだろう。"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @PeterAlexander: 新消息：国防部官员表示，美国军方已经用军用飞机将至少500名使馆人员送出阿富汗。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"新消息：国防部官员告诉@ckubeNBC，美军已经用军用飞机将至少500名使馆人员送出阿富汗。\n他们正在努力争取每天运送5000人，但在几天内不会有这种能力。"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @PeterAlexander: 新消息：國防部官員表示，美國軍方已經用軍用飛機將至少500名使館人員送出阿富汗。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"新消息：國防部官員告訴@ckubeNBC，美軍已經用軍用飛機將至少500名使館人員送出阿富汗。\n他們正在努力爭取每天運送5000人，但在幾天內不會有這種能力。"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1426999014873047040","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1426999014873047040","title":"They actually released this https://t.co/eCHTo8HuOi","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 15, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"実際にリリースされたのはこのhttps://t.co/eCHTo8HuOi。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"他们实际上发布了这个https://t.co/eCHTo8HuOi","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"他們實際上發佈了這個https://t.co/eCHTo8HuOi","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-dea9417f-dc78-5ae6-8da5-83dc45cce673","previousId":"TweetPost-1427028849649504256","nextId":"TweetPost-1426999014873047040","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/p4xqvr/what_investment_tools_should_i_learn_and_exercise/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
