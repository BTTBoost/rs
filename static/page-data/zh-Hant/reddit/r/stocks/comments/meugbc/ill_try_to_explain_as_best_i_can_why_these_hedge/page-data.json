It’s already beginning. So, big banks and hedge funds have been having the biggest bash of their lives because the fed got rid of the SLR for banks and treasuries. Simply put, this allowed banks to have much more liquidity and free flowing money. </p>\n\n<p>When this ends on the 31st, the big banks will be required to have north of 6%+ in asset protection for any losses incurred. All this means is that they are going to have to start being frugal with their money again. All this easy money flowing through all these huge firms this past year will basically be recalled by the big banks. Hence, the margin call and the sell of Viacom, etc. They had to liquidate their positions because the banks are going to need to start collecting that free flowing money back to meet the SLR once again. </p>\n\n<p>From what I read, this actually isn’t as bad as it sounds. A lot of articles pointed that it will be a slow move from no SLR to working its way back to SLR that existed before coronavirus hit. BUT, regardless many, many firms and institutions that have been riding in this easy money will need to pay the piper. </p>\n\n<p>What does this mean? Possibly large sell offs in blue chip stocks, huge net losses in shorted stocks where they will have to cover the shares back and then pay the piper. But I think the biggest thing is that interest rates, such as the borrow fee rates for shorting stocks could skyrocket. Upwards of 100% or more which will cause MASSIVE short squeezes across the board. This is what he’s talking about. Shorting is a risk with infinite downside and lenders will not be so keen to let these institutions and firms shorting stock with little risk to them. Hope that helps clarify things. </p>\n\n<p>So if a borrow fee goes up to 50-100% + for any  stocks that are heavily shorted it will instantly cause them to cover their positions in turn causing MOASS across the boards for many, many stocks. So to sum up, selling off of institutional investments driving market prices down in some stocks. Potential covering of positions in shorted stocks, cause let’s face it. All these shorts deserve to burn in hell and I hope they get their just deserves! Guess what PARTYS OVER</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/meugbc/ill_try_to_explain_as_best_i_can_why_these_hedge/","title":"I’ll try to explain as best I can why these hedge funds are getting margin called and how it might be just the beginning.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-28T05:34:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-28 05:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"4f498475-5cac-5662-b3c5-ce259cfbc40e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/meugbc/ill_try_to_explain_as_best_i_can_why_these_hedge/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/meugbc/ill_try_to_explain_as_best_i_can_why_these_hedge/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Trickre1678","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Trickre1678","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Trickre1678","score":2678,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我会尽量解释为什么这些对冲基金会被追缴保证金，以及这可能只是一个开始。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，我将试着解释一下我认为在SLR之后会发生的事情。\n生效。已经开始了。所以，大银行和对冲基金已经。\n因为美联储取消了单反相机，所以他们一生中最大的一次抨击。\n为银行和国债。简单来说，这让银行可以有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我會盡量解釋爲什麼這些對沖基金會被追繳保證金，以及這可能只是一個開始。","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，我將試着解釋一下我認爲在SLR之後會發生的事情。\n生效。已經開始了。所以，大銀行和對沖基金已經。\n因爲美聯儲取消了單反相機，所以他們一生中最大的一次抨擊。\n爲銀行和國債。簡單來說，這讓銀行可以有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c679b5dd-2cf9-5d91-95a5-dd03da9e1cc9","excerpt":"I spent the last two weeks getting my karma up to 50 so I could make this post.\nSorry r/AskReddit [/r/AskReddit].\n\nThis is a 100% self serving post but I feel like I gotta share and who better to\nburden than the very people who changed my life.\n\nHere goes nothing.\n\nSeveral years ago I found myself…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/met1x7/living_the_american_dream_almost_40_i_have_worked/","title":"Living the American Dream.
