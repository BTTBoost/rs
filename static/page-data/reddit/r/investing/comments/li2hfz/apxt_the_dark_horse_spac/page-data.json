The deal is expected to close this quarter and AvePoint will begin trading under the new ticker AVPT.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this one of the most undervalued SPACs right now?</p>\n\n<p>1.) All Star Leadership</p>\n\n<p>Both Apex and AvePoint boast great leadership teams. At Apex, Jeff Epstein (lol), serves as the co-CEO and CFO. Jeff has held board/executive positions at companies such as Oracle, Twilio, Nielsen, Booking Holdings among others. The other co-CEO, Brad Koenig has served as the Global Head of Technology Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs for 15+ years and has served clients such as Dell, eBay, Microsoft, SAP, Veritas, Oracle in advisory capacities. Both Jeff and Brad will join the board of AvePoint once the merger goes through.</p>\n\n<p>The current CEO of AvePoint Tianyi Jang, who&#39;s 23 years in the industry include positions at Deutsche, Lehman Brothers, and Citadel will remain as the CEO. The rest of the executive team boast past positions at companies such as Deloitte, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Verizon, Merril Lynch and many others.</p>\n\n<p>2.) Total Addressable Market</p>\n\n<p>We all know how huge cloud computing is and will continue to be through the future. This is no new news. AvePoint estimates their TAM to grow to over $33B by 2022. As a strategic cloud partner of Microsoft and a 5x Global Partner of the Year Recipient, they&#39;re very well positioned to grow along side Microsoft and the cloud computing space as a whole. This growth is only being accelerated by the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-23-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-6point3-percent-in-2020\">https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-23-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-6point3-percent-in-2020</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/tmt/library/covid19-cloud-infrastructure.html\">https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/tmt/library/covid19-cloud-infrastructure.html</a></p>\n\n<p>This partnership also allows a large competitive advantage as AvePoint offers the only full suite of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage, and secure data in Microsoft 365. Within the 7mm cloud users, previously mentioned there&#39;s some blockbuster Fortune 500 companies relying on AvePoint&#39;s technology everyday.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/0AjhMOp\">https://imgur.com/a/0AjhMOp</a></p>\n\n<p>3.) Financials and Growth</p>\n\n<p>Full Year Total Revenue for 2020 closed somewhere between $148M and $151M, up 29% year over Year. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short Term Investments total approximately $70M as of December 30, 2020 with a ~14% EBIT margin. The company also remains completely debt-free.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://currently.att.yahoo.com/att/apex-technology-acquisition-corporation-avepoint-120000775.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAJkj9TMthTRpFA4YOKfMXxTJ32_2uIMtn7tqMm5C5AurJm-1jnzqJ8A8u0__GoF71BAC5EIV1TIIcXAZh-jvBC4gdkY0dRBSeAEt46s6XHCyl16vrAhUtkaNwF1JA5Df0kGvKHP-ZxQLlDnqfgPVF_L-UckoGdw4JWb6NlwU3t7\">https://currently.att.yahoo.com/att/apex-technology-acquisition-corporation-avepoint-120000775.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAJkj9TMthTRpFA4YOKfMXxTJ32_2uIMtn7tqMm5C5AurJm-1jnzqJ8A8u0__GoF71BAC5EIV1TIIcXAZh-jvBC4gdkY0dRBSeAEt46s6XHCyl16vrAhUtkaNwF1JA5Df0kGvKHP-ZxQLlDnqfgPVF_L-UckoGdw4JWb6NlwU3t7</a></p>\n\n<p>With an additional $252mm in cash on its balance sheet from the transaction, there will be plenty of room to grow. Some of the avenues AvePoint plans attacking include; selling more to existing customers, increasing SMB footprint, capturing a larger share of the Microsoft Cloud Customer Base (currently only 3% with no meaningful competition in the space), and expanding target industry focus and international targets.</p>\n\n<p>Been holding 200 shares since late November and am shocked this merger isn&#39;t getting more attention. In the year of the SPAC, this one stands out as one of the best. I see at as a great simultaneous growth and value play and wanted to share. Cheers.</p>\n\n<p>Additional Financials:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/V1jZU2r\">https://imgur.com/a/V1jZU2r</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/QQ5A3S6\">https://imgur.com/a/QQ5A3S6</a></p>\n\n<p>Main Sources:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.avepoint.com/pdfs/en/Apex-AvePoint%20Investor%20Presentation_Webcast_Final%20(11.23.2020\">https://cdn.avepoint.com/pdfs/en/Apex-AvePoint%20Investor%20Presentation_Webcast_Final%20(11.23.2020).pdf</a>.pdf)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1777921&amp;owner=exclude\">https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1777921&amp;owner=exclude</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/li2hfz/apxt_the_dark_horse_spac/","title":"APXT - The Dark Horse SPAC","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T13:55:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 13:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c9e04b63-215c-52f9-8fa7-61d47becae4b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/li2hfz/apxt_the_dark_horse_spac/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/li2hfz/apxt_the_dark_horse_spac/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"flynick","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/flynick","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"flynick","score":80,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"APXT - 黑马SPAC","the_new_excerpt":"给任何一个想找一个悄悄飞来的好戏的人。\n让我给你介绍一个今年最好的SPAC，它几乎没有被\n谈到。\n\nApex Technologies / AvePoint Inc.\n\n在2020年11月，最大的微软365数据管理公司AvePoint。\n解决方案提供商...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"APXT - 黑馬SPAC","the_new_excerpt":"給任何一個想找一個悄悄飛來的好戲的人。\n讓我給你介紹一個今年最好的SPAC，它幾乎沒有被\n談到。\n\nApex Technologies / AvePoint Inc.\n\n在2020年11月，最大的微軟365數據管理公司AvePoint。\n解決方案提供商...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c7d4c064-e036-5261-b4cd-2e5fa4c308fe","excerpt":"Source\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/roblox-says-revenue-was-higher-than-reported-pushes-listing-to-march.html]\n\nBasically they're trying to milk as much money out of this listing as possible.\nI mean they deserve it with revenues of $613.9m.\n\nBut it reminds me of Zynga and their fallout with…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/li2g4g/roblox_says_revenue_was_higher_than_previously/","title":"Roblox says revenue was higher than previously reported and pushes direct listing to March","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Roblox称营收高于此前报告，并将直接上市时间推至3月。","the_new_excerpt":"资料来源\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/roblox-says-revenue-was-higher-than-reported-pushes-listing-to-march.html]\n\n基本上他们是想从这次上市中榨取尽可能多的钱。\n我的意思是，他们的收入为6.139亿美元，理应如此。\n\n但这让我想起了Zynga和他们的后遗症... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Roblox稱營收高於此前報告，並將直接上市時間推至3月。","the_new_excerpt":"資料來源\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/roblox-says-revenue-was-higher-than-reported-pushes-listing-to-march.html]\n\n基本上他們是想從這次上市中榨取儘可能多的錢。\n我的意思是，他們的收入爲6.139億美元，理應如此。\n\n但這讓我想起了Zynga和他們的後遺症... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-434657c4-5257-5c02-8001-9f3e3e4550da","excerpt":"The first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in North America has been given the\ngo-ahead by Canada’s financial regulator.\n\nAccording to a decision document on Thursday, the receipt of approval from the\nOntario Securities Commission was filed under a Multilateral Instrument passport\nsystem in…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhzl35/first_north_american_publicly_traded_bitcoin_etf/","title":"First North American Publicly traded Bitcoin ETF Approved by Canadian Securities Regulator","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 12, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"首只北美公开交易的比特币ETF获加拿大证券监管机构批准。","the_new_excerpt":"北美首只比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）已获。\n获得加拿大金融监管机构的批准。\n\n据周四的一份决定文件显示，收到加拿大金融监管机构的批准后，加拿大金融监管机构将对该\n安大略省证券委员会是根据多边文书护照提交的。\n系统在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"首隻北美公開交易的比特幣ETF獲加拿大證券監管機構批准。","the_new_excerpt":"北美首隻比特幣交易所交易基金（ETF）已獲。\n獲得加拿大金融監管機構的批准。\n\n據週四的一份決定文件顯示，收到加拿大金融監管機構的批准後，加拿大金融監管機構將對該\n安大略省證券委員會是根據多邊文書護照提交的。\n系統在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-c9e04b63-215c-52f9-8fa7-61d47becae4b","previousId":"RedditPost-c7d4c064-e036-5261-b4cd-2e5fa4c308fe","nextId":"RedditPost-434657c4-5257-5c02-8001-9f3e3e4550da","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/li2hfz/apxt_the_dark_horse_spac/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
