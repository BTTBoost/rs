There were many like minded people and the trade was going very well until August and September. I lost 50% of that port due to the trade. Probably a little more. At this point, I held through, and averaged down, and have made my losses back plus profits.</p>\n\n<p>This post is a reminder that being early is the same as being wrong. </p>\n\n<p>Now that oil is back on a tear, I&#39;d like to remind oil bulls to trim down. I&#39;m not all out of the trade at all, but I&#39;m playing ETFs and 2 individual stocks (Exxon, Devon.)</p>\n\n<p>I think that oil may still go up in the near term towards winter, and I believe even the medium term oil looks good. But I still think at these prices, we should not be entering any new trades with money we aren&#39;t prepared to lose. I&#39;ve traded oil quite a bit the passed year, and I&#39;ve gotten saved by my own conviction. If you plan on trading commodities, I recommend a level head and sound due diligence. </p>\n\n<p>Again, being early is no different from being wrong. I was right, but my options thought I wasn&#39;t, and I saw a -50%. That was scary, but I still knew that the fundamentals of this oil rally would unltimately bring prices up. Looking at wti go from 80 to 68, was gut wrenching, and holding my January calls through it was almost stupid, but conviction and experience and knowledge of this painful trade is what ended up making me my money back on it. </p>\n\n<p>If you are a trader of commodities, be careful. Even though I made my money back, I&#39;m not sure if it was worth the receding hairline. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, oil was a great trade, and I&#39;m happy I was in it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qadzhm/im_a_guy_who_posted_about_oil_3_months_ago_sadly/","title":"I'm a guy who posted about oil 3 months ago, sadly.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-18T08:44:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-18 08:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qadzhm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qadzhm/im_a_guy_who_posted_about_oil_3_months_ago_sadly/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qadzhm/im_a_guy_who_posted_about_oil_3_months_ago_sadly/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"third_legatron","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/third_legatron","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"third_legatron","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"3ヶ月前に悲しくもオイルについて投稿した者です。","the_new_excerpt":"私は3ヶ月ほど前、このサブサイトでオイルについての記事をおそらく一日おきに書いていました。\nに戻ってきました。気の合う仲間がたくさんいて、8月、9月まではトレードがとてもうまくいっていました。\n8月と9月まではとても順調でした。そのポートの50％をトレードで失ってしまいました。おそらく、もう少し\nそれ以上かもしれません。この時点で、私は持ちこたえて、平均的に下げていったのですが......。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我是一个3个月前发过关于石油的帖子的人，很遗憾。","the_new_excerpt":"我曾经大概每隔一天就在这个子网站上发表关于石油的帖子，大约3个月前\n归来。这里有很多志同道合的人，交易一直进行得很好，直到8月和9月。\n八月和九月。由于交易，我失去了那个港口的50%。可能是\n多一点。在这一点上，我坚持了下来，并且平均下来，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我是一個3個月前發過關於石油的帖子的人，很遺憾。","the_new_excerpt":"我曾經大概每隔一天就在這個子網站上發表關於石油的帖子，大約3個月前\n歸來。這裏有很多志同道合的人，交易一直進行得很好，直到8月和9月。\n八月和九月。由於交易，我失去了那個港口的50%。可能是\n多一點。在這一點上，我堅持了下來，並且平均下來，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qahjx2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qahjx2/the_worlds_first_generative_art_nft_p2e_project/","title":"The World’s First Generative Art NFT & P2E Project in Space!","date":"October 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"世界初のジェネレーティブアートNFT＆P2Eプロジェクトを宇宙で実現!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"世界上第一个在太空中的生成艺术NFT和P2E项目!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"世界上第一個在太空中的生成藝術NFT和P2E項目!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qacosj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qacosj/happy_halloween_on_the_moon/","title":"Happy Halloween… on the moon!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 18, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ハッピーハロウィン...月面で!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"万圣节快乐......在月亮上!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"萬聖節快樂......在月亮上!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qadzhm","previousId":"RedditPost-qahjx2","nextId":"RedditPost-qacosj","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qadzhm/im_a_guy_who_posted_about_oil_3_months_ago_sadly/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
