I make 70k a year, and have about 36 k in savings. I want to start putting money into individual stocks because a lot of my friends have made good returns this way. Doing so will help me get to my goal faster. The problem is that I don’t know where to start. I would really love to hear some thoughts from the more experienced people here.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, I am not very knowledgeable about the stock market. I only know the basic principles about it. I am young so I can take a few risks. I am not very numerical, so I want to find experts to follow. I have seen some impressive analyses on YouTube but I don’t know how credible these people are.<br/>\nHow do you know which stocks are the best ones to buy? I have heard that some investing apps let you copy trades of the pros. I wonder if this strategy works? A friend of mine said he uses<a href=\"https://www.wallstrank.com/?r=1\"> this</a> to get some good ideas. It seems like a useful tool.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that every person invests based on their unique circumstances. However, any advice would be appreciated. Thank you all for your help!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qclwrn/help_me_start_my_investment_journey/","title":"Help me start my investment journey","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-21T09:13:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-21 09:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qclwrn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qclwrn/help_me_start_my_investment_journey/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qclwrn/help_me_start_my_investment_journey/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"BuenaSmaily","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BuenaSmaily","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BuenaSmaily","score":348,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の投資の旅立ちをサポート","the_new_excerpt":"私は来年31歳になりますが、まだ賃貸に住んでいます。年後には家を買いたいと思っています。\n年後には家を買いたいと思っています。年収は7万円で、貯金は3万6千円ほどあります。私が望むのは\n多くの友人がこの方法で利益を上げているので、私は個別株にお金を入れ始めたいと思っています。\nこの方法で多くの友人が良い利益を得ているからです。そうすることで、私の目標を達成することができます...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"帮助我开始我的投资之旅","the_new_excerpt":"我明年就31岁了，我还在租房。我想在未来两年内买房。\n未来两年内买房。我年薪7万，有大约3.6万的存款。我想\n我想开始把钱投入到个人股票中，因为我的很多朋友都在今年取得了良好的回报。\n好的回报。这样做将帮助我实现我的目标...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"幫助我開始我的投資之旅","the_new_excerpt":"我明年就31歲了，我還在租房。我想在未來兩年內買房。\n未來兩年內買房。我年薪7萬，有大約3.6萬的存款。我想\n我想開始把錢投入到個人股票中，因爲我的很多朋友都在今年取得了良好的回報。\n好的回報。這樣做將幫助我實現我的目標...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qciuwi","excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-lies-beneath-hidden-debt-fears-feed-chinas-property-woes-2021-10-20/\n\n> \"Nearly every developer has borrowings in disguise.
