We&#39;d get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We&#39;d get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.</p>\n\n<p>The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I&#39;d read about the different bets. &quot;Smart&quot; bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).</p>\n\n<p>The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I&#39;ll never forget the rush.</p>\n\n<p>I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He&#39;d say &quot;I just taught you a very valuable lesson.&quot; He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you&#39;ll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn&#39;t understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can&#39;t even remember.</p>\n\n<p>What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I&#39;m still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don&#39;t go to the casino anymore, but I&#39;ve got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I&#39;ve caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn&#39;t possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells &quot;7 out!&quot; and just like that, I&#39;m back to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. &quot;Just let it happen one more time. I won&#39;t be greedy THIS time and I&#39;ll stop when I hit 50k.&quot; I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that&#39;ll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I&#39;m on my way out to the car and I feel like I&#39;ve been punched in the gut. Again.</p>\n\n<p>Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You&#39;re playing baccarat. If you&#39;ve never heard of it, it&#39;s what James Bond plays in the old movies. It&#39;s about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you&#39;re betting on which one wins before anything happens. There&#39;s no actual skill and it&#39;s the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.</p>\n\n<p>The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you&#39;re going to switch machines because the other ones are &quot;due&quot;. You&#39;re looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.</p>\n\n<p>The people saying &quot;If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!&quot; You&#39;re the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you&#39;re begging everyone else for a loan.</p>\n\n<p>Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying &quot;tomorrow is the day.&quot; Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they&#39;re waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can&#39;t trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Screenshots from the worst 40 minutes of my financial life <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/MlTRJmx\">https://imgur.com/a/MlTRJmx</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: JFC, some of you are takin WSB way too seriously. You should not be using reddit for DD. Also, this is not financial advice. Don&#39;t take financial advice from someone who tells you stories about chasing highs at casinos.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: This is WSB, my dudes. I&#39;m glad most of you were entertained by my story. For the few of you who got that worked up by a random stranger on the internet telling you that he&#39;s a degenerate, you may actually have a problem. <a href=\"https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/\">https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfs22f/why_ill_never_stop_buying_gme_and_why_you/","title":"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T15:19:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 15:19","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"49155b2d-6eb8-5546-b419-b3d155bdb717","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfs22f/why_ill_never_stop_buying_gme_and_why_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfs22f/why_ill_never_stop_buying_gme_and_why_you/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/6_a4pDTevpICRbpJK_lDwqjKYwgj8MGS08PPypRxMbs.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fba81b05a83fba1b4665f5f55613600e56703c84","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"mt4h","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mt4h","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mt4h","score":2642,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么我永远不会停止购买GME，以及为什么你可能应该停止购买。","the_new_excerpt":"当我18岁的时候，有一个赌场大约2个小时的路程，在我的保留地上。\n可以进入。我们会在周五晚上拿到钱，去附近的加油站加油\n这将兑现的薪水，堆到我的蹩脚的小福特，然后使。\n开车。我们会在午夜之前到达那里，每个人都... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼我永遠不會停止購買GME，以及爲什麼你可能應該停止購買。","the_new_excerpt":"當我18歲的時候，有一個賭場大約2個小時的路程，在我的保留地上。\n可以進入。我們會在週五晚上拿到錢，去附近的加油站加油\n這將兌現的薪水，堆到我的蹩腳的小福特，然後使。\n開車。我們會在午夜之前到達那裏，每個人都... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e3037c7c-14cb-579c-a4f9-e6c38ba5e878","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfzswq/holding_gme_be_like/","title":"🚀 Holding $GME be like","date":"February 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"🚀持有$GME就像......。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"🚀持有$GME就像......。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-747deef4-725c-545b-80e8-736161856759","excerpt":"I’m gone for one month, done nothing but wank , drink and work like 70 hours at\nmy day job , all been one fucking blur\n\nI hear this game shit and ignore it , fucking Normies .
