I saw the quote in the title by the legendary investor Warren Buffett and it got me thinking. I understand what he means by this quote but I&#39;m tempted everyday by new &quot;HOT&quot; stocks with very high earning potential in the future. I&#39;m more on the conservative side when it comes to investing and it gives me a sense of security when I have my portfolio diversified (90K total invested into 13 different stocks). One of my major concern is that you can believe in a stock after careful research and analysis but at the end of the day it&#39;s how the other investors and market as a whole values the stock, which you have no control over. </p>\n\n<p>I know there are many smart and successful investors in here so I would like to hear your opinion on the question. How diversified is too much diversification? Would you only stick to what you know best or expand to look for undervalued companies for potential gains? </p>\n\n<p>Anything helps, thank you in advance!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lmewlu/wide_diversification_is_only_required_when/","title":"\"Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.\" Quote by Warren Buffett","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T14:06:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 14:06","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1c765305-adab-5c44-8aaf-1adf50c8f7f4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmewlu/wide_diversification_is_only_required_when/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmewlu/wide_diversification_is_only_required_when/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Asbbbb","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Asbbbb","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Asbbbb","score":60,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"只有当投资者不明白自己在做什么时，才需要广泛分散投资。\" 沃伦-巴菲特的名言","the_new_excerpt":"希望大家都能有个好心情。我看到标题中的一句话，由\n传奇投资人沃伦-巴菲特，这让我思考。我明白他\n这句话的手段，但我的诱惑，每天新的 \"HOT \"的股票，非常高的 \"HOT\"。\n挣钱的潜力在未来。我是比较保守的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"只有當投資者不明白自己在做什麼時，才需要廣泛分散投資。\" 沃倫-巴菲特的名言","the_new_excerpt":"希望大家都能有個好心情。我看到標題中的一句話，由\n傳奇投資人沃倫-巴菲特，這讓我思考。我明白他\n這句話的手段，但我的誘惑，每天新的 \"HOT \"的股票，非常高的 \"HOT\"。\n掙錢的潛力在未來。我是比較保守的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5c845a0c-de60-53ce-8943-797f0cb161c7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llx7io/wsb_bagholders_find_some_irregularities/","title":"WSB bagholders find some irregularities...","date":"February 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WSB袋主发现一些违规...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"WSB袋主發現一些違規...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-af82ae84-6ff0-55be-b623-7324e9626654","excerpt":"Look, I get that some of you genuinely tried to transfer to another broker, but\nthat legitimate gambling addiction that you have to the stonk market prevented\nyou from closing out all your positions and letting your trades settle (even\nthough if you did you probably wouldn't have lost 80% by…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lme4i6/youre_unironically_retarded_if_youre_still_using/","title":"You're unironically retarded if you're still using Robinhood","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 18, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"如果你还在用罗宾汉的身份，你就会被讽刺为弱智了","the_new_excerpt":"你看，我得到，你们中的一些人真正试图转移到另一个经纪人，但。\n你对石器市场的合法赌瘾被阻止了。\n你不会平仓所有的头寸，并让你的交易结算（即使是你自己的交易）。\n虽然如果你这样做，你可能不会失去80％的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你還在用羅賓漢的身份，你就會被諷刺爲弱智了","the_new_excerpt":"你看，我得到，你們中的一些人真正試圖轉移到另一個經紀人，但。\n你對石器市場的合法賭癮被阻止了。\n你不會平倉所有的頭寸，並讓你的交易結算（即使是你自己的交易）。\n雖然如果你這樣做，你可能不會失去80％的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-1c765305-adab-5c44-8aaf-1adf50c8f7f4","previousId":"RedditPost-5c845a0c-de60-53ce-8943-797f0cb161c7","nextId":"RedditPost-af82ae84-6ff0-55be-b623-7324e9626654","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lmewlu/wide_diversification_is_only_required_when/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
