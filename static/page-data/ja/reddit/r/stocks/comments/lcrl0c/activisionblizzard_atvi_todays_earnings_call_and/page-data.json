Reports are saying $3.05 billion versus $2.78 billion expected, and earnings per share: $1.21 versus $1.17 expected:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html</a></p>\n\n<p>I don’t own any at the moment, but I wish I had made a major investment. I had been filtering stocks, and a few stats about Activision stuck out to me. Activision has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Over 70% gross profit margin</li>\n<li>Over 30% growth in earnings per share this quarter</li>\n<li>Over 30% growth in sales this quarter</li>\n<li>Positive sales growth over past five years</li>\n<li>P/E under 40</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Only five other large cap stocks share these characteristics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alexandria Real Estate - ARE</li>\n<li>Facebook - FB<br/></li>\n<li>Horizon Therapeutics - HZNP</li>\n<li>KKR &amp; Co. - KKR</li>\n<li>Vertex Pharma - VRTX<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Every other stock with those growth, sales, and margin numbers are stocks with insanely high P/E ratios, like Etsy (123) or NovoCure (2486 lol). But you’ve got this group of stocks with what looks like value P/E ratios under 40: Activision, Facebook, two medical tech companies, and two financial companies. And all of them are generally regarded as strong buys. </p>\n\n<p>But there’s something unique in my mind about Activision. Biotech is volatile, prone to setbacks on a technical or regulatory level even before you start talking business fundamentals. And I know the finance companies are good buys. But Activision’s business model seems more insulated from the some of the pitfalls of the market. It was a strong COVID business and not one that I personally see taking a post-COVID recovery hit. </p>\n\n<p>This is one of those rare companies where the numbers looks fantastic, I’m familiar with the industry, and I like the company’s products. I’ll probably get invested soon. Just going to wait to see how its price responds to the earnings call. I&#39;d be very interested to hear what others think.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcrl0c/activisionblizzard_atvi_todays_earnings_call_and/","title":"ACTIVISION/BLIZZARD (ATVI): Today’s earnings call and some unique numbers make this is an interesting stock I wish I had jumped on.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T05:33:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 05:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c32fef24-2c38-518d-a08c-092f7e90ea1d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcrl0c/activisionblizzard_atvi_todays_earnings_call_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcrl0c/activisionblizzard_atvi_todays_earnings_call_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"x--BANKS--x","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/x--BANKS--x","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"x--BANKS--x","score":67,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ACTIVISION/BLIZZARD（ATVI）。今天的财报电话和一些独特的数字 使得这只股票很有趣，我希望我已经跳了进去。","the_new_excerpt":"眼下，动视正在进行季度财报电话会议。报道称\n30.5亿美元，预期27.8亿美元，每股收益。$1.21\n而预期为1.17美元。\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html\n\n我现在还没有，但我... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ACTIVISION/BLIZZARD（ATVI）。今天的財報電話和一些獨特的數字 使得這隻股票很有趣，我希望我已經跳了進去。","the_new_excerpt":"眼下，動視正在進行季度財報電話會議。報道稱\n30.5億美元，預期27.8億美元，每股收益。$1.21\n而預期爲1.17美元。\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-q4-earnings-2020-210514360.html\n\n我現在還沒有，但我... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6ab8aa9b-d014-5d50-919c-3f054396cd22","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpsl0/ive_been_working_on_a_wsb_desk_toy_you_can_swap/","title":"I've been working on a WSB desk toy.
