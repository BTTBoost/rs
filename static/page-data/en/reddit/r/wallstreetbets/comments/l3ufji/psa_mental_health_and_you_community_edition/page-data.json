I haven’t seen anything like it.</p>\n\n<p>Last week was exhausting (and I was mainly just watching...)</p>\n\n<p>No doubt people are drained from stress, flying, falling, fear, ecstasy. This is especially true if you’ve partaken in drugs, alcohol, sex. No judgement, I just want you to do your laundry after the ecstasy to prepare for whatever is to come. Blood or angels. </p>\n\n<p>Many no doubt have wins and losses, and there is a huge amount of depletion that occurs inside of the brain and body after serious events. People need to refuel. It will help sharpen you for the coming week. </p>\n\n<p>Tips: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Go for a walk/stroll outside. Smell anything out there. </p></li>\n<li><p>Eat a balanced diet today. Load up on veggies and fruits. Drink a lot of water. A lot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make dinner with your family. </p></li>\n<li><p>Crack jokes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Take a cold shower (“Wim Hof method”).</p></li>\n<li><p>Express and feel gratitude, starting with basic things like the fact you have eyes and can see. Try for 3 things, even if you are down. </p></li>\n<li><p>Search your maps for a float therapy (“isolation tank”, “floating”, “sensory deprivation”). This usually costs $70 and is a pinnacle experience. Trust me. I’ve been floating for years and you bet your ass I went today.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you can’t do the above, meditate.</p></li>\n<li><p>Read a book</p></li>\n<li><p>Draw</p></li>\n<li><p>Pray <a href=\"/u/SweetEmbraceableYou\">u/SweetEmbraceableYou</a></p></li>\n<li><p>If you have trouble sleeping: Chamomile tea, and Valerian Root or Melatonin <a href=\"/u/2ticketstotendytown\">u/2ticketstotendytown</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Yoga <a href=\"/u/Goin_off\">u/Goin_off</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Wear comfy socks.

It has no boundaries. You need to have a fresh mind and body to take on the volatility and pure Gs of a rocket ship. It is abso-fucking-lutely terrifying for some people. Whatever plays you’re making, please go into the coming week with a clear mind. I especially recommend floating in a sensory deprivation tank. </p>\n\n<p>Share your ideas in the comments, and when inspired, go do that thing. Please. For yourself. 👊</p>\n\n<p>God speed, retards 🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","title":"PSA: Mental Health and YOU (Community edition)","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T17:20:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 17:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c28abc75-c371-5ba8-a033-084dbf063a9f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Macnamera","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Macnamera","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Macnamera","score":1646,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"公益广告：心理健康与你(社区版)","the_new_excerpt":"我希望这个帖子是合适的。我还没有见过这样的事情。\n\n上周真是累死人了（我主要就是看......）。\n\n毫无疑问，人们因为压力、飞翔、坠落、恐惧、狂喜而疲惫不堪。这就是\n尤其是当你参与了毒品，酒精，性行为的时候。没有判断，我只是\n要你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"公益廣告：心理健康與你(社區版)","the_new_excerpt":"我希望這個帖子是合適的。我還沒有見過這樣的事情。\n\n上週真是累死人了（我主要就是看......）。\n\n毫無疑問，人們因爲壓力、飛翔、墜落、恐懼、狂喜而疲憊不堪。這就是\n尤其是當你參與了毒品，酒精，性行爲的時候。沒有判斷，我只是\n要你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1353332999912357889","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1353332999912357889","title":"‘When older people are upset, you fix it’ — this Florida journalist has helped hundreds book COVID-19 vaccinations https://t.co/aQQ4vHmvxf","date":"January 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"老年人不高兴了，你就解决它\"--这位佛罗里达州的记者已经帮助数百人预订了COVID-19疫苗https://t.co/aQQ4vHmvxf。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"老年人不高興了，你就解決它\"--這位佛羅里達州的記者已經幫助數百人預訂了COVID-19疫苗https://t.co/aQQ4vHmvxf。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-5641ff84-4f6f-5501-b296-0b77e13868b5","excerpt":"Would not be surprised in the least if any of the money managers shorting GME\nfile some kind of bogus lawsuit (stock manipulation, collusion, etc) over the\nweekend (even while knowing they would lose or at minimum gain nothing from it)\nin hopes that media will run with it and scare retail off again.…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3qsa6/lawsuits_will_be_filed_as_scare_tactics/","title":"Lawsuits Will be Filed as scare tactics","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 24, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"诉讼将是恐吓手段","the_new_excerpt":"如果有资金经理做空GME，一点也不奇怪。\n提起某种虚假诉讼（股票操纵、串通等），对。\n周末\n希望媒体能顺势而为，把零售业再次吓跑....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"訴訟將是恐嚇手段","the_new_excerpt":"如果有資金經理做空GME，一點也不奇怪。\n提起某種虛假訴訟（股票操縱、串通等），對。\n週末\n希望媒體能順勢而爲，把零售業再次嚇跑....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-c28abc75-c371-5ba8-a033-084dbf063a9f","previousId":"TweetPost-1353332999912357889","nextId":"RedditPost-5641ff84-4f6f-5501-b296-0b77e13868b5","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ufji/psa_mental_health_and_you_community_edition/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
