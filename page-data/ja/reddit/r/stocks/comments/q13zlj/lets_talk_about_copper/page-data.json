Right now companies are striving to meet the supply demands but with some setbacks. Just recently both Codelco and BHP were able to pacify labor tensions with one ending a strike with their plant workers, and the other one accepting a wage proposal for their union members. This is an important issue, since these two companies are the top producers of copper and are all located in the top copper-producing nation, Chile.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this, there is still a lot of speculation if there will be enough copper in the future. Bigger companies are continuously producing and contributing to meet with demands, but there are also a lot of junior companies that are continuously exploring their sites for more of this mineral, with some of them starting their drilling activities, hoping to achieve production in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>Just recently West Mining Corp. (CSE: WEST) (OTC: WESMF) started their 2021 diamond drilling program on the Kena Copper Zone area of its 100% owned Kena gold and copper project in southeastern British Columbia. Three Valley Copper (TVC), on the other hand, just announced their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. They also announced the commencement of their 2021 near mine exploration drilling program on the Minera Tres Valles property near Salamanca, Region de Coquimbo, Chile, from which they own 91.1%.</p>\n\n<p>However, just recently, it has been released that copper prices fell on Tuesday due to a debt crisis at property giant China Evergrande Group, fueling worries about the demand for the metal. Copper for delivery in December fell 0.6% from Monday’s settlement price, touching $4.090 per pound ($8,998 per tonne) midday Tuesday on the Comex market in New York.</p>\n\n<p>From hitting above US$9,000 per ton in February this year for the first time since September 2011, there are a lot of speculations on whether this price spike is just temporary or will it be a long-term one and copper will be a commodity supercycle. With this happening with China, how will it affect companies? Will prices continue to go down or will it be able to recover and increase even more?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q13zlj/lets_talk_about_copper/","title":"Let’s talk about copper","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-04T13:43:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-04 13:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q13zlj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q13zlj/lets_talk_about_copper/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q13zlj/lets_talk_about_copper/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"BarTraditional6305","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BarTraditional6305","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BarTraditional6305","score":191,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"銅について話そう","the_new_excerpt":"現在、世界で最も銅を消費しているのは中国であり、多くの産業に使われる重要な金属であるため、中国は銅を蓄えています。\n銅は多くの産業で使用される重要な金属であるため、中国は銅を蓄えています。\n現在、企業は供給需要を満たすために努力していますが、いくつかの問題があります。\n現在、各社は供給需要を満たすために努力していますが、いくつかの問題があります。つい最近、コデルコ社とBHP社が労働者をなだめることに成功しました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们来谈谈铜的问题","the_new_excerpt":"中国目前是世界上最大的铜消费国，他们一直在储存铜，因为铜是一种重要的金属，用于许多行业。\n因为它是一种重要的金属，被用于很多行业。\n目前，公司正在努力满足供应需求，但也有一些\n挫折。就在最近，Codelco公司和BHP公司都能够安抚劳工...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們來談談銅的問題","the_new_excerpt":"中國目前是世界上最大的銅消費國，他們一直在儲存銅，因爲銅是一種重要的金屬，用於許多行業。\n因爲它是一種重要的金屬，被用於很多行業。\n目前，公司正在努力滿足供應需求，但也有一些\n挫折。就在最近，Codelco公司和BHP公司都能夠安撫勞工...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q0y9fz","excerpt":"Windows 11 will have a sleeker layout, more detailed widgets, an updated\nMicrosoft Store, and support for Android apps.\n\nThe rollout of Windows 11 will occur in phases, just like previous Windows 10\nfeature updates.
