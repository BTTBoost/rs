Everything seemed super expensive to me at the time, GOOGL was 1500, MSFT was 200, NVDA 600, COST 300, etc. I didn’t think I could afford them and the many others and so I turned my eye towards “cheaper” stocks that cost in the 10-100 range. Well disclaimer they did not do so hot over the next few months. To my frustration these “cheap” stocks always tanked hard on red days and barely budged on green days. The “expensive” stocks however did very well and continue to keep running, hitting ATHs almost every day. \nI now wish I wasn’t put off by seeing such large numbers, or someone had told me not to worry about price, but I guess thats just beginner lessons and it took me a while to grasp the concept of how the stock market works.</p>\n\n<p>FYI my background is in medicine so I came pretty unprepared and made a lot of mistakes as a beginner investor, most notably buying penny stocks and SPACS thinking I was picking them up for cheap, and of course falling for the WSB memes (but they made me feel so alive!) Anyways just wanted to share my experience! Not feeling FOMO at all 😅</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oqdgo8/what_ive_learned_from_buying_cheap_stocks/","title":"What I’ve learned from buying “cheap” stocks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-24T02:36:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-24 02:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"47734809-c869-5c79-a736-6b7e8a49006d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oqdgo8/what_ive_learned_from_buying_cheap_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oqdgo8/what_ive_learned_from_buying_cheap_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"weddingphotosMIA","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/weddingphotosMIA","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"weddingphotosMIA","score":207,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"安い \"株を買ってわかったこと","the_new_excerpt":"私は比較的新しい投資家で、半年前に市場が上昇したときに株を買い始めました。\n市場が上昇していた半年前に株を買い始めた比較的新しい投資家です。当時の私にはすべてが超高価に見えました。\nが1500、MSFTが200、NVDAが600、COSTが300など。自分には買えないと思いました。\n私はそれらの製品や他の多くの製品を買う余裕がないと思い、目を向けたのです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我从购买 \"廉价 \"股票中学到的东西","the_new_excerpt":"我是一个相对较新的投资者，6个月前开始购买股票，当时市场正在反弹。\n市场正在回升。在我看来，当时所有的东西都超级贵，GOOGL\n是1500，MSFT是200，NVDA是600，COST是300，等等。我不认为我能够负担得起\n他们和其他许多人，所以我把目光转向了......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我從購買 \"廉價 \"股票中學到的東西","the_new_excerpt":"我是一個相對較新的投資者，6個月前開始購買股票，當時市場正在反彈。\n市場正在回升。在我看來，當時所有的東西都超級貴，GOOGL\n是1500，MSFT是200，NVDA是600，COST是300，等等。我不認爲我能夠負擔得起\n他們和其他許多人，所以我把目光轉向了......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-640f10d2-fcf0-56cc-a77b-207be0d56bd1","excerpt":"What are you thoughts on which company is a better investement for next 12\nmonths?\n\nHonestly I do prefer CloudFlare both as a company and a platform, but compared\nto Fastly it's extramely overvalued.\n\nCloudflare is currently valued at ratio of 79 at Price/Sales ratio vs Fastly at\n19.\n\nCloudflare…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oq23bj/cloudflare_vs_fastly/","title":"CloudFlare vs Fastly?","date":"July 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CloudFlare vs Fastly?","the_new_excerpt":"今後12ヶ月間、どの会社に投資するのが良いか、あなたの考えを聞かせてください。\nどの会社が良いと思いますか？\n\n正直なところ、会社としてもプラットフォームとしてもCloudFlareの方が好きですが、Fastlyと比べると\nFastlyと比較すると、非常に過大評価されています。\n\nクラウドフレアは現在、価格／売上比が79であるのに対し、Fastlyは19です。\n19.\n\nクラウドフレア...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CloudFlare vs Fastly?","the_new_excerpt":"你对哪家公司在未来12个月内更适合投资有什么看法？\n个月的投资？\n\n老实说，我更喜欢CloudFlare，无论是作为一个公司还是一个平台，但与Fastly相比，它的优势是什么？\n与Fastly相比，它的价值被过度高估了。\n\nCloudflare目前的价格/销售比率为79，而Fastly的价格/销售比率为\n19.\n\nCloudflare...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CloudFlare vs Fastly?","the_new_excerpt":"你對哪家公司在未來12個月內更適合投資有什麼看法？\n個月的投資？\n\n老實說，我更喜歡CloudFlare，無論是作爲一個公司還是一個平臺，但與Fastly相比，它的優勢是什麼？\n與Fastly相比，它的價值被過度高估了。\n\nCloudflare目前的價格/銷售比率爲79，而Fastly的價格/銷售比率爲\n19.\n\nCloudflare...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-8eec8680-cfe5-5373-a3df-dc0a88286399","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oqcvd6/does_half_of_this_really_go_to_tax/","title":"Does half of this really go to tax?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 24, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"このうち半分は本当に税金になるの？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"这其中的一半真的用于税收吗？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"這其中的一半真的用於稅收嗎？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-47734809-c869-5c79-a736-6b7e8a49006d","previousId":"RedditPost-640f10d2-fcf0-56cc-a77b-207be0d56bd1","nextId":"RedditPost-8eec8680-cfe5-5373-a3df-dc0a88286399","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oqdgo8/what_ive_learned_from_buying_cheap_stocks/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
