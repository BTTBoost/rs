The markets have been pretty volatile lately, whipsawing up and down, and nobody seems to know how long that will continue, but it got me thinking about the current trading environment, and thus I was wondering three things:</p>\n\n<p>1) Is this a trading strategy that anyone currently uses? If so, how successful has it been, and how/when do you use it?</p>\n\n<p>2) Is there a source of this type of information that is fairly up to date (futures performance vs day performance)?</p>\n\n<p>3) Would/should this type of investing strategy work in all three market environments (bear, bull, crab/kangaroo), and if so/not, why so/not?</p>\n\n<p>I know that overall performance in a buy-and-hold portfolio wouldn&#39;t be meaningfully different from this strategy, especially when you take into account capital gains taxes and transactions costs and so on, but in volatile markets, or for shorter-term traders, I wonder what this sub thinks of this strategy, even used for an entire index like the S&amp;P 500.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/njlara/does_the_market_still_do_better_overnight_than/","title":"Does the market (still) do better overnight than during the days?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-24T13:22:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-24 13:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a58633b9-bfab-53f8-aa6d-6be43db2fbef","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/njlara/does_the_market_still_do_better_overnight_than/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/njlara/does_the_market_still_do_better_overnight_than/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Phynaes","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Phynaes","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Phynaes","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"マーケットは（やはり）日中よりも夜の方が良いのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"ここにブックマークしておいた記事を読み返してみると\n[https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/125340/why-do-most-of-the-stock-markets-gains-occur-overnight-it-has-an-overall-loss]\nその記事では、少なくともその時点までの傾向として、ほとんどすべての\nその記事では、少なくともその時点までの傾向として、市場のほとんどすべての利益が一夜にして発生するのとは対照的に、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"市场（仍然）比白天做得更好吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我正在重读我在这里收藏的一个帖子\n[https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/125340/why-do-most-of-the-stock-markets-gains-occur-overnight-it-has-an-overall-loss]\n该文章讨论了一种趋势，至少在这一点上，几乎所有的\n市场的收益是在一夜之间发生的，而不是......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場（仍然）比白天做得更好嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我正在重讀我在這裏收藏的一個帖子\n[https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/125340/why-do-most-of-the-stock-markets-gains-occur-overnight-it-has-an-overall-loss]\n該文章討論了一種趨勢，至少在這一點上，幾乎所有的\n市場的收益是在一夜之間發生的，而不是......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1396786966486822912","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1396786966486822912","title":"New covid-19 cases in the US are now down 90% from their peak in January, lowest levels since last June. 🙏 https://t.co/Hj0KZZZBju","date":"May 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国におけるコビド19の新規感染者数は、1月のピーク時から90％減少し、昨年6月以来の低水準となっている。🙏 https://t.co/Hj0KZZZBju","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国新的covid-19病例现在比1月份的峰值下降了90%，是去年6月以来的最低水平。🙏https://t.co/Hj0KZZZBju","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國新的covid-19病例現在比1月份的峯值下降了90%，是去年6月以來的最低水平。🙏https://t.co/Hj0KZZZBju","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ff6b4582-0318-5da6-8f6c-76cc574a52ad","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njvhij/ricki_ticki_tavi_place_your_bets_please/","title":"Ricki Ticki Tavi!
