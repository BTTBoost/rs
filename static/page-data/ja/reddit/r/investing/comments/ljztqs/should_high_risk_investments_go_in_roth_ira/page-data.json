I normally contribute the max to the Roth IRA account, and made the regular account a few years to invest more of my income since the IRAs have a limit.</p>\n\n<p>I recently saw someone actively trade stocks using their IRA account, so I did some reading and searching, and it seems the suggestion is to have long term investment in regular accounts (e.g stable ETFs: VTI, etc), and have more volatile investments in the Roth account, e.g (ARKs, individual stocks, etc).</p>\n\n<p>The reasoning for long term investments in the regular taxable account is because you won&#39;t be cashing in anytime soon, so it&#39;s better there. Whereas with individual stocks, volatile ETFs, you&#39;re more likely to buy/sell, so it&#39;s better if they&#39;re in the IRA accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say my portfolio are as following hypothetically:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>VTI</p></li>\n<li><p>ARKG</p></li>\n<li><p>ICLN</p></li>\n<li><p>DKNG</p></li>\n<li><p>PLTR and so on...</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Should I move my assets around so the taxable brokerage account has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>VTI</p></li>\n<li><p>ICLN</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Whereas the IRA account would have the remaining that I&#39;m more likely to buy/sell often? The downside to actively trading in the IRA account is the contributions cannot be recovered if loss, e.g I lose 500 of the 6000, I cannot put 500 back in for that year.</p>\n\n<p>Or am I just over complicating things? Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ljztqs/should_high_risk_investments_go_in_roth_ira/","title":"Should high risk investments go in Roth IRA","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T03:27:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 03:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ed1f1ada-d9ce-51c7-a7c0-4402d6375eb4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ljztqs/should_high_risk_investments_go_in_roth_ira/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ljztqs/should_high_risk_investments_go_in_roth_ira/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"theirregularbam","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theirregularbam","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"theirregularbam","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"高风险投资该不该进罗斯IRA？","the_new_excerpt":"希望这些问题不要问得太简单!\n\n我在Vanguard有一个Roth IRA和一个普通经纪账户。我通常\n贡献最大的Roth IRA帐户，并使普通帐户的几个。\n年，以投资更多的我的收入，因为IRAs有一个限制。\n\n我最近看到有人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"高風險投資該不該進羅斯IRA？","the_new_excerpt":"希望這些問題不要問得太簡單!\n\n我在Vanguard有一個Roth IRA和一個普通經紀賬戶。我通常\n貢獻最大的Roth IRA帳戶，並使普通帳戶的幾個。\n年，以投資更多的我的收入，因爲IRAs有一個限制。\n\n我最近看到有人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-35537078-475c-5962-b480-92ddad315f71","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljvuld/valentines_gift/","title":"Valentines Gift 🎁","date":"February 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"情人节礼物 🎁 - 情人节礼品","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"情人節禮物 🎁 - 情人節禮品","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-04531778-61e7-5cac-8682-5065977060e0","excerpt":"SRNE - Sorrento Therapeutics.\n\nIt is a biotechnology company with a market cap of $3.9Bln.\n\nThe stock had great volatile sessions during the last months.\n\nAs a lot of its peers, it has a line of COVID-related products, but not only -\nalso has promising products on cancer and pain management.
