For the year, we expect our 2021 footprint additions to exceed last year’s buildout, which was also significant.”</p>\n\n<p>It is a positive development as Amazon still looking for workers and expanding the workforce. The logistic and warehouse networks are in a optimal mode now as Amazon has been invested heavily to fight off the competition. Amazon should be able to absorbs these material and labor costs easily as AWS still growing very fast and provided profit margin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qja05m/amazon_hired_628000_people_but_is_still_short/","title":"Amazon hired 628,000 people but is still short staffed","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-31T02:10:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-31 02:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qja05m","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qja05m/amazon_hired_628000_people_but_is_still_short/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qja05m/amazon_hired_628000_people_but_is_still_short/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"coolcomfort123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/coolcomfort123","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"coolcomfort123","score":339,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アマゾンは62万8千人を雇用したが、まだ人手不足である","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/amazon-added-628-000-workers-worldwide-over-the-last-18-months-but-is-still-feeling-labor-constraints-11635519252\n\n\"第3四半期には、新施設の建設およびオープンに向けて強力に前進し、その結果\nその結果、パンデミックが始まって以来、初めて...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"亚马逊雇用了62.8万人，但仍然人手不足","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/amazon-added-628-000-workers-worldwide-over-the-last-18-months-but-is-still-feeling-labor-constraints-11635519252\n\n\"我们在第三季度在建设和开放新设施方面取得了强有力的进展，因此\n自大流行病开始以来，我们第一次不再...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亞馬遜僱用了62.8萬人，但仍然人手不足","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/amazon-added-628-000-workers-worldwide-over-the-last-18-months-but-is-still-feeling-labor-constraints-11635519252\n\n\"我們在第三季度在建設和開放新設施方面取得了強有力的進展，因此\n自大流行病開始以來，我們第一次不再...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qjc2d6","excerpt":"https://insideevs.com/news/544452/lucid-air-customer-deliveries-begins\n[https://insideevs.com/news/544452/lucid-air-customer-deliveries-begins/]\n\nFirst Lucid Air Dream Edition cars were handed over at the Dream Delivery event\nin California.\n\nAs promised, today Lucid has officially started the first…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qjc2d6/lucid_air_customer_deliveries_officially_begin/","title":"Lucid Air Customer Deliveries Officially Begin","date":"October 31, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Lucid Airのお客様への納入が正式に開始されました。","the_new_excerpt":"https://insideevs.com/news/544452/lucid-air-customer-deliveries-begins\n[https://insideevs.com/news/544452/lucid-air-customer-deliveries-begins/]\n\n夢のお届けイベントでLucid Air Dream Editionの初号機がお渡しされました\nカリフォルニアで開催されたドリームデリバリーイベントで\n\nお約束通り、本日よりLucidは正式に最初の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Lucid Air客户交付正式开始","the_new_excerpt":"https://insideevs.com/news/544452/lucid-air-customer-deliveries-begins\n[https://insideevs.com/news/544452/lucid-air-customer-deliveries-begins/]\n\n第一批Lucid Air梦想版汽车在加州的梦想交付活动中交接。\n在加利福尼亚。\n\n正如承诺的那样，今天Lucid已经正式开始第一批...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Lucid Air客戶交付正式開始","the_new_excerpt":"https://insideevs.com/news/544452/lucid-air-customer-deliveries-begins\n[https://insideevs.com/news/544452/lucid-air-customer-deliveries-begins/]\n\n第一批Lucid Air夢想版汽車在加州的夢想交付活動中交接。\n在加利福尼亞。\n\n正如承諾的那樣，今天Lucid已經正式開始第一批...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qje6ql","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qje6ql/jack_would_like_to_thank_amzn_spy_tsla_and_gme/","title":"Jack would like to thank AMZN SPY TSLA and GME for sponsoring his halloween costume this year","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 31, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Jackは、今年のハロウィーンの衣装をスポンサーしてくれたAMZN SPY TSLAとGMEに感謝します。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"杰克要感谢AMZN SPY TSLA和GME赞助了他今年的万圣节服装。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"傑克要感謝AMZN SPY TSLA和GME贊助了他今年的萬聖節服裝。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qja05m","previousId":"RedditPost-qjc2d6","nextId":"RedditPost-qje6ql","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qja05m/amazon_hired_628000_people_but_is_still_short/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
