What respondents are saying (ISM Manufacturing Index)\n\n *…","body":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>See my prior post for a primer on how I monitor supply-chain disruptions:</strong>  <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/prfsi4/how_to_monitor_the_supply_chain_disruptions/\">How to monitor the supply chain disruptions : stocks (reddit.com)</a> </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. What respondents are saying (</strong><strong><em>ISM Manufacturing Index</em></strong><strong>)</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> “Many electronic components and assemblies shortages showing up (due to) port issues, lack of containers and other issues. Problematic, but nothing completely shut down yet. Watching COVID-19 restrictions country by country.” </li>\n<li> “In the U.S., labor availability is the most significant supply challenge for our company, with raw materials just behind. Plastic resin, polyurethanes, small-volume steel purchases and electronics are the biggest material challenges.” </li>\n<li> “Ocean freight delays creating disruptions in many areas. Southeast Asia supply continues to be challenged due to COVID-19 outbreaks.” </li>\n<li> “Customer demand continues to swell as we prepare for the fourth quarter, and overall growth has been extremely good for the year. Supply chain concerns are growing beyond electronics and chips into most other commodities. Lead times are extending, shipping lanes are slowing, and we will not see an end to this in 2021.” </li>\n<li> “Our company’s entire supply chain continues to have significant challenges getting manpower, which is impacting production of parts and ability to meet daily build schedules. Additionally, the logistics problems — especially port delays and a shortage of shipping containers — are significantly impacting inbound and outbound shipments. Raw materials costs still are at record highs, and we have raised customer pricing, with additional increases in the near future due to labor costs going up. Huge customer orders are nine months out (due to) backorders. Seeing this domestically and internationally.”<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Supplier Deliveries (</strong><strong><em>ISM Manufacturing Index</em></strong><strong>)</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> It&#39;s at <strong>73.4</strong>, up <strong>3.9pp</strong> from last month. </li>\n<li>That&#39;s not good because anything <strong>above 50</strong> means it&#39;s difficult for suppliers to meet customer demands and a m/m increase means deliveries slowed even further compared to the previous month </li>\n<li> The index continues to reflect suppliers’ difficulties in meeting demand due to:\n\n<ul>\n<li>ongoing supplier hiring challenges</li>\n<li>extended raw materials lead times at all tiers</li>\n<li>increasing levels of input material shortages</li>\n<li>stubbornly high prices</li>\n<li>inconsistent transportation availability,” </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>Customer&#39; Inventories (</strong><strong><em>ISM Manufacturing Index</em></strong><strong>)</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> It&#39;s at <strong>31.7</strong>, up <strong>1.5pp</strong> from last month. </li>\n<li>There was a m/m improvement, but the bottom-line is that&#39;s not good because anything <strong>below 50</strong> means inventories for customers are too low. </li>\n<li> This is the 14th consecutive month where the index has been at historically low levels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Backlog of Orders (</strong><strong><em>ISM Manufacturing Index</em></strong><strong>)</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> It&#39;s at <strong>64.8</strong>, down <strong>3.4pp</strong> from last month. </li>\n<li>Still not a good situation because anything <strong>above 50</strong> means a backlog, which reflects production for manufacturers not keeping up with orders from customers hence why they&#39;re in the backlog.</li>\n<li>But, there was a m/m improvement meaning backlogs expanded at a lower rate in September vs August &amp; production was able to keep up with continuing strong new order levels </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.</strong>   <strong># of container ships at anchor in Los Angles &amp; Long Beach</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>About <strong>80 - 90</strong> ships were on anchor on a given day since mid Sep</li>\n<li>That&#39;s at an all-time high and more ships at anchor = fewer ships unable to offload inventory = difficult for trade to flow</li>\n<li>Cool article illustrating the upcoming consequences of ships at anchor right now:  <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cargo-ships-new-york-california-four-week-supply-chain-crisis-2021-10\">Cargo Ships in LA, NY Face 4-Week Wait to Dock Amid Supply Chain Chaos (businessinsider.com)</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Freightos Baltic Index (FBX): Global Container Freight Index</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Was <strong>$10.5K - $11.0K</strong> during Sep &#39;21, up from ~$10.0K levels during Aug &#39;21</li>\n<li>Fewer ships available validated by # of container ships at anchor in California (<em>mentioned above</em>) means price of shipping of shipping is going up. Higher shipping costs makes it difficult for manufacturers to make goods and customers get the inventory they need to meet demand. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Backlogs and customer inventories improved for some, but it&#39;s still a negative situation. Port congestion has gotten worse and in response shipping costs has gone higher as well. Managers are still saying the same stuff: port issues, materials shortages, lack of labor, and high costs are making the job harder and making it difficult to meet high customer demands heading into the holidays.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzzg1v/what_im_seeing_with_supply_chain_disruptions_sep/","title":"What I'm seeing with supply chain disruptions: Sep '21 edition","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-02T21:39:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-02 21:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pzzg1v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzzg1v/what_im_seeing_with_supply_chain_disruptions_sep/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzzg1v/what_im_seeing_with_supply_chain_disruptions_sep/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ricke813","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ricke813","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ricke813","score":112,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"サプライチェーンの混乱を目の当たりにして思うこと。21年9月版","the_new_excerpt":"私がどのようにサプライチェーンの混乱を監視しているかについては、以前の記事を参照してください。どのように\nサプライチェーンの混乱を監視する : 株式 (reddit.com)\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/prfsi4/how_to_monitor_the_supply_chain_disruptions/]\n\n\n\n1. 回答者の声(ISM製造業景況指数)\n\n *...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我所看到的供应链中断的情况。21年9月版","the_new_excerpt":"请参阅我之前的文章，了解我如何监测供应链中断的入门知识。如何\n监测供应链中断的情况：股票（reddit.com\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/prfsi4/how_to_monitor_the_supply_chain_disruptions/]\n\n\n\n1. 受访者在说什么（ISM制造业指数\n\n *...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我所看到的供應鏈中斷的情況。21年9月版","the_new_excerpt":"請參閱我之前的文章，瞭解我如何監測供應鏈中斷的入門知識。如何\n監測供應鏈中斷的情況：股票（reddit.com\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/prfsi4/how_to_monitor_the_supply_chain_disruptions/]\n\n\n\n1. 受訪者在說什麼（ISM製造業指數\n\n *...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pzy0fv","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pzy0fv/avantis_investors_announces_launch_of_four_new/","title":"Avantis Investors Announces Launch of Four New ETFs Focused on Real Estate and Value","date":"October 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アバンティス・インベスターズ、不動産とバリューに特化した4つの新しいETFの発売を発表","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Avantis Investors宣布推出四只专注于房地产和价值的新ETFs","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Avantis Investors宣佈推出四隻專注於房地產和價值的新ETFs","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q00eh1","excerpt":"I’m looking into p2p lending in the United States, and every service I look into\nis only offering investment services to institutional investors.
