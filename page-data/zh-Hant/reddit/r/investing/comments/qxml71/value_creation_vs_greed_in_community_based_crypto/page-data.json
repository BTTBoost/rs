Even if you can&#39;t see it, there&#39;s always a house, and the house...we know what the house does, and it ain&#39;t losing.</p>\n\n<p>I feel that&#39;s where the market&#39;s at with the big players. Even the most boomer or normie-tier investors have, at the very least, HEARD of these. It&#39;s been made extremely available, too. It&#39;s almost easier to buy it than not.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s what people are doing. They&#39;re hearing the buzz and forking over the dough. But why? Is it the low price? Is it the success stories? Is it the easy access? Is it the presence in the cultural zeitgeist?</p>\n\n<p>Probably all of these, really. But in all of these things, one critical element is missing:</p>\n\n<p>Honest, real discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Just try to have any real discussion about these types of coins with anyone who holds, or is purported to hold, a big-ass bag. Or a small bag. Whatever.</p>\n\n<p>You start talking about market cap, inflation, burn - honestly, any real concern that any reasonable buyer or holder may have, and watch how far you get. Watch how quickly your reasonable questions or concerns get swallowed up by the fervor of the irritated hivemind.</p>\n\n<p>Ever wonder what it feels like to be one of those huge hornets that gets vibrated to death by a bunch of bees? Just do the above. Closest human approximation there is.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no actual reason for the few of these tokens to have succeeded beyond pure novelty and greed, but that won&#39;t be enough for long. They&#39;re simply vehicles by which the illusion of potential riches are delivered to the hungry, wanting masses.</p>\n\n<p>Truly disheartening to see how many people there are who are so eager to march to the beat of any drum, even if that march is gonna take them right off a cliff.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve spent some time lurking many, many crypt-communities. All are largely what I&#39;ve described above: willing masses easily duped into closing their minds and opening their wallets, and their attitude reflects it. There&#39;s no real sense of community or belonging. It&#39;s simply &quot;I put my money here, and now I must defend my money.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That shit don&#39;t work. Money&#39;s no sufficient coagulating agent for the commingled blood of men. Pursuit of money and wealth alone are, by nature, selfish and isolating. Any community built around those as a central principle are doomed either to fail honestly or - worse - succeed dishonestly.</p>\n\n<p>For now, no one really gives a shit about these tokens. Nobody in those communities, or any others like them, gives a shit about each other on an individual level either. You&#39;re a drone. You&#39;re a Wallet. You&#39;re not Steve or Jane or William or Kate.</p>\n\n<p>To them, you&#39;re a Nobody. You&#39;re only as good as your ability to buy or sell, because there is no other element to their culture.</p>\n\n<p>All that said:</p>\n\n<p>If you think they will all always be like this, I think you&#39;ve got the wrong of it. The next generation will be those that have a culture and community in in which the making of money is NOT the central element.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s mostly about content</p>\n\n<p>Truly. If a true community can be created, one where creating content on its behalf is the fun of it, it can be an extremely powerful flywheel. When the basis of the coin is community and fun, a self-reinforcing and bootstrapping process can occur.</p>\n\n<p>The money comes because of content, the creativity, and the enjoyment everyone gets from it. This is what attracts and retains new holders. It isn&#39;t the other way around. If participating in the community is a fun thing to do, generating money just happens to be a convenient side effect.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qxml71/value_creation_vs_greed_in_community_based_crypto/","title":"Value creation vs. Greed in Community Based Crypto","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-19T19:33:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-19 19:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qxml71","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxml71/value_creation_vs_greed_in_community_based_crypto/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qxml71/value_creation_vs_greed_in_community_based_crypto/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"transtwin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/transtwin","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"transtwin","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"コミュニティ・ベース・クリプトにおける価値創造と貪欲さ","the_new_excerpt":"お金が絡むゲームでは、私はすでに不正が行われていると仮定して参加します。\nすでに不正が行われていることを前提にしています。目に見えなくても、必ず家があって、家......。\n家...家が何をするかはわかっていて、それは負けることではありません。\n\n大手のマーケットはそんな感じだと思います。団塊の世代でも\nまたは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"基于社区的加密货币中的价值创造与贪婪","the_new_excerpt":"在几乎所有与钱有关的游戏中，我都是带着这样的假设进入游戏的\n它已经被操纵了。即使你看不出来，总是有一个房子，而这个房子......我们知道这个房子是做什么的，它不会输。\n房子......我们知道房子会做什么，它不会输。\n\n我觉得这就是市场上的大玩家们的情况。即使是最潮的人\n或...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"基於社區的加密貨幣中的價值創造與貪婪","the_new_excerpt":"在幾乎所有與錢有關的遊戲中，我都是帶着這樣的假設進入遊戲的\n它已經被操縱了。即使你看不出來，總是有一個房子，而這個房子......我們知道這個房子是做什麼的，它不會輸。\n房子......我們知道房子會做什麼，它不會輸。\n\n我覺得這就是市場上的大玩家們的情況。即使是最潮的人\n或...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qxjgcu","excerpt":"My Paypal cost basis is around $235, paypal and venmo are very widely used by\nmany people.
