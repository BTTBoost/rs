In March they had expected to hold it steady through that year.\nPrompting the policy shift is a much stronger economic rebound and hotter inflation than the Fed anticipated just a few months ago.</p>\n\n<p>“Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of Covid-19 in the United States,” the Fed said in a statement following a two-day policy meeting. “Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.”</p>\n\n<p>In updated projections released Wednesday 13 of 18 officials indicated they expect to lift short-term rates by the end of 2023, up from seven who expected that outcome in March. In March, most of them anticipated holding rates steady through 2023.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed has held overnight interest rates steady since March 2020, when the effects of the pandemic caused the sharpest economic contraction in generations. The central bank also has been purchasing at least $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage bonds since June 2020 to hold down longer-term borrowing costs, providing further support to the recovery.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed reiterated that it expects to continue bond purchases until “substantial further progress” has been made in the recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Fed officials want the economy to get closer to their goals of “maximum employment” and sustained, 2% inflation before reducing the bond purchases. They have said they want to fully achieve those objectives before they raise interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>Since officials’ previous meeting, in April, the labor market’s progress has been somewhat slower than they had anticipated. Employers added 837,000 jobs in April and May, leaving total employment 7.6 million jobs shy of pre-pandemic levels.</p>\n\n<p>Policy makers have become less confident in recent weeks the economy can recover all the jobs lost amid the pandemic without spurring inflation. Some 2.6 million people retired between February 2020 and April, according to estimates from the Dallas Fed. A steadily aging U.S. population suggests limited scope for reversing that trend, some economists say.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, inflation has been higher than expected. The Labor Department’s consumer-price index rose 5% in May from a year earlier.</p>\n\n<p>That inflation rate, the highest since 2008, makes the Fed uncomfortable, even if officials believe it reflects mostly temporary factors that should fade later this year. They worry that if inflation exceeds 2% too much or for too long, it might lead businesses and consumers to anticipate more inflation in the future, which can become self-fulfilling. Evidence of rising inflation expectations would likely require the Fed to tighten policy sooner or more aggressively than planned to re-anchor those expectations around 2%.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o1bkt6/federal_reserve_now_expect_to_raise_rates_by_the/","title":"Federal Reserve now expect to raise rates by the end of 2023, rather than hold them near zero.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-16T19:23:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-16 19:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a323914a-c7fb-5ee5-b886-0055615a92c7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o1bkt6/federal_reserve_now_expect_to_raise_rates_by_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o1bkt6/federal_reserve_now_expect_to_raise_rates_by_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"breakingnews-bot","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/breakingnews-bot","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"breakingnews-bot","score":1573,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は現在、ゼロ付近での利上げではなく、2023年末までに利上げを行うと予想しています。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates-bond-purchases-june-2021-11623777582\n\nワシントン-米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は、2023年後半に利上げを行うとの見通しを示しました。\n景気が東日本大震災の影響から急速に回復していることから、3月に予想したよりも早く、2023年後半までに利上げを行う見通しを示しました。\nの影響から急速に回復していることから、2023年後半には3月の予想よりも早く利上げを行うとの見通しを示しました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美联储现在预计将在2023年底前加息，而不是将其保持在零附近。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates-bond-purchases-june-2021-11623777582\n\n华盛顿-美联储官员表示，他们预计将在20月底前提高利率。\n随着经济从金融危机的影响中迅速恢复，他们预计将在2023年底前提高利率，比他们3月份的预期要早。\n迅速恢复的影响。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美聯儲現在預計將在2023年底前加息，而不是將其保持在零附近。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates-bond-purchases-june-2021-11623777582\n\n華盛頓-美聯儲官員表示，他們預計將在20月底前提高利率。\n隨着經濟從金融危機的影響中迅速恢復，他們預計將在2023年底前提高利率，比他們3月份的預期要早。\n迅速恢復的影響。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-350be4b1-d843-55c9-b48a-2aa0711dc29b","excerpt":"AAPL is sitting at a first quarter annualised PE of 23.2.
