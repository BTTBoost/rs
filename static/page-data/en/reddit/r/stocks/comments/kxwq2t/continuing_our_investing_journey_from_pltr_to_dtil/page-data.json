I&#39;m back from this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jr4xl8/posted_about_nio_6_months_ago_and_got_3_upvotes/\">post</a> 2 months ago! I hope you all are still holding on to PLTR and NIO! I definitely still am. These two are definitely great companies and have much much more room to grow in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I told people following me about DTIL in this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kotsumu/comments/kv5sj1/interesting_tech_worth_keeping_an_eye_on_dtil/\">post</a> earlier this week and mentioned that I will post it for all sometime soon. I thought to post this on Monday next week, but I couldn&#39;t hold in the excitement anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s get down to business! CRISPR, if you do not have much background, is a method patented by University of California, Berkley to use an enzyme called Cas9 and a RNA strand to modify the genetic information of organisms. I&#39;m not going to go into detail about how it all works and <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> doesn&#39;t allow video links, so go to my earlier post this week to see the links to some juicy CRISPR information.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been following CRISPR technology for a couple years. However, the timing never felt quite right. Early last year, I was actually looking at EDIT (Editas) but after sorting through some of my thoughts and their documents, I decided not to invest. I really wanted to get into CRISPR but I always had a bias against pharmaceutical companies because of its volatile nature and dependency on drug clearances. There are other reasons but in the end, I decided not to invest and missed out on some big gains It&#39;s fine though, I make it a point to look back at opportunities missed once to learn from it and never look back again. There are way too many opportunities out there to waste time regretting. Since I didn&#39;t have a good target back then, I just threw some allocated funds into ARKG and called it a day.</p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering why I&#39;m talking about CRISPR when Precision Bioscience doesn&#39;t do anything related to CRISPR. It might be evident to you that the CRISPR space is bubbly right now. With CRSP and EDIT at all time highs, it might not be wise to jump in. Luckily for us, Precision Biosciences has their own proprietary platform, free of patents and licenses, that allows gene editing called ARCUS. There are not much information out there publicly due to the proprietary nature of the tech, but the idea seems similar. It uses a different enzyme called I-Crel to splice genes and because of its properties, it allows more precise cuts to the DNA strands that results into a less error prone process than CRISPR. The end result is the same, we are still investing in the future of gene editing, we also break free from the licensing restrictions that lock CRSP technology in pharmaceuticals. Yes, that&#39;s right, CRISPR doesn&#39;t need to only be used in therapeutics, think about what it can do for agriculture and the environment.</p>\n\n<p>In summary here are the precise reasons why I&#39;m starting a small position in Precision Biosciences (pun intended)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CRISPR is a great new tech but most companies are in the pharmaceutical space</li>\n<li>CRISPR patent woes may slow down innovation</li>\n<li>ARCUS is proprietary and free of licensing constraints to explore the applications of gene editing and its benefits</li>\n<li>I have no way of validating it, but ARCUS is marketed as a less error prone CRISPR. Resulting in more precise genetic modifications.</li>\n<li>With all that said, I believe heavily that gene editing has huge applications in the future not limited to medicine, but in agriculture and the environment as well. Think higher yield, less maintained crops, livestock. Plants/bacteria/organisms that are engineered to solve some environment issues like plastic waste, CO2, or climate change.</li>\n<li>Precision Biosciences does dabble in both medical applications and food via its subsidiary, Elo Life Systems</li>\n<li>CRISPR companies are relatively richly valued (CRSP at 14.5B market cap, EDIT at 5B) whereas DTIL is only valued at 550M indicating that there is a lot of room to grow</li>\n<li>The size of their contracts are smaller, but they do have some recent strategic partnerships with high profile companies like Eli Lilly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With all that said, DTIL seems to be higher risk than some of the other companies that I&#39;ve posted about previously. They have some cash on hand, albeit not much. It is still enough to give them runway till 2022 where I envision they will need to raise cash again. I plan to be a little bit more conservative with DTIL due to the nature of bio tech companies being volatile. I&#39;ll increase my position as I see fit.</p>\n\n<p>As always, please do your own DD!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kxwq2t/continuing_our_investing_journey_from_pltr_to_dtil/","title":"Continuing our investing journey from PLTR to DTIL","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-15T17:02:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-15 17:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"fcec64be-76db-5d52-8cdf-87ad2cdcdb71","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxwq2t/continuing_our_investing_journey_from_pltr_to_dtil/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxwq2t/continuing_our_investing_journey_from_pltr_to_dtil/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"kotsumu","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kotsumu","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"kotsumu","score":678,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"继续我们的投资之旅，从PLTR到D[今天我学到了]。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好！我从这个岗位回来了\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jr4xl8/posted_about_nio_6_months_ago_and_got_3_upvotes/]\n2个月前! 希望大家还在坚持PLTR和NIO! 我绝对\n现在仍然是。这两家公司绝对是伟大的公司，而且还有很大的空间\n增长...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"繼續我們的投資之旅，從PLTR到D[今天我學到了]。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好！我從這個崗位回來了\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jr4xl8/posted_about_nio_6_months_ago_and_got_3_upvotes/]\n2個月前! 希望大家還在堅持PLTR和NIO! 我絕對\n現在仍然是。這兩家公司絕對是偉大的公司，而且還有很大的空間\n增長...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3e2bd629-1311-505b-90bd-baeee84c103b","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxw4hu/dont_relent_now_boys_i_just_bought_1000_on_margin/","title":"Don't relent now boys.
