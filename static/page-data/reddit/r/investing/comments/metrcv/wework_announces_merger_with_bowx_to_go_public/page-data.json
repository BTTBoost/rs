EBITDA of 1.98 Billion in 2024 but they are assuming 85% occupancy to get that figure, so I don&#39;t know how realistic that figure is. Wework is a much better company that last time it tried to go public and the new management has cut costs with a chainsaw. I still think it is a bad business.  The pro-forma shares outstanding is 792.7 Million and at current prices, the company is valued at 8.8 Billion.   </p>\n\n<p>Projecting a loss of 922M in terms of adj. EBITDA next year and then expects to generates adj.EBITDA profit of 428M in 2022. that means it won&#39;t turn a profit for a long time, They have about 4 Billion dollars. The interest on those debt will probably wipe away most of the EBITDA. Also share compensation seems low and we can probably expect an increase after the IPO.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/metrcv/wework_announces_merger_with_bowx_to_go_public/","title":"Wework announces merger with BowX to go public","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-29T01:43:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-29 01:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"da7b3bc3-1efe-57b9-b15e-7600973f6afc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/metrcv/wework_announces_merger_with_bowx_to_go_public/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/metrcv/wework_announces_merger_with_bowx_to_go_public/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Outside-South5454","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Outside-South5454","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Outside-South5454","score":45,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Wework宣布与BowX合并后上市","the_new_excerpt":"介绍\n[https://www.wework.com/ideas/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/WeWork-Management-Presentation-March-2021-vF-1.pdf]\n\n他们预计2024年的EBITDA为19.8亿，但他们假设的是\n85%的入住率才能得到这个数字，所以我不知道这个数字有多现实。\n我们的工作是一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Wework宣佈與BowX合併後上市","the_new_excerpt":"介紹\n[https://www.wework.com/ideas/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/WeWork-Management-Presentation-March-2021-vF-1.pdf]\n\n他們預計2024年的EBITDA爲19.8億，但他們假設的是\n85%的入住率才能得到這個數字，所以我不知道這個數字有多現實。\n我們的工作是一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5046a2cc-b719-5a5d-a130-a106efab138a","excerpt":"A huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3\nbillion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20\nmillion real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles).
