Getting the SEC involved right now has a significant risk of them coming in and shutting down trading completely, if they decided to tally the books. Best case, this will benefit the hedge funds, market makers and DTCC by giving them breathing room to come up with damage-limiting strategies to cover their corruption. Worst case, they might decide forced liquidations of the counterfeit shares at a &quot;reasonable price is the best course of action, to prevent contagion and ensure stability&quot; yadda yadda yadda. I can hear the soundbites already.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC has known full-well for years what&#39;s been going on and never moved. Ask yourself whose side they&#39;re really on.</p>\n\n<p>Write to the SEC after the squeeze or the minute there is more manipulation - if that happens again, make their ears bleed. But not before.</p>\n\n<p>My 2 cents of non-financial advice.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Some people really want to take action. In that case writing your rep/senators might be a good idea - they are the ones who can change laws and that&#39;s what&#39;s needed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mclt3u/do_not_pressure_the_sec_to_take_action_a/","title":"Do NOT pressure the SEC to take action - a political excuse for trading to be halted is the LAST thing we need right now","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-25T08:18:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-25 08:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"18d48a91-9a12-576c-8445-5369b210b723","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mclt3u/do_not_pressure_the_sec_to_take_action_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mclt3u/do_not_pressure_the_sec_to_take_action_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Iconoclastices","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Iconoclastices","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Iconoclastices","score":5402,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不要向美国证券交易委员会施压，要求其采取行动--我们现在最不需要的就是用政治借口来停止交易。","the_new_excerpt":"我看到今天呼吁证监会介入的帖子数量有所上升，关于\n在这里和其他的子社区，大多数人都在呼吁进行份额统计或类似的采取。\n的地方。\n\n我不相信这是一个聪明的举动，在所有。让证监会参与现在\n有很大的风险，他们进来，并关闭... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要向美國證券交易委員會施壓，要求其採取行動--我們現在最不需要的就是用政治藉口來停止交易。","the_new_excerpt":"我看到今天呼籲證監會介入的帖子數量有所上升，關於\n在這裏和其他的子社區，大多數人都在呼籲進行份額統計或類似的採取。\n的地方。\n\n我不相信這是一個聰明的舉動，在所有。讓證監會參與現在\n有很大的風險，他們進來，並關閉... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ca9d3181-0124-570e-87dd-193e2d23bcc9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcmymy/me_buying_gme_at_the_dip/","title":"Me buying GME at the dip 🦍🚀💎","date":"March 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我买GME的时候 🦍🚀💎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我買GME的時候 🦍🚀💎","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-00a2b903-e46a-5ae7-b9e1-6d9d165fc8c9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckj9i/footage_from_the_future/","title":"Footage from the future","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 25, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"来自未来的镜头","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"來自未來的鏡頭","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-18d48a91-9a12-576c-8445-5369b210b723","previousId":"RedditPost-ca9d3181-0124-570e-87dd-193e2d23bcc9","nextId":"RedditPost-00a2b903-e46a-5ae7-b9e1-6d9d165fc8c9","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mclt3u/do_not_pressure_the_sec_to_take_action_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
