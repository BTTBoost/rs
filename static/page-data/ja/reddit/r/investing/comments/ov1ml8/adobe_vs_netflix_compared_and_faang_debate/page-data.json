I believe they have better growth potential thanks to better pricing power and more user growth potential. (us&amp;international growth vs netflix primarily international) higher margins (40% vs 16%), stock buybacks (-1% vs +1% dilution), high switching costs better moat, much better balance sheet for adobe.</p>\n\n<p>On a forward pe, adobe is about 10% more expensive (fwd pe of 44 vs 40) and marketcap wise it is about 25% higher. (adobe makes about 15% more profit) The main benefit for netflix is improving margins over time but I only see net profit margins going to 25% max.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I want to add for adobe has over 100 products with 60% being creative cloud and that alone has 20-30 famous products like photoshop, primer pro, the stuff you know adobe for. document cloud and digital experience no one knows but that segment is growing like crazy whereas netflix makes 99% of revenue from one main product. the two segments for adobe is mostly business to business like digital marketing, digital signatures, data analytics, ai, ecommerce sales, publishing, and much more and makes 40% of sales and growing in a fast market where things are going more digital (think youtube, shopify, docusign). I just dont see much growth for netflix where pretty much in the us more than 70 million users out of 120 million households have it already.</p>\n\n<p>But i put up an poll on whats better and everyone said netflix, but no one really explained why? is adobe underrated and should it replace netflix in faang, or is netflix still king and explain why it is better because i dont get the hype and why everyone still use faang for big tech synonym when they are several other growth tech companies like adobe that have much higher marketcap than netflix. anyways, what is your pick on whats the better company</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ov1ml8/adobe_vs_netflix_compared_and_faang_debate/","title":"Adobe vs Netflix compared (and faang debate)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-31T07:34:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-31 07:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"22af85e1-ba0d-5401-a237-bf9f52ac2c5d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ov1ml8/adobe_vs_netflix_compared_and_faang_debate/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ov1ml8/adobe_vs_netflix_compared_and_faang_debate/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"doggy_lovers","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/doggy_lovers","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"doggy_lovers","score":337,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アドビとNetflixの比較（とファングの議論","the_new_excerpt":"これらを比較するために選んだのは、どちらもサブスクリプションベースのモデルを運営しており\n市場規模（約2,500億円）、企業規模（約54社）が似ているからです。 今のところ\n私はアドビに傾いています。その理由は、アドビには競合他社が少ないからです。\n理由は、競合他社が少なく、製品の種類も豊富だからです。また、成長の可能性も高いと考えています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Adobe与Netflix的比较（和faang辩论","the_new_excerpt":"我选择这两家公司进行比较，因为它们都是基于订阅的模式，并且\n都有类似的市值（2500亿左右），以及pe（54左右）。\n我倾向于Adobe，原因是他们的竞争对手很少。\n多样的产品系列。我相信他们有更好的增长潜力...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Adobe與Netflix的比較（和faang辯論","the_new_excerpt":"我選擇這兩家公司進行比較，因爲它們都是基於訂閱的模式，並且\n都有類似的市值（2500億左右），以及pe（54左右）。\n我傾向於Adobe，原因是他們的競爭對手很少。\n多樣的產品系列。我相信他們有更好的增長潛力...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6f0821f5-420f-5ddf-9462-22d21a8a9ada","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ouypzd/my_robinhood_charger_has_been_acting_weird_since/","title":"My Robinhood Charger Has Been Acting Weird Since the IPO","date":"July 31, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"IPO以降、Robinhoodの充電器が変な動きをしています。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的Robinhood充电器自IPO以来一直表现得很奇怪","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的Robinhood充電器自IPO以來一直表現得很奇怪","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6bd1e214-5106-5dbb-b91f-726bba8f7075","excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-faces-more-than-slowing-sales-growth-it-needs-more-warehouses-2021-07-30/\n\nAmazon plans to add 517 facilities to its global distribution infrastructure in\nthe coming years, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International.
