According to the Des Moines Register, pro-strike sentiment has been strong on the ground in Iowa, where union members have erected signs reading “REJECT THIS PIECE OF TRASH” and “YOU DESERVE BETTER.” According to a dispatch from Labor Notes, several union members also showed up to local meetings sporting “F*** No” t-shirts, and at least one member took up the microphone to say that the only thing the agreement was good for was “wiping my ass.”</p>\n\n<p>Now, unless an agreement is reached by the new strike deadline imposed by the UAW of 11:59pm on Wednesday, October 13, more than 10,000 Deere workers at nine locals in Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas are set to walk off the job in what would amount to the largest private-sector strike since the 40-day walkout staged by UAW workers employed by GM in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Officials at John Deere have, thus far, signaled a willingness to keep negotiations going, telling the Register in a statement that the company “remains fully committed to continuing the collective bargaining process in an effort to better understand our employees’ viewpoints,” and saying that operations “will continue as normal” in the meantime. But according to internal company emails reviewed by Labor Notes, the company also seems to be increasingly looking to hire white-collar workers in an active effort to “cast a broader net to fill critical factory positions in the case of a work stoppage.”</p>\n\n<p>In addition to setting itself up for one of the biggest labor showdowns in recent memory during a year that has already been rife with worker unrest, labor shortages, and strike efforts, John Deere has also recently emerged as a critical battleground for national right-to-repair laws. Because of its refusal to allow farmworkers to repair their own equipment, the company is frequently seen as being at the heart of the struggle against manufacturing repair monopolies and was referenced as such by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders during his doomed campaign for the presidency in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>“In rural America today, farmers can’t even repair their own tractors or other equipment because of the greed of companies like John Deere,” Sanders wrote at the time, vowing that if he became president, he would “pass a national right-to-repair law that gives every farmer in America full rights over the machinery they buy.”</p>\n\n<p>Under the administration of President Joe Biden, right-to-repair has seen several modest victories recently, including a sweeping executive order that directed the Federal Trade Commission to draft regulations that limit the ability of companies like Deere to restrict independent repairs of their products.</p>\n\n<p>https://gi zmodo.com/john-deere-workers-sure-look-like-they-re-about-to-go-o-1847847258</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q6z2o9/john_deere_workers_sure_look_like_theyre_about_to/","title":"John Deere Workers Sure Look Like They’re About to Go on Strike","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-13T02:43:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-13 02:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q6z2o9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q6z2o9/john_deere_workers_sure_look_like_theyre_about_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q6z2o9/john_deere_workers_sure_look_like_theyre_about_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rockinoutwith2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rockinoutwith2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rockinoutwith2","score":699,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"John Deere社の労働者は、今にもストライキを起こしそうな勢いである。","the_new_excerpt":"ジョンディア社の労働者は、ストライキに向けて急ピッチで動いている。\n労働組合が勧告した6年間の新しい労働協約を圧倒的な投票で拒否したことで\nジョンディアの労働者は、労働者を代表する組合である全米自動車労組（UAW）が提案した\nUAW（全米自動車労組）が推奨していた6年間の新協約を、圧倒的な強さで拒否したのです。\n\n日曜日、UAWの投票権を持つ組合員の90％が、この6年間の労働協約を否決しました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"约翰迪尔公司的工人看起来好像要罢工了","the_new_excerpt":"约翰迪尔公司的工人们在以压倒性优势投票表决后，正一步步地接近罢工。\n他们以压倒性的票数拒绝了一份新的六年期集体谈判协议。\n该协议是由代表他们的工会--美国汽车工人联合会（UAW）推荐的。\n工人联合会（UAW）。\n\n周日，90%的UAW投票成员否决了该协议。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"約翰迪爾公司的工人看起來好像要罷工了","the_new_excerpt":"約翰迪爾公司的工人們在以壓倒性優勢投票表決後，正一步步地接近罷工。\n他們以壓倒性的票數拒絕了一份新的六年期集體談判協議。\n該協議是由代表他們的工會--美國汽車工人聯合會（UAW）推薦的。\n工人聯合會（UAW）。\n\n週日，90%的UAW投票成員否決了該協議。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1448090289734918148","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1448090289734918148","title":"Seattle: 292 police officers have not yet provided proof of vaccination, while another 111 officers are waiting on potential medical or religious exemptions\n\nThat is 40% of the police force","date":"October 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"シアトル：292人の警察官がワクチン接種の証明書を提出しておらず、さらに111人の警察官が医療上または宗教上の免除の可能性を待っている。\n\nこれは警察官の40％にあたる","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"西雅图：292名警察尚未提供疫苗接种证明，另有111名警察正在等待潜在的医疗或宗教豁免\n\n这相当于40%的警察部队","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"西雅圖：292名警察尚未提供疫苗接種證明，另有111名警察正在等待潛在的醫療或宗教豁免\n\n這相當於40%的警察部隊","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q6yjjl","excerpt":"Now a lot of what will be said here is not what you are used to seeing in the\nmarket news but bear with me.
