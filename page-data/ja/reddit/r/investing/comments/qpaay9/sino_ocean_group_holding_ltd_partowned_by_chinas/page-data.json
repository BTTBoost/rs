Its 4.75%  note due 2030 fell Monday to as low as 73.48 cents on the dollar, with  spreads over comparable Treasuries widening to a record 800 basis  points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  </p>\n\n<p>That’s  despite the firm being rated investment-grade at two global credit  assessors and holding about 54 times more cash and equivalents than  China Evergrande Group. Sino Ocean’s shares have been doing better,  rebounding 35% from their September low. They rose 3.5% Monday.  </p>\n\n<p>Stress  in the market for Chinese property bonds is reaching extreme levels as  surging borrowing costs make refinancing dollar debt too expensive and a  slowing housing market shrinks revenue.  </p>\n\n<p>China’s  finance ministry controls just under 30% of Sino Ocean’s shares,  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. State-owned Dajia Insurance  Group -- the company that took over most of the operations of troubled  Anbang Insurance Group Co. -- holds a similar-sized stake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qpaay9/sino_ocean_group_holding_ltd_partowned_by_chinas/","title":"Sino Ocean Group Holding Ltd., part-owned by China's finance ministry, has become the latest property company to see its bonds slump.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-08T14:23:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-08 14:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qpaay9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qpaay9/sino_ocean_group_holding_ltd_partowned_by_chinas/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qpaay9/sino_ocean_group_holding_ltd_partowned_by_chinas/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Spirited-Pause","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spirited-Pause","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Spirited-Pause","score":223,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"中国の財務省が一部出資しているシノ・オーシャン・グループ・ホールディング・リミテッドは、債券が低迷している最新の不動産会社となった。","the_new_excerpt":"https://archive.md/20211108075537/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/chinese-developer-controlled-by-government-is-latest-to-plunge#selection-3459.0-3463.271\n\n\n\n> 中国の開発者向け債券の暴落が深刻化しているが、国有企業でさえ安全ではない。\n> 中国の開発者向け社債の暴落から国有企業も安全ではない。\n> \n> Sino Ocean Group Holding...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"由中国财政部部分拥有的中洋集团控股有限公司，已经成为最新一家看到其债券下滑的房地产公司。","the_new_excerpt":"https://archive.md/20211108075537/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/chinese-developer-controlled-by-government-is-latest-to-plunge#selection-3459.0-3463.271\n\n\n\n> 即使是国有企业也无法在中国日益加深的溃败中幸免。\n> 开发商债券。\n> \n> 中海集团控股有限公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"由中國財政部部分擁有的中洋集團控股有限公司，已經成爲最新一家看到其債券下滑的房地產公司。","the_new_excerpt":"https://archive.md/20211108075537/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/chinese-developer-controlled-by-government-is-latest-to-plunge#selection-3459.0-3463.271\n\n\n\n> 即使是國有企業也無法在中國日益加深的潰敗中倖免。\n> 開發商債券。\n> \n> 中海集團控股有限公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qp5hz2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qp5hz2/its_gonna_be_awesome/","title":"It’s gonna be awesome","date":"November 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"凄いことになっている","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"这将是非常棒的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"這將是非常棒的","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qpd7we","excerpt":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59201945\n\nRolls Royce have been developing SMRs, targeting the change to a net-zero\neconomy.
