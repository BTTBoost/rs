A jobs report comes out with highest unemployment in 4 years. FANG stocks 11% loss in a day. Total market -6% in a day. A few funds and banks announce they are closing. You have smart friends in the investment space telling you they are going to pull out.</p>\n\n<p>The market has started to crash but just begun. You feel as if you are still somewhat ahead of the curve. Youve realized a 8-12% loss over  2 months and the news is laying it on that its about to get worse..</p>\n\n<p>Do you HOLD tight? Sell a portion... Sell all? Rebalance portfolio depending on market conditions? </p>\n\n<p>I see a lot of posts on how to get to the top but im curious for those that have reached FIRE how have you played out the scenario of when it could tumble and is there an emergency exit or a threshold for action you have planned out?</p>\n\n<p>(I would have imagined that the 2020 crash was this exact scenario for many.....although 2020 crash was almost immediate compared to 2007. Id compare more to a period like Sept 2007 to March 2008, this was a clear trend reversal that lasted several months before a complete drop that lasted until the end of 2008. What do you do if you get to play out a Dec 2007-Jan 2008 scenario...market crashing but just the start of the drop.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p5flr8/market_crash_scenario_for_fire/","title":"Market Crash Scenario for FIRE","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-16T17:37:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-16 17:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6ae33ae5-f82e-526b-8c5b-b9c1e0f4a0dd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p5flr8/market_crash_scenario_for_fire/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p5flr8/market_crash_scenario_for_fire/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"ethan_hunt9000","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ethan_hunt9000","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ethan_hunt9000","score":36,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FIREの市場崩壊シナリオ","the_new_excerpt":"FIREを達成した人は、このシナリオを考えたことがあると思います。\nあなたの考えを聞かせてください。....\n\n500～1,000万ドルを米国株式市場全体のインデックスファンドに預けています。\nファンドを持っています。\n\nその先に問題があることを知っています。雇用統計で過去4年間で最高の失業率が発表されました。\n失業率が過去4年間で最高になりました。FANG...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"金融业的市场崩溃情况","the_new_excerpt":"对于那些已经达到退休年龄的人来说......我想你们已经想到了这种情况。\n我很好奇你的想法....\n\n你有500万到1000万美元的资金，放在你选择的美国股票市场总指数基金中。\n基金。\n\n你看到前面有麻烦。一份就业报告显示，失业率为4年来最高。\n4年来的最高失业率。FANG...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"金融業的市場崩潰情況","the_new_excerpt":"對於那些已經達到退休年齡的人來說......我想你們已經想到了這種情況。\n我很好奇你的想法....\n\n你有500萬到1000萬美元的資金，放在你選擇的美國股票市場總指數基金中。\n基金。\n\n你看到前面有麻煩。一份就業報告顯示，失業率爲4年來最高。\n4年來的最高失業率。FANG...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1427308872625180678","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1427308872625180678","title":"RT @JackPosobiec: Transgender USAF veteran trapped in Taliban takeover of Kabul https://t.co/HXYtCjC8Kc","date":"August 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @JackPosobiec: トランスジェンダーの米空軍退役軍人がタリバンによるカブールの占拠で捕まった https://t.co/HXYtCjC8Kc","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"トランスジェンダーの米空軍退役軍人がタリバンに占領されたカブールで捕まった https://t.co/HXYtCjC8Kc"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @JackPosobiec: 变性的美国空军老兵被困在塔利班接管的喀布尔 https://t.co/HXYtCjC8Kc","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"变性的美国空军老兵被困在塔利班接管的喀布尔https://t.co/HXYtCjC8Kc"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @JackPosobiec: 變性的美國空軍老兵被困在塔利班接管的喀布爾 https://t.co/HXYtCjC8Kc","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"變性的美國空軍老兵被困在塔利班接管的喀布爾https://t.co/HXYtCjC8Kc"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-9032a955-649f-56c2-bbbc-f4aca86b6b36","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5j4q1/apes_trying_to_follow_investing_strategy/","title":"Apes trying to follow investing strategy","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 16, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投資戦略に従おうとする類人猿","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"试图遵循投资策略的猿猴","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"試圖遵循投資策略的猿猴","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-6ae33ae5-f82e-526b-8c5b-b9c1e0f4a0dd","previousId":"TweetPost-1427308872625180678","nextId":"RedditPost-9032a955-649f-56c2-bbbc-f4aca86b6b36","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p5flr8/market_crash_scenario_for_fire/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
