Maybe you give more weight to ideas you have greater confidence in, but in no case should a single position take up more than 10% of your capital unless you&#39;re Warren Buffett.</p>\n\n<p>One very nasty fact of investing is that <strong>compounding works in reverse</strong> as well. If your portfolio suffers a 25% loss, you need a 33% gain to recover; a 50% loss requires a 100% gain. </p>\n\n<p>Realistically most people are financially and emotionally crushed by anything in excess of a 30% portfolio loss. It can take years to recover from blowing up like that, because the engine of compounding has to be restarted all over again.</p>\n\n<p>If you have appropriate position sizing and do some simple risk management (don&#39;t diamond hand it into the dirt...) one bad position cannot blow up your portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Even the best investor <strong>is not right every single time</strong>. Peter Lynch said he&#39;d be thrilled to be right just 60% of the time. </p>\n\n<p>If you do bad position sizing, and YOLO the majority of your capital into each position, <strong>even if you could be right 90% of the time</strong> you will eventually hit that 1-in-10 chance and all your gains are gone. </p>\n\n<p>Over in <a href=\"/r/GMEbagholdersclub\">/r/GMEbagholdersclub</a> there are many people who successfully traded up into a 6 figure account, felt like they were on top of the world, and got sent back to square one.</p>\n\n<p>The other reason to have many positions is it <strong>gives you choices</strong> - the worst part of bagholding a losing position is all your capital is tied up, and it&#39;s psychologically difficult to take a big loss and reinvest elsewhere, even if you know you should -- it&#39;s better to be able to focus on other positives rather than watching one position drag your entire portfolio down like an anchor.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>By the way, this rule does not make exceptions for blue chips or &quot;oh it&#39;s Apple, who cares if it&#39;s 40% of my portfolio, I&#39;ll never sell...&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I was motivated to make this post because one stock I own and had a ton of confidence in just missed earnings by $0.02 last week, and got hammered with a 12% price decline in a day. It&#39;s a boring dividend stock, and I&#39;d let it grow to over 10% of my portfolio because &quot;what could go wrong.&quot; It will come back eventually as the business is sound, but still a nasty shock for a very &quot;stable and safe&quot; stock.</p>\n\n<p>Markets are unpredictable and your best defense against that is to do risk management like a professional. Or just buy index funds.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ldsp04/a_quick_word_about_fundamentals_position_sizing/","title":"A Quick Word about fundamentals: Position Sizing","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T14:41:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 14:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8de50038-efdf-5f48-9a8a-c5c6d18bb6dd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldsp04/a_quick_word_about_fundamentals_position_sizing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldsp04/a_quick_word_about_fundamentals_position_sizing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"PrefersDigg","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PrefersDigg","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PrefersDigg","score":62,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"关于基本面的一个快字。仓位大小","the_new_excerpt":"一个做了一段时间的人给你的提示。\n\n这么多人被GME、其他各种追忆股击垮的一个关键原因是什么？\n在过去，未来必然会再次被击垮，归结为\n一个问题：仓位大小不合适。\n\n仓位大小不合适是什么意思？\n\n一个多元化的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於基本面的一個快字。倉位大小","the_new_excerpt":"一個做了一段時間的人給你的提示。\n\n這麼多人被GME、其他各種追憶股擊垮的一個關鍵原因是什麼？\n在過去，未來必然會再次被擊垮，歸結爲\n一個問題：倉位大小不合適。\n\n倉位大小不合適是什麼意思？\n\n一個多元化的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-362ccf7b-7870-5614-9c27-1019924028ce","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldrcl9/down_almost_68k_but_all_i_care_is_that_today_was/","title":"Down almost 68k, but all i care is that today was green, i’m a retard through and through.
