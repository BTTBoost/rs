In the past I have been a complete idiot with financial matters. Recently my dad passed away and left us a considerable sum. My wife is pretty adamant she wants an advisor and looking at my past financial mistakes I agree with her. </p>\n\n<p>So I went out and researched like crazy. We met with a friend&#39;s trusted 1% Aum guy, a Vanguard PAS guy and an advice-only guy. I liked the AUM guy and his advice but I think Bogleheads has turned me sour on AUM. Plus the AUM guy wanted everything at his brokerage.</p>\n\n<p>We initially liked the advice-only guy because he was cheaper and I thought he help me get my feet underneath me for DIY down the road. We could set everything up wherever we want. I also liked him because he set us up on their version of Mint to track all our spending. </p>\n\n<p>But he constantly hmmed and hawed on allocation. We had our 2nd meeting today and for an hour and a half he talked about getting a new credit card and retirement goals and tasks and ... I finally jumped in and said if you had to invest my dad&#39;s money what funds in the market tomorrow and what allocation would he recommend? He pulls up his website and hits an 70/30 Risk button - hits another button and boom pops out an 11 fund portfolio. I ask him what&#39;s the software they&#39;re using and he talks about low cost ratios. I asked him if they&#39;re licensing a robo-advisor of some kind and he kind of yada yada&#39;d that one.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0tddsua71n281.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b10ab2c9e458779ecc41a882376843dc097f360a\">https://preview.redd.it/0tddsua71n281.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b10ab2c9e458779ecc41a882376843dc097f360a</a></p>\n\n<p>I got kind of mad that it took him this long to throw out how he delivers allocation advice. I&#39;ve been looking at 3 and 4 fund Vanguard and Fidelity portfolios and told him that&#39;s what I wanted. Then my wife got mad. &quot;I&#39;m so tired of hearing about Boogle Heads,&quot; she says. She&#39;s like &quot;what&#39;s wrong with this?&quot; - and I just shut up. I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing I&#39;m just a guy that reads a forum who&#39;s messed up pretty bad in the past. Bogleheads is tough when you don&#39;t have a clue what you&#39;re doing but yet know you want something super simple but can&#39;t explain why that&#39;s better. I can&#39;t explain why VTI/VXUS/BND is better than this. Maybe it&#39;s not all that better? Maybe this is a perfectly fine portfolio?</p>\n\n<p>He also said he wants to DCA this and not lump sum. So my question is - say I go along with this in a Fidelity account. How hard would it be to convert this into a VTI/VXUS/BND down the road?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/r5bqrk/trouble_starting_off_with_an_advisor/","title":"Trouble Starting Off with an Advisor","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-30T05:20:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-30 05:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r5bqrk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/r5bqrk/trouble_starting_off_with_an_advisor/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/r5bqrk/trouble_starting_off_with_an_advisor/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"mobyhex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mobyhex","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mobyhex","score":21,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アドバイザーとのスタート時のトラブル","the_new_excerpt":"おそらくアドバイザーが最も嫌うことは、自分が何をしているのかわからないのに、そのために\n数ヶ月前からBogleheadsをフォローしています。これまでの私は、金融関係では全くのバカでした。\n私は過去に金融問題について全くの馬鹿でした。最近、私の父が亡くなり、かなりの額を私たちに残してくれました。\nかなりの額を残しました。私の妻は、アドバイザーが欲しいと強く言っています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"与顾问开始时的麻烦","the_new_excerpt":"可能是顾问们最讨厌的事情：我不知道自己在做什么，但已经关注Boglehead几个月了。\n已经关注Bogleheads几个月了。在过去，我一直是一个\n在财务问题上完全是个白痴。最近我父亲去世了，给我们留下了一笔\n相当多的钱。我的妻子非常坚定地认为她想要一个顾问和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"與顧問開始時的麻煩","the_new_excerpt":"可能是顧問們最討厭的事情：我不知道自己在做什麼，但已經關注Boglehead幾個月了。\n已經關注Bogleheads幾個月了。在過去，我一直是一個\n在財務問題上完全是個白癡。最近我父親去世了，給我們留下了一筆\n相當多的錢。我的妻子非常堅定地認爲她想要一個顧問和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r5ba4y","excerpt":"> When the clock stuck midnight on Nov. 29, tickets for “Spider-Man: No Way\n> Home” went on sale.
