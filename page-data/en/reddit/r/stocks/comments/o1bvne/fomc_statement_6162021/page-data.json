The Fed still thinks inflation is temporary and is going to let the economy run hot until unemployment comes down before it starts hiking rates. Still buying bonds $120b/mo at a time. See you next quarter. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210616a.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210616a.htm</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.</p>\n\n<p>Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain.</p>\n\n<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee&#39;s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee&#39;s maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee&#39;s goals. The Committee&#39;s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>\n\n<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Mary C. Daly; Charles L. Evans; Randal K. Quarles; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o1bvne/fomc_statement_6162021/","title":"FOMC statement 6/16/2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-16T20:30:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-16 20:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"133a60d9-ec35-57ad-ac1f-667bf93ff6b5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o1bvne/fomc_statement_6162021/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o1bvne/fomc_statement_6162021/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"desquibnt","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/desquibnt","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"desquibnt","score":116,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FOMC声明 6/16/2021","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：金融政策に変化なし。FRBは依然としてインフレは一時的なものと考えており\n失業率が下がるまで経済を活性化させてから、金融政策を開始するつもりだ。\n利上げを開始する前に失業率が下がるまで経済の過熱を放置するつもりだ。相変わらず月に1,200億ドルの債券購入を続けている。それではまた・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"FOMC声明 6/16/2021","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：货币政策没有变化。美联储仍然认为通货膨胀是暂时的\n并打算让经济热起来，直到失业率下降才开始加息。\n开始加息。仍在一次购买1200亿美元/月的债券。再见...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"FOMC聲明 6/16/2021","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：貨幣政策沒有變化。美聯儲仍然認爲通貨膨脹是暫時的\n並打算讓經濟熱起來，直到失業率下降纔開始加息。\n開始加息。仍在一次購買1200億美元/月的債券。再見...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1405224819814174726","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1405224819814174726","title":"Powell just announced he got outbid by an all-cash offer on a house and is now ready to raise rates","date":"June 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"Powellは、住宅購入の際に全額現金払いのオファーに負けたと発表したばかりで、今は利上げの準備をしている。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"鲍威尔刚刚宣布他被一个全现金报价的房子比下去了，现在准备加息了","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"鮑威爾剛剛宣佈他被一個全現金報價的房子比下去了，現在準備加息了","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e8a47f25-fec0-57c2-b66a-6141d51a75f8","excerpt":"JP Morgan today increased their price target for $CLF to $39, the highest\ncurrent price target.
