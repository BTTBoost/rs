Furthermore, the State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t just some publicity stunt/gimmick, it&#39;s full on requiring that &quot;every economic agent must accept Bitcoin as payment  when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.&quot; as mentioned in <strong>Article #7.</strong> Meaning if I go to Walmart and try to pay with Bitcoin, by law, Walmart MUST accept my Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>This is a bold move for El Salvador and a big milestone for Bitcoin. How do you think this will work out for El Salvador over the coming years? Will other countries follow?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>On a sidenote, Bitcoin is now officially considered Forex.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pjfu6y/in_two_hours_bitcoin_becomes_the_legal_currency/","title":"In two hours, Bitcoin becomes the legal currency of El Salvador","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-07T06:17:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-07 06:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pjfu6y","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pjfu6y/in_two_hours_bitcoin_becomes_the_legal_currency/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pjfu6y/in_two_hours_bitcoin_becomes_the_legal_currency/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ShotBot","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShotBot","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ShotBot","score":116,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2時間でビットコインがエルサルバドルの法定通貨になる","the_new_excerpt":"法律の全文を読む...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"两小时内，比特币成为萨尔瓦多的法定货币","the_new_excerpt":"阅读完整的法律...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"兩小時內，比特幣成爲薩爾瓦多的法定貨幣","the_new_excerpt":"閱讀完整的法律...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1435067544516321283","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1435067544516321283","title":"CANADIAN PRESIDENT HIT WITH ROCKS DUE TO COVID POLICIES https://t.co/Nud81xbSjb","date":"September 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"カナダ大統領、コヴィッド政策により石をぶつけられる https://t.co/Nud81xbSjb","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"加拿大总统因科威德政策而被石块击中 https://t.co/Nud81xbSjb","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"加拿大總統因科威德政策而被石塊擊中 https://t.co/Nud81xbSjb","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pjlzcs","excerpt":"Just last month, Guillermo Lasso, the president of Ecuador, issued Decree 151\nwhich focuses on a new mining policy, strengthening the government’s support\ntowards mining as a key driver of the economy.\n\nAccording to this article\n[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pjlzcs/the_new_mining_policy_in_ecuador_and_how_will_it/","title":"The new mining policy in Ecuador and how will it affect the country","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 07, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"エクアドルの新鉱業政策とその影響について","the_new_excerpt":"先月、エクアドルのギジェルモ・ラッソ大統領は、新しい鉱業政策を中心とした政令151号を発行しました。\nを発行しました。この法令は、新しい鉱業政策を中心に、政府の支援を強化するものです。\n鉱業は経済の重要な原動力であり、政府の支援を強化するものです。\n\nこの記事によると\n[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"厄瓜多尔的新矿业政策以及它将如何影响该国","the_new_excerpt":"就在上个月，厄瓜多尔总统吉列尔莫-拉索发布了第151号法令。\n该法令侧重于新的采矿政策，加强了政府对采矿业的支持，将其作为经济发展的主要动力。\n采矿业是经济发展的主要动力。\n\n根据这篇文章\n[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"厄瓜多爾的新礦業政策以及它將如何影響該國","the_new_excerpt":"就在上個月，厄瓜多爾總統吉列爾莫-拉索發佈了第151號法令。\n該法令側重於新的採礦政策，加強了政府對採礦業的支持，將其作爲經濟發展的主要動力。\n採礦業是經濟發展的主要動力。\n\n根據這篇文章\n[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pjfu6y","previousId":"TweetPost-1435067544516321283","nextId":"RedditPost-pjlzcs","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pjfu6y/in_two_hours_bitcoin_becomes_the_legal_currency/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
