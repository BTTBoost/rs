But then I realized the real product is the skateboard platform which is independently drivable which means you just need to fit a body on top of it and it can be literally any car you want. They were the first to implement drive by wire which aids in the adaptability of the platform. (A certain other American EV company has plans of changing their model to this soon)</p>\n\n<p>Investor Relations Day (6/17/21) main takeaway</p>\n\n<p>- VDL NEDCAR (Netherlands)</p>\n\n<p>o Will start production in 2022 - 1000 units</p>\n\n<p>- Oklahoma plant</p>\n\n<p>o Starts production in 2023 – 15,000 units</p>\n\n<p>o 300 Mil tax incentives from the State of Oklahoma ( This is huge)</p>\n\n<p>Speculation/rumors</p>\n\n<p>- New model this week</p>\n\n<p>o Sport/crossover type model</p>\n\n<p>- Former CEO at Apple</p>\n\n<p>o Many people speculate he’s over there to oversee the Apple top-hat that they will use on theCanoo platform. Apple is late to the EV game and wouldn’t be bringing competition to the table until 2024. It is speculated they will be using Canoo’s skateboard to cut down on the engineering.</p>\n\n<p>Catalysts</p>\n\n<p>- High Short interest ~ 30 %</p>\n\n<p>o Ortex Data (as of 6/20/2021)</p>\n\n<p>§ 100% utilization</p>\n\n<p>§ 33 mil shares on loan</p>\n\n<p>§ Days to cover ~ 5.71</p>\n\n<p>o IBorrow Data</p>\n\n<p>§ 100,000 shares available to shorts</p>\n\n<p>§ 25% short fee</p>\n\n<p>- Russell 3000 addition 6/25/21</p>\n\n<p>o Not sure how many shares they are buying but you might as well take them out of the float</p>\n\n<p>- New model</p>\n\n<p>o When is unveiling a new model ever bad news?</p>\n\n<p>Controversies</p>\n\n<p>- Changing of business model</p>\n\n<p>o This was what cause the downfall of the stock price for the most part. They abandoned their goals of licensing out the skateboard to Hyundai/Kia (in my opinion this is a good move for the long run)</p>\n\n<p>Hurdles</p>\n\n<p>- Restricted shares unlock - either happened Friday (6/18) or will happen Monday (6/21/21)</p>\n\n<p>o 150 mil shares- 60% of the shares are going to be unlocked.</p>\n\n<p>o  More shares for the shorts to short ( I believe)</p>\n\n<p>o  Tony Aquila (CEO) made sure to point out that the principal investors are in it for the long run during Investor Relations day. Which I hope it will mitigate a sell off.</p>\n\n<p>- Shorts - whatever happens it will be a major hurdle when market makers are motivated to keep the price low.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Sorry for the format, I wrote it out on a word doc and all of the indenting was gone as soon as I posted.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I forgot to emphasize that Canoo owns 100% of the IP. So The founder/CEO being hired by Apple is not going to be a vulnerability.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o4l227/goev_canoo_the_misunderstood_ticker_and_why_you/","title":"GOEV (Canoo) - The misunderstood ticker and why you should watch it","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-21T13:40:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-21 13:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0c93d093-f294-53cd-b843-30603bbd335b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o4l227/goev_canoo_the_misunderstood_ticker_and_why_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o4l227/goev_canoo_the_misunderstood_ticker_and_why_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"1oki_3","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/1oki_3","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"1oki_3","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GOEV（カヌー） - 誤解されているティッカーとその理由について","the_new_excerpt":"この会社に対する私の個人的見解\n\n- 私は2020年10月から何らかの形でこの会社に投資しています。\n\n- 最初は「醜い」ライフスタイルしか見えず、この会社を嫌いました。\nの車です。しかしその後、本当の製品は独立して運転できるスケートボード・プラットフォームであることに気づきました。\n独立して運転することができる、つまり...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"GOEV (Canoo) - 被误解的股票，以及为什么你应该关注它","the_new_excerpt":"我对这家公司的个人看法\n\n- 自2020年10月以来，我一直以某种形式投资于这家公司。\n\n- 乍一看，我讨厌这家公司，因为我所看到的只是 \"丑陋 \"的生活方式\n车辆。但后来我意识到真正的产品是滑板平台，它是可以独立驾驶的。\n是可以独立驾驶的，这意味着...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GOEV (Canoo) - 被誤解的股票，以及爲什麼你應該關注它","the_new_excerpt":"我對這家公司的個人看法\n\n- 自2020年10月以來，我一直以某種形式投資於這家公司。\n\n- 乍一看，我討厭這家公司，因爲我所看到的只是 \"醜陋 \"的生活方式\n車輛。但後來我意識到真正的產品是滑板平臺，它是可以獨立駕駛的。\n是可以獨立駕駛的，這意味着...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8162f125-a8e4-5875-b0fb-1c174097e35d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4s6tk/real_squeeze_starring_gme_bb_and_amc/","title":"'Real Squeeze' starring GME, BB and AMC","date":"June 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME、BB、AMCが主役の「リアル・スクイーズ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"由GME、BB和AMC主演的 \"真正的挤压\"。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"由GME、BB和AMC主演的 \"真正的擠壓\"。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-115e749d-2530-5514-a057-fe7fc3fb931d","excerpt":"Business analytics firm MicroStrategy\n[https://cryptoslate.com/companies/microstrategy/] has acquired 13,005 Bitcoin\n(BTC), CEO Michael Saylor said in a tweet today.
