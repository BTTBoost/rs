Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May’s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Amid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. </p>\n\n<p>We got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department’s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. </p>\n\n<p>These reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it’s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other “meme stocks” traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. </li>\n<li>AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. </li>\n<li>Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential &quot;supply constraints&quot; beginning in the summer after a &quot;more robust&quot; recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.</li>\n<li>Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue</li>\n<li>Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. </li>\n<li>Jack Ma&#39;s Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Thursday. This is one of the first step of Ant&#39;s forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that the current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes.*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Cigna<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CI&amp;src=cashtag_click\"> </a>(CI)target raised by Morgan Stanley from $254 to $321 at Overweight.
