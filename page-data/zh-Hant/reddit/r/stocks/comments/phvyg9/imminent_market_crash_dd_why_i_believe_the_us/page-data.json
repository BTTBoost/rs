I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn’t believe. I turned around and said “Sir… I’m sorry, what did you just say?” He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that <strong>last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food…he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So…when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at…I’m sure it’s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I’m not joking…<strong>at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.</strong> I couldn’t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew…we had fucked up. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\">https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1</a></p>\n\n<p>After already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) </p>\n\n<p>I immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. <strong>I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.</strong> Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.</p>\n\n<p>Now this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I’m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.</p>\n\n<pre><code>              Technical Analysis\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let me start with my TA  first…which is alarming. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX\">https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>$SPY is at a critical resistance level…I mean…it literally is hitting the fucking roof here</strong>… and with everything going on in the world…you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble…but how was that even theoretically feasible? It’s impossible in my opinion. </p>\n\n<p>Let me explain why…</p>\n\n<pre><code>          Updated GDP Forecasts\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret…THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!</strong></p>\n\n<p>For fucks sake people, <strong>THIS IS HUGE!!</strong> This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! </p>\n\n<p><strong>“The team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>I can’t make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to read… I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. I’m actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally read…I wish I was joking. Whatever…weird. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So…yeah we’re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie’s future earnings… and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now…</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>                 Lumber/Gold Ratio\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>When gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.</p>\n\n<p>Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ\">https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ</a> </p>\n\n<p>The lumber/gold ratio <strong>HAS PLUMMETED</strong> in the last 2 months…literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember…play defense)</p>\n\n<p>Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But…gold was up big this week as well…and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.</p>\n\n<pre><code>            Consumer Confidence\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So…for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy…were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9….a very surprising miss. I wasn’t surprised at all to be honest with you.</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>                  Conclusion\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Let me be clear…I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it’s going to collapse our financial system possibly…also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant “Mu” and mass evictions will soon begin…</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.</strong></p>\n\n<p>No big deal right? </p>\n\n<p><strong>This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.</strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\">https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP</a></p>\n\n<p>No big deal right?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.</strong> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\">https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi</a></p>\n\n<p>No big deal right? </p>\n\n<p><strong>I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on…. But you get the point by now…let’s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I’m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don’t get me started on the mass evictions as well…and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities… The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now…<strong>my positions.</strong> Take this into consideration… I’m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So…Not financial advice. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Short term:</strong> sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold</p>\n\n<p>Bought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp </p>\n\n<p><strong>Long term:</strong></p>\n\n<p>One $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks… I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. </p>\n\n<p>2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It’s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. <strong>There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.</strong> You can bet on that. </p>\n\n<p>1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)</p>\n\n<p>One $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I’m wrong) </p>\n\n<p><strong>My last position:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>$2,500 in Cash.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Simply put…<strong>cash is a position.</strong> People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies… my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me… I already have my shopping list ready. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck out there guys. <strong>Timing this is almost impossible</strong>…but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It’s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a “Black swan event”by purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars…Let me remind you that they deal with information.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit…</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/phvyg9/imminent_market_crash_dd_why_i_believe_the_us/","title":"Imminent Market Crash DD.
