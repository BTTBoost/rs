I probably should just cut my losses but I feel like if the big boys have some tricks up their sleeves maybe so do some of you.</p>\n\n<p>In the long term I was thinking about potentially averaging down my cost per share to try and sell at a break even if possible. This would obviously expose me to even more risk BUT... for example, say the price were to drop to around 20 dollars per share if I bought 500 shares this would bring my average cost to about $38.6. However, I&#39;ve never done something like this so I&#39;m not entirely sure how the math would work out in the end.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously we don&#39;t know how to future of Gamestop will pan out, maybe it&#39;s worth around $100 in a few years like Chewy or it goes the route of KB toys and ceases to exist. What I do know is I played myself and took home a very expensive lesson lol.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lb0zio/risk_mitigation_how_can_i_soften_the_blow/","title":"risk mitigation: how can I soften the blow","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T19:47:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 19:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"eca2ace0-2838-52f7-8b54-6d5bf8bc6604","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb0zio/risk_mitigation_how_can_i_soften_the_blow/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb0zio/risk_mitigation_how_can_i_soften_the_blow/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"41351865132435","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/41351865132435","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"41351865132435","score":169,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"降低风险：如何才能减轻打击？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我买了GameStop对整个崩溃的开始，与44股\n平均股价约为250美元。我承认，我让贪婪得到最好的。\n尽管上周有很多次我只想一走了之。\n用钱我没有。哦，好吧。\n\n所有说和做，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"降低風險：如何才能減輕打擊？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我買了GameStop對整個崩潰的開始，與44股\n平均股價約爲250美元。我承認，我讓貪婪得到最好的。\n儘管上週有很多次我只想一走了之。\n用錢我沒有。哦，好吧。\n\n所有說和做，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-52e3de4c-1b6e-53ac-be04-f89270520622","excerpt":"I’ve been dollar cost averaging for the past 4 years and I decided to spice it\nup last week by hopping onto the GME train.
