Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.</p>\n\n<p>Notable Numbers Today</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SPY: -0.19%</li>\n<li>QQQ: +0.56%</li>\n<li>DIA: -0.76%</li>\n<li>Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%</li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL): +1.70%</li>\n<li>NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%</li>\n<li>Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%</li>\n<li>PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%</li>\n<li>Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Markets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. </p>\n\n<p>Jim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.”</p>\n\n<p>In particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said “Just like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.</p>\n\n<p>Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low.
