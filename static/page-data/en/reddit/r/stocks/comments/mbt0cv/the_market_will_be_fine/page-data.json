Here is the best explanation i found: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/pension-funds-have-to-buy-bonds-to-rebalance-portfolios-and-that-might-be-good-for-stocks.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/pension-funds-have-to-buy-bonds-to-rebalance-portfolios-and-that-might-be-good-for-stocks.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In short, it looks like a lot of big pension funds sold a lot of stocks to buy bonds as their quarterly rebalancing. This explains why the Yields actually went down a lot while the rest of the market as a whole was tanking.</p>\n\n<p>But if you noticed, one thing did well: FAANG. Why? because analysts expect the yields going down to help the large cap growth stocks.</p>\n\n<p>But i think once the large funds are done rebalancing, people will buy back into the market for sure with the low yields, and we should see growth doing better.</p>\n\n<p>I think the most important thing is to not panic and hold to our red positions... If the feds was able to save us from a massive covid crash, they can save us from a tiny dip that was caused by literally nothing lol</p>\n\n<p>Note: I expect April could still be volatile, but i really think the summer will good to us, and Q4 even better =)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mbt0cv/the_market_will_be_fine/","title":"The market will be fine","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-24T03:02:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-24 03:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7497e912-987d-5bf8-939f-b777c39a8f92","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mbt0cv/the_market_will_be_fine/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mbt0cv/the_market_will_be_fine/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Floofyboy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Floofyboy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Floofyboy","score":258,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"市场会好起来的","the_new_excerpt":"今天让很多人着急了，因为今天的天气相当的差，因为没有。\n显而易见的原因。这里是我找到的最好的解释。\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/pension-funds-have-to-buy-bonds-to-rebalance-portfolios-and-that-might-be-good-for-stocks.html\n\n总之，它看起来像很多大...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場會好起來的","the_new_excerpt":"今天讓很多人着急了，因爲今天的天氣相當的差，因爲沒有。\n顯而易見的原因。這裏是我找到的最好的解釋。\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/pension-funds-have-to-buy-bonds-to-rebalance-portfolios-and-that-might-be-good-for-stocks.html\n\n總之，它看起來像很多大...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1374447297627492353","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1374447297627492353","title":"The Russell 2000 is down ~4% today. \n\nThis is why stocks are risky and should be avoided at all costs.","date":"March 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"罗素2000指数今天下跌了约4%。\n\n这就是为什么股票有风险，应该不惜一切代价避免的原因。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"羅素2000指數今天下跌了約4%。\n\n這就是爲什麼股票有風險，應該不惜一切代價避免的原因。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-d69e2fcc-c439-56f9-b734-1760c41b287e","excerpt":"Hey guys, I’m really struggling right now.
