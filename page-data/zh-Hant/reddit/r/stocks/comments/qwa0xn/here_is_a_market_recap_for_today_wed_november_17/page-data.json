Here are the numbers</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected</li>\n<li>Core Retail Sales: +1.6%</li>\n<li>Manufacturing Production: +1.2%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. </p>\n\n<p>Steven Wieting, Citigroup’s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, “The markets generally are looking at it [the pace of inflation], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct – it’s benign for markets. It doesn’t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.”</p>\n\n<p>Today, Target (TGT) and Lowe’s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):</p>\n\n<p><strong>Target (TGT)</strong>: “With a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,&quot; said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion</li>\n<li>Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%</li>\n<li>Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%</li>\n<li>Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%</li>\n<li>Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Lowe’s (LOW):</strong> “Our momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management”, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion </li>\n<li>Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36</li>\n<li>$1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020</li>\n<li>Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The party seems over… after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I’d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy</li>\n<li>CME Group (CME) the world&#39;s largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. </li>\n<li>Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y</li>\n<li>Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. </li>\n<li>According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity\">https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity</a></li>\n<li>Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company&#39;s Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US. </li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current price target are written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with two target raises.
