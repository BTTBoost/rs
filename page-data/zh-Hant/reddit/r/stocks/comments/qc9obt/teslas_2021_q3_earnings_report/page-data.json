We achieved our best-ever net income, operating profit and gross profit. Additionally, we reached an operating margin of 14.6%, exceeding our medium-term guidance of “operating margin in low-teens”.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps more impressively, this level of profitability was achieved while our ASP2 decreased by 6% YoY in Q3 due to continued mix shift towards lower-priced vehicles. Our operating margin reached an all-time high as we continue to reduce cost at a higher rate than declines in ASP.\nEV demand continues to go through a structural shift. </p>\n\n<p>We believe the more vehicles we have on the road, the more Tesla owners are able to spread the word about the benefits of EVs. While Fremont factory produced more cars in the last 12 months than in any other year, we believe there is room for continued improvement. Additionally, we continue to ramp Gigafactory Shanghai and build new capacity in Texas and Berlin.</p>\n\n<p>A variety of challenges, including semiconductor shortages, congestion at ports and rolling blackouts, have been impacting our ability to keep factories running at full speed. We believe our supply chain, engineering and production teams have been dealing with these global challenges with ingenuity, agility and flexibility that is unparalleled in the automotive industry. We would like to thank everyone who helps advance our mission.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/TWPKBV_TSLA_Q3_2021_Quarterly_Update_SI1AKE.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2021-Quarterly-Update.pdf%22\">Link for the report</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/tesla-tsla-earnings-q3-2021.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard\">Link for analyst estimates</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qc9obt/teslas_2021_q3_earnings_report/","title":"Tesla’s 2021 Q3 Earnings Report","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-20T21:53:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-20 21:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qc9obt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qc9obt/teslas_2021_q3_earnings_report/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qc9obt/teslas_2021_q3_earnings_report/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"juaggo_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/juaggo_","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"juaggo_","score":305,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テスラの2021年第3四半期決算報告","the_new_excerpt":"アナリスト予想\n\n一株当たり利益（調整後）：1.86ドル（Refinitiv社予想1.59ドル\n\n売上高：137億6,000万ドル（予想136億3,000万ドル）（Refinitiv調べ\n\nキャッシュ\n\n第3四半期の営業キャッシュフローから設備投資を差し引いたフリーキャッシュフローは13億ドル\n\n第3四半期の負債およびファイナンス・リースの純返済額は15億ドル\n\n合計で164百万ドル...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"特斯拉2021年第三季度收益报告","the_new_excerpt":"分析师估计\n\n每股收益（调整后）：1.86美元，预期1.59美元/Refinitiv\n\n收入：137.6亿美元，预期136.3亿美元。\n\n现金\n\n第三季度的运营现金流减去资本支出（自由现金流）为13亿美元\n\n第三季度净债务和融资租赁偿还额为15亿美元\n\n总共有1.64亿美元...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉2021年第三季度收益報告","the_new_excerpt":"分析師估計\n\n每股收益（調整後）：1.86美元，預期1.59美元/Refinitiv\n\n收入：137.6億美元，預期136.3億美元。\n\n現金\n\n第三季度的運營現金流減去資本支出（自由現金流）爲13億美元\n\n第三季度淨債務和融資租賃償還額爲15億美元\n\n總共有1.64億美元...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qc8ksj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qc8ksj/this_generation_will_change_the_world/","title":"“This generation will change the world “","date":"October 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"この世代が世界を変える\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"这一代人将改变世界\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"這一代人將改變世界\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qc2a7y","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qc2a7y/thanks_bubble_boys_stocks_only_go_up/","title":"Thanks bubble boys - Stocks only go up","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 20, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Thanks bubble boys - Stocks only go up","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"谢谢泡沫男孩--股票只会上涨","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"謝謝泡沫男孩--股票只會上漲","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qc9obt","previousId":"RedditPost-qc8ksj","nextId":"RedditPost-qc2a7y","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qc9obt/teslas_2021_q3_earnings_report/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
