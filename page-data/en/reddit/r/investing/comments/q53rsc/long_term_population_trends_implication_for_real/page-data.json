However that price run up has been predicated both on the largest population explosion in human history, as well as artificial construction of supply, by NIMBYs and zoning laws in many parts of the world. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve always assumed that, aside from occasional collapses, real estate will continue to drift upwards, perhaps not a great investment compared to other assets, but better than inflation. </p>\n\n<p>The possibility exists of long term reversal of both of these supporting trends. Zoning laws are becoming threatened due to political backlash from how unaffordable housing has become. At the same time life in general has become so unaffordable that fertility rates are now strongly below replacement values in most of the developed world. </p>\n\n<p>Can’t say anything with any certainty of course, but I think a future of continued growth of housing prices for the next century isn’t a guarantee. Sounds obvious when I write it out, but psychologically I had a deep seated assumption that the housing market was a guaranteed success long term.  Think that may require a rethink. </p>\n\n<p>If population trends down in the developed world, that’s a possible future to consider when choosing investments. Fewer people could depress real prices of stocks in general.  Kind of difficult to know what types of companies would perform well in this scenario. I suppose technology companies specializing in automation (AI and robotics) is the only market I can think of that would do well. Commodities, construction, non-durables, energy, all of those seem to be at risk from a general long-term decline in population and therefore in aggregate demand. </p>\n\n<p>Again not saying this will happen, but personally I feel as though I had not given enough thought to this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q53rsc/long_term_population_trends_implication_for_real/","title":"Long term population trends, implication for real estate and other markets","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-10T20:41:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-10 20:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q53rsc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q53rsc/long_term_population_trends_implication_for_real/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q53rsc/long_term_population_trends_implication_for_real/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ButtBlock","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ButtBlock","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ButtBlock","score":83,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"長期的な人口動向、不動産やその他の市場への影響","the_new_excerpt":"今夜は、不動産が過去に比べてますます高くなり続けていることについて考えていました。\nこの70年の間に、不動産はどんどん高くなっていった（つまり良い投資になった）。しかし、この価格上昇は\nしかし、その価格上昇は、人類史上最大の人口爆発と、人工的な建築物の建設を前提としています。\nしかし、この価格上昇は、人類史上最大の人口爆発と、人為的な供給の構築の両方を前提としています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"长期的人口趋势，对房地产和其他市场的影响","the_new_excerpt":"今晚在想，房地产是如何持续变得越来越贵的？\n在过去的70年里，房地产的价格越来越高，（也就是说，是一项好的投资）。然而，这种价格\n是以人类历史上最大的人口爆炸为前提的。\n以及人工建设的供应，由...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"長期的人口趨勢，對房地產和其他市場的影響","the_new_excerpt":"今晚在想，房地產是如何持續變得越來越貴的？\n在過去的70年裏，房地產的價格越來越高，（也就是說，是一項好的投資）。然而，這種價格\n是以人類歷史上最大的人口爆炸爲前提的。\n以及人工建設的供應，由...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q5cn2g","excerpt":"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said the September jobs report reflects “great\nprogress” in getting the U.S. economy back on track after a year and a half of\nCovid-19 pandemic disruption, even as the overall jobs number came in lower than\nexpected.\n\n“Today, for the first time since March of 2020,…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q5cn2g/biden_sees_great_progress_in_rising_wages_does/","title":"Biden sees 'great progress' in rising wages.
