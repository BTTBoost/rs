Their S1-A prospectus released on Nov 1 is available here:\n<a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-315537/\">https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-315537/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>THE IPO FUNDAMENTALS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some key elements to pull out of here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>861M shares total</li>\n<li>155M shares available during IPO (135M for public, 20M for underwriters)</li>\n<li>PT of $62</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This gives RIVN a market cap of $55Bn with the goal of raising $8Bn in funding during this IPO.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE COMPANY FINANCIALS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Right now, RIVN has zero revenue. Consider them like QuantumScape. They&#39;re set to release product soon, but they have no commercialized product currently.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, they racked up total operational net losses of $1Bn. In 2021, they&#39;re on track for net losses of $2Bn. These are all costs associated with what they term as &quot;Research and development&quot; and &quot;Selling, general, and administrative&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Their goal is to operate in the truck market initially, focusing on consumer truck/SUV vehicles and then delivery fleet vehicles (EDV). This is similar to what WKHS/RIDE were trying to accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>The S1 has RIVN projecting Amazon buying 100,000 EDVs from them, and growing the preorders of their R1T and R1S consumer models.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE PRODUCT</strong></p>\n\n<p>RIVN is focusing on the SUV/Truck market, and this makes sense for America as trucks and SUVs consistently outsell all other vehicles on the road. Based on reviews, the R1T is ranked at 4th place comparing against other EVs by Car and Driver:\n<a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/rivian/r1t\">https://www.caranddriver.com/rivian/r1t</a></p>\n\n<p>The R1T looks like a truck, and is designed very much to provide the culturally American truck experience. With the Cybertruck delayed into 2022, RIVN may have the first mover advantage, but again its hard to compare to TSLA who is just a runaway behemoth and cult brand at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Car and Driver&#39;s review glow about Rivian&#39;s offroad and rugged capabilities. It really seems to live up to the hype. Though there are worries about battery efficacy compared to the ModelX. The R1T is priced $30k cheaper than the ModelX.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon invested $700M into Rivian to develop EDVs that plan to go on the road by 2022:\n<a href=\"https://electrek.co/guides/rivian/\">https://electrek.co/guides/rivian/</a></p>\n\n<p>Ford was invested for $500M, but pulled out after COVID hit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE LEADERSHIP</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Forbes did a piece on the CEO of Rivian: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/meet-r-j-scaringe-founder-of-rivian-automotive-and-teslas-worst-nightmare/\">https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/meet-r-j-scaringe-founder-of-rivian-automotive-and-teslas-worst-nightmare/</a></p>\n\n<p>RJ Scaringe is a MechEng PhD from MIT, who founded Rivian in 2009 as Mainstream Motors. The deep story is that RJ Scaringe worked on cars growing up in Florida and also liked outdoors and hiking. So he put the two together to create this company: <a href=\"https://electrek.co/guides/rivian/\">https://electrek.co/guides/rivian/</a></p>\n\n<p>Unlike Trevor Milton (where Rivian drives a lot of comparison to NKLA), Scaringe has a background in tech. Milton dropped out of university to go pursue sales and marketing. He sold alarms and used cars before founding NKLA. While leadership trust in NKLA was suspect, I think Scaringe has more credibility and accountability.</p>\n\n<p>I speak about leadership because in this high risk, volatile and speculative companies like RIVN (they haven&#39;t delivered any real products yet, its an emerging market, etc), trust in leadership is as important as the performance of the company. It&#39;s hard to differentiate TSLA from Musk. </p>\n\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n\n<p>Is RIVN worth $62? I think there will be some serious short term volatility. Its hard to value a company at $60Bn when they haven&#39;t even delivered any real products at scale yet. And TSLA gigafactory manufacturing strategy creates a sunk cost moat to scale production to compete. But its hard to go against American cultural trends where trucks rule supreme.</p>\n\n<p>If you do buy RIVN at $62, expect to hold for at least 3 years for their fleet operations to come into focus. Also, create a strategy to handle huge downside swings based on bad news around supply chains and TSLA competition.</p>\n\n<p>I think RIVN is a gut play, and there could be short term volatility since it has a nosebleed valuation for its current deliverables.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qmllp4/rivn_ipo_on_november_10/","title":"RIVN IPO on November 10","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-05T10:16:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-05 10:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qmllp4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qmllp4/rivn_ipo_on_november_10/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qmllp4/rivn_ipo_on_november_10/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"radarbot","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/radarbot","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"radarbot","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"RIVNのIPOは11月10日","the_new_excerpt":"リビアンは注目度の高いIPOを目指しています。11月1日に発表されたS1-A目論見書は\nこちらからご覧いただけます： https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-315537/\n\nIPOの基礎知識\n\nここでは、いくつかの重要な要素を紹介します。\n\n * 総株式数 861M\n * IPO期間中に利用可能な株式数は1億5500万株（一般向けに1億3500万株、...向けに2000万株）。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"RIVN于11月10日进行IPO","the_new_excerpt":"Rivian将有一次高调的IPO。他们在11月1日发布的S1-A招股说明书\n1日发布的S1-A招股说明书，可在此查阅：https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-315537/\n\nIPO的基本原理\n\n从这里可以看出一些关键因素。\n\n * 8.61亿股股票总数\n * 首次公开募股期间有1.55亿股（1.35亿股用于公开募股，2000万股用于公开募股）。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"RIVN於11月10日進行IPO","the_new_excerpt":"Rivian將有一次高調的IPO。他們在11月1日發佈的S1-A招股說明書\n1日發佈的S1-A招股說明書，可在此查閱：https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-315537/\n\nIPO的基本原理\n\n從這裏可以看出一些關鍵因素。\n\n * 8.61億股股票總數\n * 首次公開募股期間有1.55億股（1.35億股用於公開募股，2000萬股用於公開募股）。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qmz1oy","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qmz1oy/theres_no_other_way/","title":"There's no other way","date":"November 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"他に方法はありません。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"没有其他办法","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"沒有其他辦法","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1455988107300507651","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1455988107300507651","title":"S&amp;P 500 closes at an all-time high for the 62nd time this year.
