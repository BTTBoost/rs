It&#39;s a huge company, on everyone&#39;s radar and has been for years. But I think the market is still underestimating its potential. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start with the basics. They have consistently blown up earnings. Most recently, revenue was up 60% yoy, income up 166%, and profit margin up 64%. Their P/E is around 30, which is high, but consistent with other tech stocks. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that a large chunk of their income is invested into high-risk/high-reward research. This inflates the P/E because it cuts down earnings even though the investments improve the potential for larger returns in the future.</p>\n\n<p>They have what I believe to be the largest moat in the tech sector due to their sheer size, their collection of patents, and their reputation that attracts elite tech workers and researchers. </p>\n\n<p>That all makes a bull case from their bread-and-butter profit-making, but all of that is arguably priced in and somewhat similar to other large tech companies. So, why do I think that GOOG is not just a bull, but a *raging* bull? Their research divisions. They have their hand in just about every potentially explosive area of research. </p>\n\n<p>AI/machine learning? I&#39;m a researcher in a field that is tangent to machine learning. Google, DeepMind, GoogleBrain (all under Alphabet=GOOGL/GOOG) are all considered among the most elite places to work in the field. For example, AlphaFold recently created a breakthrough algorithm to simulate protein folding, with a potential to revolutionize drug design. There are lots of good machine learning startups out there, and most of their leaders dream of being bought by GOOG. </p>\n\n<p>Quantum Computing? Google&#39;s QuantumAI is breaking new ground so fast that public, government-backed projects can&#39;t keep up. No other large company has their hand in this, potentially high-reward, field right now.</p>\n\n<p>Microchips? Google designed their own TPUs, which are better than GPUs for machine learning, etc. How many software companies design their own chips?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe none of those ever take off for Alphabet, but they&#39;ll keep acquiring researchers and companies on the cutting edge of technology and some of them will eventually blast off.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, whatever new tech-related industry blasts off next, you can be sure that Alphabet will have their finger in the pie, if they don&#39;t have the whole pie to themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure: I own two tickers, VTI (88%) and GOOG (12%). </p>\n\n<p>GOOG is down 5% in the last month and I have cash, so I&#39;ll probably buy a bunch more. I&#39;d like to hear some bears talk some sense into me before I make the purchase.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q211wx/a_raging_bull_case_for_googlgoog/","title":"A raging bull case for GOOGL/GOOG","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-06T07:05:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-06 07:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q211wx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q211wx/a_raging_bull_case_for_googlgoog/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q211wx/a_raging_bull_case_for_googlgoog/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ProfOnTheMove","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ProfOnTheMove","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ProfOnTheMove","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GOOGL/GOOGのレイジングブルケース","the_new_excerpt":"明らかにGoogleは隠れた名機ではありません。誰もが注目する大企業です。\n何年も前からそうでした。しかし、市場はまだその可能性を過小評価していると思います。\n思うのです。\n\nまずは基本的なことから始めましょう。彼らは一貫して収益を爆発させてきました。最近では\n最近では、売上高は前年同期比60％増、利益は166％増、そして...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对GOOGL/GOOG的愤怒的公牛案例","the_new_excerpt":"显然，谷歌并不是什么隐藏的宝石。它是一个巨大的公司，在每个人的雷达上\n而且多年来一直如此。但我认为市场仍然低估了它的\n潜力。\n\n让我们从基本面开始。他们的收益一直都是爆棚的。大多数\n最近，收入同比增长了60%，收入增长了166%，而...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對GOOGL/GOOG的憤怒的公牛案例","the_new_excerpt":"顯然，谷歌並不是什麼隱藏的寶石。它是一個巨大的公司，在每個人的雷達上\n而且多年來一直如此。但我認爲市場仍然低估了它的\n潛力。\n\n讓我們從基本面開始。他們的收益一直都是爆棚的。大多數\n最近，收入同比增長了60%，收入增長了166%，而...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q23dsd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q23dsd/were_making_the_world_more_tranparent/","title":"\"We'Re MaKiNg ThE wOrLd MoRe TrAnPaReNt\"","date":"October 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"We're MaKiNg ThOrLd MoRe TrAnPaReNt\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"我们正在努力使世界变得更加安全\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"我們正在努力使世界變得更加安全\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q2dnka","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2dnka/in_theaters_tomorrow/","title":"In Theaters Tomorrow","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 06, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"明日からの劇場公開","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"明天上映","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"明天上映","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q211wx","previousId":"RedditPost-q23dsd","nextId":"RedditPost-q2dnka","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q211wx/a_raging_bull_case_for_googlgoog/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
