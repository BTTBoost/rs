I discovered something about myself and I wanted to share. I just started investing last year and dabbled in this and that. Made couple thousand in NIO and TSLA rise but nothing to write home about.</p>\n\n<p>I went in on GME with my life savings at around $44, and was up about 500k. I fell victim to the moving goalpost and didn&#39;t sell. I sold while it was crashing and netted about 90k profits. I have no reason to complain and I learned so many valuable lessons. The nature of man&#39;s greed, the importance to locking in profits, not counting chickens before they hatch, etc. I got lost in my vision of what I could do with that money, not when it was at 460 but at 1000 etc.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago if someone told me that I was going to make about 85k post tax plus my initial investment back, I would have jumped for joy. But I&#39;m going through depression that I missed out on the 500k and I wake up from sleeping with flashing pangs of regret. I know it&#39;s just the start of my lifelong investment career, and I&#39;ll have more opportunities. Pain is all relative. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, money is so easy to make. Other times, it&#39;s the hardest thing to accumulate.</p>\n\n<p>Always be happy with your profits, green is green, take home what you can while you can.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ld1yva/getting_over_depression_over_money/","title":"Getting over depression over money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T13:32:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 13:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"61c56d01-0fdc-541c-94ef-b9bf5a232be1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ld1yva/getting_over_depression_over_money/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ld1yva/getting_over_depression_over_money/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"republicj","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/republicj","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"republicj","score":115,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"摆脱对金钱的忧郁","the_new_excerpt":"我没有权利抱怨，我也不是在寻求同情。I\n发现了一些关于自己的东西，我想分享。我刚刚开始\n去年投资，涉足了这个那个。赚了几千块钱的NIO\n和TSLA的上涨，但没有什么好写的。\n\n我在GME上用我的生命... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"擺脫對金錢的憂鬱","the_new_excerpt":"我沒有權利抱怨，我也不是在尋求同情。I\n發現了一些關於自己的東西，我想分享。我剛剛開始\n去年投資，涉足了這個那個。賺了幾千塊錢的NIO\n和TSLA的上漲，但沒有什麼好寫的。\n\n我在GME上用我的生命... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1d52c912-3e97-5d2b-82f3-d686fb843531","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld3cfo/ok_whos_still_holding/","title":"OK, WHO'S STILL HOLDING ?!?! 💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🚀🚀🚀","date":"February 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"好了，谁还拿着呢！？💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"好了，誰還拿着呢！？💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-13cb3594-d868-5a77-9b94-bdc93be4c01c","excerpt":"I've been around here mostly lurking for about 1-1.5 years and the diversity\nfrom content back then vs now and all the recent events... has changed a lot.\nThere's tons of misleading information and even if a DD seems legit, you should\nalways double-triple check and follow your own interests and gut…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ld556u/now_is_the_time_to_be_especially_weary_what_you/","title":"Now is the time to be especially weary what you believe or invest in","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 05, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"现在是时候特别要警惕你所相信或投资的东西。","the_new_excerpt":"我在这里主要是潜伏了1-1.5年左右，多元化的。\n从当时的内容与现在的内容以及最近发生的所有事件来看......已经发生了很大的变化。\n有大量的误导性信息，即使一个DD看起来合法，你也应该\n一定要三思而后行，按照自己的兴趣和直觉... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在是時候特別要警惕你所相信或投資的東西。","the_new_excerpt":"我在這裏主要是潛伏了1-1.5年左右，多元化的。\n從當時的內容與現在的內容以及最近發生的所有事件來看......已經發生了很大的變化。\n有大量的誤導性信息，即使一個DD看起來合法，你也應該\n一定要三思而後行，按照自己的興趣和直覺... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-61c56d01-0fdc-541c-94ef-b9bf5a232be1","previousId":"RedditPost-1d52c912-3e97-5d2b-82f3-d686fb843531","nextId":"RedditPost-13cb3594-d868-5a77-9b94-bdc93be4c01c","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ld1yva/getting_over_depression_over_money/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
