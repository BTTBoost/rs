Also, I&#39;m not saying we pump this stock this is just my DD so mods please don&#39;t remove my post again I put in a decent bit of effort lol and this isn&#39;t another shit post. </p>\n\n<p>First, CRSR is trading at a P/E of just 20 which is extremely low compared to the previous growth it&#39;s had. Of course, CRSR can&#39;t sustain their growth from last year but they will continue to grow nonetheless. Their competitors such as Logitech are trading at slightly higher P/E&#39;s yet are 7x the size of them indicating once again how low their P/E is for their sector.</p>\n\n<p>Then, their free cash flow is very strong. With most companies I would like to see them trading at around a 20x free cash flow or 25x if their growth is strong. For a company like Corsair 20x seems low and 25x would seem reasonable yet they are trading at just 16x FREE CASH FLOW. N</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention they are trading at a P/S of less than 2 and I understand that they have low margins but this is still very good for a relatively small company. Additionally, with Corsairs strong cash on hand this provides them with the opportunity to possibly improve their management or put more money into paid promotions with youtube/twitch streamers which I believe is much needed.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, when I used my DCF model assuming 11% growth for the next 3 years, then 9 percent growth for the next 3 after that, and lastly 8 percent growth for the next 3 years then CRSR has a margin of safety 28% and an intrinsic share value of 41. Also remember, I am assuming somewhat conservative growth numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, one of the main arguments against CRSR is that they cannot maintain their growth from last year and they will in fact shrink but this was proven completely wrong in q1 of 2021 where they continued to grow.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o32k9u/why_im_bullish_on_crsr/","title":"Why I'm bullish on CRSR","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-19T16:37:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-19 16:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"17c060f1-0d02-5de9-9161-9a7818b17492","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o32k9u/why_im_bullish_on_crsr/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o32k9u/why_im_bullish_on_crsr/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Miladyboi","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miladyboi","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Miladyboi","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私がCRSRに強気な理由","the_new_excerpt":"前置きが長くなりましたが、私はバッグホルダーではありません。\n私は会社に投資していますが、35とかいう非常に高いコストベースを持っているわけではありません。\nのような非常に高いコストベースは持っていません。また、この株を買おうと言っているわけではありませんが、これはあくまでも私の考えです。\nどうか、私の投稿を再び削除しないでください。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我为什么看涨CRSRR？","the_new_excerpt":"我想先说一下，我不是一个袋子的持有者，虽然我在公司投资，但我没有疯狂的成本基础，就像35或35岁的人一样。\n虽然我在公司投资，但我没有一个疯狂的成本基础，比如说35或什么的。\n什么的。另外，我不是说我们要抽走这只股票，这只是我的DD，所以mods\n请不要再删除我的帖子，我付出了相当大的努力...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我爲什麼看漲CRSRR？","the_new_excerpt":"我想先說一下，我不是一個袋子的持有者，雖然我在公司投資，但我沒有瘋狂的成本基礎，就像35或35歲的人一樣。\n雖然我在公司投資，但我沒有一個瘋狂的成本基礎，比如說35或什麼的。\n什麼的。另外，我不是說我們要抽走這隻股票，這只是我的DD，所以mods\n請不要再刪除我的帖子，我付出了相當大的努力...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8b9c3fe3-3a5d-5983-814f-9e4239a93c02","excerpt":"im drunk. its late. just scrolling around and looking at people yell at each\nother about fake numbers that at best are loosely tied to reality and actual\nmaterial goods. y'all just be chill, its all fake. were all just throwing money\nat fake shit hoping to get money from the fake numbers. just be…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3cj1s/im_drunk_stocks_are_fake_everyone_just_be_fucking/","title":"im drunk, stocks are fake, everyone just be fucking chill and nice to each other","date":"June 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私は酔っていて、株は偽物で、みんなはただ冷静に、そしてお互いに親切にしてください。","the_new_excerpt":"酔っ払っていて、遅くなっていて、ただスクロールしていて、人々がお互いに叫んでいるのを見ていた。\nただ、スクロールして、せいぜい現実と実際の物との結びつきが弱い偽の数字について、人々がお互いに怒鳴り合っているのを見ているだけです。\nみんな冷静になって、全部偽物だから、お金を稼ごうと思って偽物にお金を投じているだけなんだよ。\n捏造された数字からお金を得ようと、捏造されたクソにお金を投じているだけだ。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我喝醉了，股票是假的，大家都他妈的冷静点，对彼此好点。","the_new_excerpt":"我喝醉了。很晚了。只是四处滚动，看着人们互相谩骂。\n你们都冷静点，这都是假的。\n你们都冷静一下，这都是假的。\n希望从假的数字中得到钱。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我喝醉了，股票是假的，大家都他媽的冷靜點，對彼此好點。","the_new_excerpt":"我喝醉了。很晚了。只是四處滾動，看着人們互相謾罵。\n你們都冷靜點，這都是假的。\n你們都冷靜一下，這都是假的。\n希望從假的數字中得到錢。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c9376aa3-ded3-5ce7-9295-1dec2bb2b8f2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3386j/wish_all_in_with_my_fathers_inheritance_imma_make/","title":"$WISH 🚀 ALL IN with my father’s inheritance!
