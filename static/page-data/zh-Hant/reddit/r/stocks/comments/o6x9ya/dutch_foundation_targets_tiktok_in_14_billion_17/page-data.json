According to SOMI, TikTok is violating multiple European laws, including privacy laws and laws that prohibit targeting advertisements at children. The app also doesn&#39;t properly ask permission for data use, and does not say which data is collected for which purposes. And the Chinese company behind the app collects and stores more data than necessary, and doesn&#39;t meet the legal requirements for keeping that data safe, the foundation said. </p>\n\n<p>SOMI also believes that TikTok doesn&#39;t comply with European media rules that are intended to &quot;protect children from harmful content&quot;, partly referring to online challenges in which children challenge each other to do dangerous things. &quot;SOMI also believes that more general videos on TikTok can be harmful to young children, for example because of hidden advertisements for harmful products and content that promotes unrealistic ideals of beauty, which can lead to problems such as self-harm and eating disorders.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The foundation&#39;s hope for this case is to get a legal ruling that forces TikTok to adjust its actions. &quot;A court decision can directly restrict the practices of TikTok - and other social media platforms,&quot; SOMI co-founder Cor Wijtvliet said to the broadcaster. &quot;We have sent letters of complaints to TikTok and several European supervisory authorities in the past year, but have not seen any substantive results. That is why we have decided not to wait for the investigations by the authorities and to take legal action ourselves.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for TikTok told RTL Nieuws that the privacy and safety of its users have &quot;the highest priority&quot;. &quot;We are taking industry-leading steps to promote youth security on TikTok, such as setting accounts to Private by default for users under the age of 16, and enabling parents to link their account to their teenage child&#39;s through Family Pairing. We continue to evaluate and improve our policies, processes and systems, and continue to consult with external experts.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Officially, TikTok can only be used by children aged 13 or older, and minors need their parents&#39; permission. In practice, however, these age limits are not well enforced. Earlier this year, a court in Italy ordered TikTok to block users who did not confirm their age, after a 10-year-old girl died in a dangerous challenge on the social media platform.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nltimes.nl/2021/06/02/dutch-foundation-targets-tiktok-eu14-billion-negligence-lawsuit\">https://nltimes.nl/2021/06/02/dutch-foundation-targets-tiktok-eu14-billion-negligence-lawsuit</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o6x9ya/dutch_foundation_targets_tiktok_in_14_billion_17/","title":"Dutch foundation targets TikTok in €1.4 billion ($1.7 billion) negligence lawsuit","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-24T13:32:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-24 13:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1398f530-b3dd-51cd-8876-78cbf41c872b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o6x9ya/dutch_foundation_targets_tiktok_in_14_billion_17/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o6x9ya/dutch_foundation_targets_tiktok_in_14_billion_17/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TaxShield","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TaxShield","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TaxShield","score":112,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"オランダの財団が14億ユーロ（約17億円）の過失訴訟でTikTokを標的に","the_new_excerpt":"オランダの財団、14億ユーロの過失訴訟でTikTokを標的に\n\nオランダの市場調査財団SOMIは水曜日、TikTokを相手取った訴訟を起こしました。\n水曜日に、数千人の親御さんを代表して、TikTok社を提訴しました。\nこの訴訟は、数千人の親御さんを代表して起こされたもので、親御さんたちは、ソーシャル・メディア・プラットフォームが子どもたちのプライバシーを確保する上で過失があったとし、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"荷兰基金会在14亿欧元（17亿美元）的过失诉讼中针对TikTok提起诉讼","the_new_excerpt":"荷兰基金会在14亿欧元的过失诉讼中针对TikTok提出诉讼\n\n荷兰市场研究基金会SOMI于周三代表数千名被骗者对TikTok提起诉讼。\n周三，代表数千名相关家长对TikTok提起诉讼，他们指责该社交媒体平台在确保其孩子的安全方面存在疏忽。\n他们指责社交媒体平台在确保他们孩子的隐私方面存在过失，并且...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"荷蘭基金會在14億歐元（17億美元）的過失訴訟中針對TikTok提起訴訟","the_new_excerpt":"荷蘭基金會在14億歐元的過失訴訟中針對TikTok提出訴訟\n\n荷蘭市場研究基金會SOMI於週三代表數千名被騙者對TikTok提起訴訟。\n週三，代表數千名相關家長對TikTok提起訴訟，他們指責該社交媒體平臺在確保其孩子的安全方面存在疏忽。\n他們指責社交媒體平臺在確保他們孩子的隱私方面存在過失，並且...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5507a94d-dcb6-5145-96a2-20ae57aa30cc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/o6t1bd/one_should_not_let_the_miracle_of_longterm/","title":"“One should not let the miracle of long-term compounding of returns be overwhelmed by the tyranny of long-term compounding of costs,” Bogle once said.","date":"June 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"長期複利によるリターンの奇跡が、長期複利によるコストの圧迫に負けてはならない」とボーグルはかつて語っています。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"人们不应该让长期复利回报的奇迹被长期复利成本的暴政所淹没，\"Bogle曾经说过。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"人們不應該讓長期複利回報的奇蹟被長期複利成本的暴政所淹沒，\"Bogle曾經說過。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c458fc48-d9b6-5db5-adf9-b65f97632462","excerpt":"DENVER & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE [https://www.businesswire.com/])--For retailers,\nfew challenges are as complex and critical as demand forecasting.
