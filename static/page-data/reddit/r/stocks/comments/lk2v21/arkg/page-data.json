I currently hold ten percent ARKK and wanted to put another 5 percent in another ARK fund and was hoping for ARKG. However when I go through the weightings of ARKG&#39;s holdings it seems they are a lot of small and medium cap companies. My worry is that ARK owns around ten percent of these companies and this is quite a risky play.</p>\n\n<p>Does ARKG manage too much money for them to achieve what they want to do in ARKG or is my logic flawed. I truly believe genomics is a great ten year strategy but is this fund too big to be nimble enough to navigate this volatile area? I notice recently they are buying into bigger pharma companies (Roche, Takeda, Nov) is this just to park cash or is there an actual genomics play here. A quick glance at their pipeline I couldn&#39;t find much.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for clearing this up as I&#39;m quite new to this.</p>\n\n<p>I also used <a href=\"https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php\">https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php</a> to find out the fund overlaps</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","title":"ARKG","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T08:38:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 08:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ea7509c8-a57c-5b37-8642-f4563cba293b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lk2v21/arkg/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Gucci_Bane_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gucci_Bane_","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Gucci_Bane_","score":84,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ARKG","the_new_excerpt":"ARKG权重\n\n嘿，我对这些ARK基金比较陌生。我目前持有10%的ARKK和\n想再投5%到另一只ARK基金，并希望能投ARKG。\n然而当我翻看ARKG的持股比重时，似乎他们是一\n很多中小市值的公司。我的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARKG","the_new_excerpt":"ARKG權重\n\n嘿，我對這些ARK基金比較陌生。我目前持有10%的ARKK和\n想再投5%到另一隻ARK基金，並希望能投ARKG。\n然而當我翻看ARKG的持股比重時，似乎他們是一\n很多中小市值的公司。我的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f7d2e9fd-2efa-5aa4-952c-1e3f3a31a6e6","excerpt":"So I was listening to an interview with Howard Marks & Joel Greenblatt, called\n\"Is It Different This Time?\" (google it if you haven't, its fantastic) and one\nof Joel's talking points about the euphoria we've reached in the stock markets\nis that:\n\n * He took the 100 least profitable companies in 2019…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lk688l/is_now_the_time_to_jump_ship_50_of_nysenasdaq/","title":"Is now the time to jump ship? 50% of NYSE/NASDAQ equities posted a TTM EPS <0","date":"February 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"现在是跳槽的时候了吗？50%的纽交所/纳斯达克股票公布的TTM每股收益<0元","the_new_excerpt":"所以我在听霍华德-马克斯和乔尔-格林布拉特的采访，叫什么？\n\"这次不一样吗？\" （谷歌它，如果你没有，它的奇妙）和一个\n乔尔的谈话要点，我们已经达到了股市的兴奋感\n是那。\n\n * 他把2019年最不赚钱的100家公司... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在是跳槽的時候了嗎？50%的紐交所/納斯達克股票公佈的TTM每股收益<0元","the_new_excerpt":"所以我在聽霍華德-馬克斯和喬爾-格林布拉特的採訪，叫什麼？\n\"這次不一樣嗎？\" （谷歌它，如果你沒有，它的奇妙）和一個\n喬爾的談話要點，我們已經達到了股市的興奮感\n是那。\n\n * 他把2019年最不賺錢的100家公司... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-52c69c64-1c25-5d7e-a2d2-13e558c38476","excerpt":"Started \"investing\" ~6 months back due to covid lockdowns and having nothing\nbetter to do, I have not invested prior to this.
