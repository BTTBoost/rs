WTF? Yes, but how is this possible and why are short interest websites not showing this yet? Read on to find out:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> OWLT just officially IPO&#39;ed last Friday after going public through a SP@C (formerly SBG) and so all the financial websites have not updated its short interest and/or total float yet. One of the unique things about a SP@C is that right before the official IPO or &quot;merger,&quot; a shareholder can trade in their shares for their net asset value of $10 instead of actually holding shares in the company. What’s been happening recently though is that large hedge funds buy up all the shares they can get at ~$9.98 right before merger and then trade them in for their $10 cash trust value for a guaranteed 0.2% profit. For every share that is traded in, the company will receive $10 lesson funding and there will also be one less share in the total float after the official IPO.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Short Position Is Taken:</strong> With SP@Cs getting smacked across the board recently, a profitable strategy has been to short shares prior to the official IPO since that is when the $10 floor is removed for a [SP@C](mailto:SP@C). Therefore, Hedge Fund ABC sees an opportunity in shorting OWLT in anticipation of it dropping in price after merger. So, they short as many shares (1.77 million) as they can.  More specifically, a large chunk of those shares were shorted at the end of June when the stock was at $10, which for the most part would only be done by a principle short planning to hold their short into deSP@C (merger). At the time, OWLT had 23 million shares total, so it wasn’t THAT high of a short interest ratio.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Total Available Shares Reduces by 86%:</strong> As mentioned in the background, there have been an increasing amount of SP@C shares bought by hedge funds and traded in to secure a 0.2% profit. So, Hedge Fund XYZ decides to do this with OWLT, which was trading at $9.97-9.98 for about a month before the official IPO date. Ultimately, they buy up an incredible 86% of the float trade them in for $10 before merger. Sure, Owlet now has 86% less of the cash in the SP@C trust  to make their life-saving baby products but oh well, hedge funds gotta get paid their 0.2% ya know? As a result, this removes 86% of the shares available from the total float, which means that the original 23 million float is reduced to only 3.24 million shares.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Putting It Together:</strong> With these two moves, OWLT now has a float of only 3.24 million shares with 1.77 million of those shares sold short based on the most recent data from the end of June. (Could there more or less shares shorted since that time? Yes, but I&#39;m guessing if anything short interest got even higher since almost every SP@C these past two weeks has been dropping like a fly after their official IPO debut, further confirming the hedge fund&#39;s short strategy.)</p>\n\n<p>With 1.77 million shares sold short, this would equate to a short interest ratio of 54.6%, which according to <a href=\"http://highshortinterest.com/\">highshortinterest.com</a> would make it by far the most shorted stock in the world with second place coming in at 39.14%. They don&#39;t have OWLT at the top of the list right now because financial websites have not updated the total available float as the company technically just went public on Friday (July 16).</p>\n\n<p>Given the information, I wouldn&#39;t want to be short the stock in a situation like this. I&#39;m betting that the people who are, are unaware of the situation and might get caught very off side. Being caught off side, in size, is a very tough spot to be in especially considering the low volume/float. It&#39;ll be interesting to see what happens in the coming days.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hedge Fund ABC shorts OWLT as much as they can (1.77 million shares) before the official IPO date and $10 floor is removed.</li>\n<li>Hedge Fund XYZ buys up as many of the shares as they can (86% of the float) and trades them in to make 0.2% profit, subsequently reducing the total available float by 86%.</li>\n<li>As a result, based on the latest data, OWLT now has a total float of only 3.24 million shares with 54.6% of those shares shorted. With this small of a float and high of short interest, Hedge Fund ABC&#39;s short position would be incredibly vulnerable if people start to catch on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Data backing this thesis:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/huRQv9P\">Bloomberg terminal screenshot showing total amount of shares shorted at 1.77M</a>. Note: the total float hasn&#39;t been updated yet, which is why % float short only says 7.68.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/SBG.htm\">Shortsqueeze.com also verifying short interest data for OWLT at 1.77M shares</a> (OWLT was formerly known as SBG back when it was a [SP@C](mailto:SP@C). OWLT&#39;s price is now $9.10)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001816708/000114036121024354/brhc10026886_8k.htm\">8-K filing</a> showing that 19.76 million shares were traded in or &quot;redeemed&quot; and therefore only 3.24 million shares remain: <em>&quot;A total of 19,758,773 shares of Class A common stock were presented for redemption in connection with the Special Meeting (the “Redemptions”). As a result, there will be approximately $32.4 million remaining in the trust account following redemptions.&quot;</em> (Note: originally, there were 23 million shares available for a total trust value of $230 million).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816708/000114036121004864/nt10020073x2_ex10-1.htm\">PIPE participants were not allowed to short, and their shares won&#39;t be registered and added to the float for many weeks. This indicates it was someone shorting OWLT to profit and not to box in their investment position</a>: <em>&quot;</em> <em>Term 10, subsection 10: n.</em> <em>The Investor hereby acknowledges and agrees that it will not, and will cause each person acting at the Investor’s direction or pursuant to any understanding with the Investor to not, directly or indirectly offer, sell, pledge, contract to sell or sell any option to purchase, or engage in hedging activities or execute any “short sales” as defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO under the Exchange Act in respect of, Sandbridge’s Class A common stock until the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (or such earlier termination of this Subscription Agreement in accordance with its terms).&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ola0rw/a_curious_situation_for_sbgs_owlt_float_after_86/\">This other post</a> does a great job of diving more into the details and data of how this unexpected situation came about, which helped a lot to inspire this post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Owlet:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;ve read this far, I might as well also share a bit about the company itself. From what I can tell, Owlet is actually a pretty good company. Here&#39;s their <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1004/3036/files/Owlet_SPAC_Presentation_Deck_Feb-2021_Final.pdf?v=1613532833\">investor presentation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From slide 24, you can see their smart sock and baby monitoring product has an NPS score of 76 and 68, which is very high, on par or higher than any Apple product. From slide 24, you can see that they are developing a whole platform of products beyond their smart sock and cam to help parents take care of their babies. On Glassdoor, they have a 4.6 rating and 100% CEO approval. Amazon product reviews are all 4.5+ stars with a Fakespot score of B. Nice.</p>\n\n<p>On slide 7, it shows their valuation was $1.39B at a price of $10. At its current price of $9.10 and reduced cash position as a result of the shares traded in, the valuation is now $1.1B. Considering that they are growing at ~50%, have expected 2022 revenues of $175M, gross margins of ~50%, it honestly doesn’t seem like a bad valuation to me.  Mainly though, I&#39;m in this play for the squeeze.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/on50xo/why_owlet_owlt_the_baby_camsock_company_has/","title":"Why Owlet (OWLT), the baby cam/sock company, has likely become the most shorted stock in the world at 54.6% SI without people even realizing","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-19T07:34:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-19 07:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5833e453-7e07-519d-a77f-7ae3feaf6d9a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/on50xo/why_owlet_owlt_the_baby_camsock_company_has/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/on50xo/why_owlet_owlt_the_baby_camsock_company_has/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Hardcoreposer7","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hardcoreposer7","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Hardcoreposer7","score":119,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ベビーカム・靴下のOwlet(OWLT)が、人々が気づかないうちに、54.6%のSIで世界で最もショートされている株になった理由","the_new_excerpt":"紹介します。Owlet (OWLT) は、親が赤ちゃんを安全に保ち、SIDS (乳幼児の主要な死亡原因) のリスクを大幅に軽減することを支援する企業です。\nSIDS（乳幼児の死亡原因の第1位）のリスクを大幅に低減させることができる企業です。\n世界で最も空売りされている銘柄になったようです。WTF? でも、どうしてこんなことが\nそして、なぜ空売りのウェブサイトはまだこれを表示していないのでしょうか...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么婴儿摄像头/袜子公司Owlet（OWLT）可能已经成为世界上被做空最多的股票，SI为54.6%，而人们甚至没有意识到这一点","the_new_excerpt":"介绍。Owlet (OWLT)是一家帮助父母保护婴儿安全并大大降低婴儿猝死症（SIDS）风险的公司。\n该公司帮助父母保护他们的婴儿安全，并大大减少SIDS（婴儿死亡的主要原因）的风险。\n可能成为世界上被做空最多的股票。WTF？是的，但是这怎么可能\n为什么做空网站还没有显示这个？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼嬰兒攝像頭/襪子公司Owlet（OWLT）可能已經成爲世界上被做空最多的股票，SI爲54.6%，而人們甚至沒有意識到這一點","the_new_excerpt":"介紹。Owlet (OWLT)是一家幫助父母保護嬰兒安全並大大降低嬰兒猝死症（SIDS）風險的公司。\n該公司幫助父母保護他們的嬰兒安全，並大大減少SIDS（嬰兒死亡的主要原因）的風險。\n可能成爲世界上被做空最多的股票。WTF？是的，但是這怎麼可能\n爲什麼做空網站還沒有顯示這個？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-962f3655-53de-5e92-8d13-4488fda2f617","excerpt":"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. has agreed to acquire Five9 Inc.\nfor $14.7 billion in stock, targeting a cloud service provider that could shore\nup its popular virtual meeting app.\n\nFive9 stockholders will receive 0.5533 shares of Zoom’s Class A common stock\nunder an agreement…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/on4ls3/zoom_to_buy_cloud_service_firm_five9_for_147/","title":"Zoom to Buy Cloud Service Firm Five9 for $14.7 Billion","date":"July 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ズーム、クラウドサービス企業Five9を147億ドルで買収","the_new_excerpt":"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc.は、Five9 Inc.を147億ドルで買収することに合意しました。\nを147億ドルで買収することに合意しました。これは、人気の仮想会議アプリを強化できるクラウドサービスプロバイダーをターゲットとしています。\n同社の人気仮想会議アプリを強化できるクラウドサービスプロバイダーを狙っている。\n\nFive9の株主は、合意に基づき、ズームのクラスA普通株式0.5533株を受け取る。\n合意に基づき...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"中联重科将以147亿美元收购云服务企业Five9","the_new_excerpt":"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc.已同意以147亿美元的股票收购Five9 Inc.\n以147亿美元的价格收购Five9公司，目标是建立一个可以支持其受欢迎的云服务提供商。\n其流行的虚拟会议应用程序。\n\nFive9的股东将获得0.5533股Zoom的A类普通股。\n根据一项协议...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中聯重科將以147億美元收購雲服務企業Five9","the_new_excerpt":"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc.已同意以147億美元的股票收購Five9 Inc.\n以147億美元的價格收購Five9公司，目標是建立一個可以支持其受歡迎的雲服務提供商。\n其流行的虛擬會議應用程序。\n\nFive9的股東將獲得0.5533股Zoom的A類普通股。\n根據一項協議...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-b01daa73-b0d6-5230-a5a5-939e99f9d330","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/on6y6x/gme_5100_1500_to_70k/","title":"GME - 5100% - $1500 to $70k","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 19, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME - 5100% - $1500～$70k","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"GME - 5100% - 15至7万美元","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME - 5100% - 15至7萬美元","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-5833e453-7e07-519d-a77f-7ae3feaf6d9a","previousId":"RedditPost-962f3655-53de-5e92-8d13-4488fda2f617","nextId":"RedditPost-b01daa73-b0d6-5230-a5a5-939e99f9d330","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/on50xo/why_owlet_owlt_the_baby_camsock_company_has/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
