I want to say that i believe in this firmly.</p>\n\n<p>just for curiosity i’ve seen this with the us stock market, and history states this is true. However i’ve checked different markets and this is not the case, for example with the Italian stock market (im italian) its still far below the 2008 crisis, similar the france, uk and japan stock market which are barely above their ath in the 90’s. And 20 years to be barely above is wasted time, imagining people start investing in their 20, at 40 they are still under or barely above.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is this statement only valid for the us stock market as its the leader in the world? As because for the italian stock market investors would still be below of a lot from ath (not only index but stocks also) </p>\n\n<p>My english is bad hope you understood my question.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q1j40v/bob_the_worst_investor_not_in_us_market/","title":"Bob the worst investor not in US market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-05T19:56:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-05 19:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q1j40v","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q1j40v/bob_the_worst_investor_not_in_us_market/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q1j40v/bob_the_worst_investor_not_in_us_market/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"fuma000","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/fuma000","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"fuma000","score":37,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ボブは米国市場ではない最悪の投資家","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、ここ数日、redditで以下のような投稿を目にしました。\n市場での時間が市場のタイミングに勝るという事実を強調しています。私はこれを\nこれをしっかりと信じています。\n\n興味本位でアメリカの株式市場について見てみましたが、歴史的に見ても\nこれは真実です。しかし、私がチェックしたのは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"鲍勃是不在美国市场的最差投资者","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，在过去的几天里，我在reddit上看到这个帖子，强调了\n市场中的时间胜过市场中的时机。我想说，我\n坚定地相信这一点。\n\n只是出于好奇，我在美国股市看到了这一点，而历史表明\n这是真的。然而，我已经检查了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"鮑勃是不在美國市場的最差投資者","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，在過去的幾天裏，我在reddit上看到這個帖子，強調了\n市場中的時間勝過市場中的時機。我想說，我\n堅定地相信這一點。\n\n只是出於好奇，我在美國股市看到了這一點，而歷史表明\n這是真的。然而，我已經檢查了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1445361769090846724","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1445361769090846724","title":"Bitcoin tops $50,000 while meme coin Shiba Inu gains 50% in 24 hours https://t.co/nqomrCiHOd","date":"October 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ビットコインは5万ドルを突破、ミームコインの柴犬は24時間で50％上昇 https://t.co/nqomrCiHOd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"比特币突破50,000美元，而纪念币Shiba Inu在24小时内上涨50% https://t.co/nqomrCiHOd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"比特幣突破50,000美元，而紀念幣Shiba Inu在24小時內上漲50% https://t.co/nqomrCiHOd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q21eqb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q21eqb/zucc_at_his_next_virtual_hearing/","title":"Zucc at his next virtual hearing","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 05, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"次のバーチャルヒアリングでのZucc","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Zucc在他的下一次虚拟听证会上","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Zucc在他的下一次虛擬聽證會上","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q1j40v","previousId":"TweetPost-1445361769090846724","nextId":"RedditPost-q21eqb","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q1j40v/bob_the_worst_investor_not_in_us_market/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
