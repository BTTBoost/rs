This is the biggest marketcap drop in one day. To put in perspective, if markets were flat, amazon alone would contribute 0.15% drop in VT (all equities worldwide) 0.3% in VOO (sp500) and 0.63% in QQQ The drop is enough, in theory, to send 1100 dollars to every us household. In terms of marketcap leaders, apple is 2.4 trillion, microsoft is 2.15 trillion, saudi aramco is at 1.85 trillion, google is 1.8 trillion, amazon is 1.67 trillion. google surpasses amazon in marketcap due to strong surge as earnings beat expectations by more than 40%. amazon missed revenue and guidance was below expectations. this is one of the few times amazon misses earnings, and one of the worst % drops for amazon not including 2000,2008 crash.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, this drop is exaggerated. most of the drop is because of sales dropping and bad guidance, but most of revenue comes from retail. But most of the profit comes from aws and ads, and both of the business has accelerated this year. Retail is low margin business, usually 2-3% whereas 20-30% for ads and aws. so aws and ads revenue is 10 times more valuable. People pay attention to revenue as a whole instead of the segments making the profits. I would consider to buy this stock but im more of an etf guy, so i dont have a position.</p>\n\n<p>sources: companiesmarketcap, vanguard/nasdaq site.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/out55s/amazon_drops_137_billion_in_marketcap_a_record/","title":"Amazon drops 137 billion in marketcap - a record.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-30T21:09:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-30 21:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"273bdded-0c70-541a-b807-04f7d467d232","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/out55s/amazon_drops_137_billion_in_marketcap_a_record/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/out55s/amazon_drops_137_billion_in_marketcap_a_record/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"doggy_lovers","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/doggy_lovers","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"doggy_lovers","score":3147,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アマゾン、時価総額1,370億円を記録。","the_new_excerpt":"アマゾンは決算後の今日、7.5％下落し、1日で137.25億円の損失を出しました。これは\nこれは、1日での最大のマーケットキャップの下落です。視点を変えれば、もし市場が横ばいなら\n視点を変えてみると、もし市場が横ばいであれば、アマゾンだけでVT(全世界の株式)の0.15%の下落に貢献する。\nVOO(sp500)では0.3%、QQQでは0.63% この下落は十分なもので、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"亚马逊的市值下降了1370亿--创下纪录。","the_new_excerpt":"亚马逊今天在财报后下跌7.5%，一天内损失1372.5亿。这\n这是一天内最大的市值跌幅。从这个角度来看，如果市场是平的\n平，仅亚马逊就会使VT（全球所有股票）下跌0.15%。\nVOO（SP500）的0.3%和QQQ的0.63%，这个跌幅已经足够了。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亞馬遜的市值下降了1370億--創下紀錄。","the_new_excerpt":"亞馬遜今天在財報後下跌7.5%，一天內損失1372.5億。這\n這是一天內最大的市值跌幅。從這個角度來看，如果市場是平的\n平，僅亞馬遜就會使VT（全球所有股票）下跌0.15%。\nVOO（SP500）的0.3%和QQQ的0.63%，這個跌幅已經足夠了。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d719acc1-411e-5314-a081-50d55180deab","excerpt":"In 2019, highest was $2.306B.\n\nIn 2020, highest was $307M.\n\nAnd now in 2021, we have hit a whopping $1,039.394B.\n\nFor a short definition of what a reverse repo is, it is a short-term agreement\nto purchase securities in order to sell them back at a slightly higher price.\nCurrently it seems banks have…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ourri0/daily_reverse_repo_hits_historic_high_over_1/","title":"Daily Reverse Repo Hits Historic High - Over 1 Trillion","date":"July 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"日刊リバースレポが歴史的な高値を記録-1兆円を超える","the_new_excerpt":"2019年、最高は2.306Bドル。\n\n2020年は最高が307Mドル。\n\nそして今回、2021年にはなんと1,039.394Bドルを記録しました。\n\nリバースレポとは何かを簡単に説明すると、短期的な契約です。\n有価証券を購入し、それを少しでも高い価格で売り戻すための短期契約です。\n現在、銀行は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"每日逆回购创历史新高--超过1万亿","the_new_excerpt":"2019年，最高为23.06亿美元。\n\n在2020年，最高的是3.07亿美元。\n\n而现在在2021年，我们已经达到了惊人的10.394亿美元。\n\n对于什么是逆回购的简短定义，它是一种短期协议\n购买证券，以便以稍高的价格将其卖回。\n目前，银行似乎已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"每日逆回購創歷史新高--超過1萬億","the_new_excerpt":"2019年，最高爲23.06億美元。\n\n在2020年，最高的是3.07億美元。\n\n而現在在2021年，我們已經達到了驚人的10.394億美元。\n\n對於什麼是逆回購的簡短定義，它是一種短期協議\n購買證券，以便以稍高的價格將其賣回。\n目前，銀行似乎已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-cd7ea2f2-697e-5c8d-aedf-e0ea8496a789","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ouej9c/good_read_by_former_vanguard_ceo_jack_brennan_has/","title":"Good read by former Vanguard CEO Jack Brennan.
