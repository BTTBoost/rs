As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.</p>\n\n<p>Sort by VOLUME</p>\n\n<p>$GME<br/>\n<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme</a><br/>\n29,097 contracts @ $800<br/>\n10,905 contracts @ $200<br/>\n10,418 contracts @ $150</p>\n\n<p>This is HUGE volume. If the stock closes at $150 it can cause a chain reaction.</p>\n\n<p>$BB<br/>\n<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb</a><br/>\n6,665 contracts @ $11<br/>\n2,483 contracts @ $12<br/>\n1,692 contracts @ $10.50</p>\n\n<p>$AMC<br/>\n<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?p=amc</a><br/>\n43,493 contracts @ $8 - WOW!<br/>\n27,299 contracts @ $9<br/>\n26,471 contracts @ $10</p>\n\n<p>They can&#39;t let the price above $8!</p>\n\n<p>$NOK<br/>\n<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok</a><br/>\n4,064 contracts $4<br/>\n3,417 contracts $4.50</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 1 @ 4:30PM:<br/>\n<strong>AMC closed at $8.01 AH $8.04</strong><br/>\n<strong>NOK closed at $3.92 AH $3.94</strong><br/>\n<strong>GME closed at $101.74 AH $100.55</strong><br/>\n<strong>BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03</strong></p>\n\n<p>Option holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don&#39;t have the shares already.</p>\n\n<p>This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).</p>\n\n<p>It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they&#39;ve expired. It&#39;s very common around earnings.</p>\n\n<p>There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.</p>\n\n<p>AMC has A LOT MORE: <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&amp;p=amc\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&amp;p=amc</a>Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there&#39;s a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.</p>\n\n<p>BB gang, so you&#39;re not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.</p>\n\n<p>NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That&#39;s a decent amount... So there&#39;s potential for momentum here too.</p>\n\n<p>Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).</p>\n\n<p>Everyone have a great weekend.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: this is for entertainment/informational purposes only. Do your own research. Not financial advice. Eat crayons.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: fucked formatting</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt421e/gme_bb_nok_amc_option_expiry_today_very_close_to/","title":"$GME, $BB, $NOK, $AMC Option Expiry Today - VERY CLOSE TO BEING HUGE","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-27T16:37:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-27 16:37","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1d1d5a16-7301-5b11-bc74-c1bfef354fc1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt421e/gme_bb_nok_amc_option_expiry_today_very_close_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt421e/gme_bb_nok_amc_option_expiry_today_very_close_to/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/1O1L_JB_3AH6D6LQ-sG0z4Xw3m5w9giImtFik6wLJs0.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a3493dedbabed68d15d63888f37945dedec7d2af","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"bosshax","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bosshax","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"bosshax","score":3454,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$GME, $BB, $NOK, $AMC期权今日到期---------------------即将成为大单","the_new_excerpt":"人们似乎并没有充分认识到有多少选择是非常接近的。\n在今天到期的钱。由于这些期权变得更有可能最终在。\n的钱，它会创造很多正反馈的动力。并非所有选项\n买家会行使它们，但很多人会。记住每一个1期权=...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$GME, $BB, $NOK, $AMC期權今日到期---------------------即將成爲大單","the_new_excerpt":"人們似乎並沒有充分認識到有多少選擇是非常接近的。\n在今天到期的錢。由於這些期權變得更有可能最終在。\n的錢，它會創造很多正反饋的動力。並非所有選項\n買家會行使它們，但很多人會。記住每一個1期權=...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ad65ca45-96a6-5698-8f7d-ad35f2c30f23","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltnnun/dont_get_psychd_out_hang_in_there/","title":"Don't get Psych'd out!
