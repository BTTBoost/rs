The demand is expected to jump to at least 50% percent over the next 20 years, as part of the trend of several industries requiring significant amounts of copper to function. This includes increased consumer use of electronics, higher uptake of electric vehicles, as well as the utilization of renewable energy resources.</p>\n\n<p>I am no expert because I am somewhat new to this, but those who invest in these stocks will benefit. This is why I want to take advantage of it and try to diversify my portfolio by investing in both senior and junior players.</p>\n\n<p>With senior players, the biggest would be BHP Group (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BHP/\">BHP</a>) is the biggest miner in the world right now. It is reported that they will be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bhp-considering-exiting-oil-gas-business-bloomberg-news-2021-07-20/\">exiting the oil and gas business</a> , but they still are the world’s leading producer of copper concentrate as well as zinc concentrate and thermal coal. They are currently operating several copper mines in Chile and in South Australia, and they are among the best copper stocks to invest in.</p>\n\n<p>Freeport McMoran (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FCX/\">FCX</a>) is also a great value stock, since it is also among the bigger players in copper mining. They are the world’s largest producer of molybdenum, and are also highly engaged with copper and gold mining. Their stocks <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/freeport-mcmoran-inc-stock-underperforms-wednesday-when-compared-to-competitors-01626296012-89a632772be8\">underperformed</a> last Wednesday but they still are a good stock to buy if you want to go with the long-term theme of buying into Freeport.</p>\n\n<p>Junior mining investing can be quite risky, but their potential returns are pretty great. It offers investors the exposure to risks and opportunities that are not associated with large-cap stocks, and have so much growth potential especially if their explorations and projects turn out with good results.</p>\n\n<p>Among junior players, I have been eyeing Solaris Resources (SLS.TO). They have made a lot of growth recently, and have announced<a href=\"https://www.mining.com/solaris-resources-reports-high-grade-intercepts-at-warintza-in-ecuador/\"> high-grade intercepts</a> in Warintza and released their <a href=\"https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/mining-topics/topic/drill-results.html\">recent drill results</a> in the area. They have everything checked out – from geophysics to mineralization. And with their recent progress in their <a href=\"https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/\">Warintza project </a>(since they are already actively drilling), did in fact find <a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/solaris-announces-significant-new-discovery-at-warintza-east-858033544.html\">a new discovery at Warintza East.</a></p>\n\n<p>With the increase in demand for copper stocks, these copper mining companies will strive to keep up with the demand. But after all, demand is great for all stocks. And ultimately, investors will experience a positive economic effect because of the increasing demand and prices of copper.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ory6sf/thoughts_on_senior_and_junior_copper_mining_stocks/","title":"Thoughts on senior and junior copper mining stocks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-26T14:57:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-26 14:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b5b72fea-6eb5-5cfe-9a4d-6b524d1ba165","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ory6sf/thoughts_on_senior_and_junior_copper_mining_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ory6sf/thoughts_on_senior_and_junior_copper_mining_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"debaggeddatasetsv9","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/debaggeddatasetsv9","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"debaggeddatasetsv9","score":319,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"銅鉱山のシニア・ジュニア銘柄について思うこと","the_new_excerpt":"銅の需要が加速している中、銅の鉱山会社は懸命に\n提供するために努力しています。銅の需要は、今後20年間で少なくとも50％以上に急増すると予想されています。\nこれは、いくつかの産業が機能するために大量の銅を必要としているというトレンドの一環です。\nこれは、いくつかの産業が機能するために大量の銅を必要とする傾向があるからです。これは、いくつかの産業が機能するために大量の銅を必要とするという傾向の一環です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对高级和初级铜矿股的看法","the_new_excerpt":"随着对铜需求的加速，铜矿公司正在努力提供\n努力提供。预计在未来20年内，需求将跃升至至少50%。\n未来20年，作为几个行业需要大量铜来运作的趋势的一部分。\n运作需要大量的铜。这包括增加...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對高級和初級銅礦股的看法","the_new_excerpt":"隨着對銅需求的加速，銅礦公司正在努力提供\n努力提供。預計在未來20年內，需求將躍升至至少50%。\n未來20年，作爲幾個行業需要大量銅來運作的趨勢的一部分。\n運作需要大量的銅。這包括增加...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bb29f1f3-3b0c-5f17-8864-4da6bc330ad9","excerpt":"While china is a risky market, I bought 20 share of CQQQ last week.
