Instead, you should look at the company&#39;s earnings and collect it like a landlord would their rents — with the expectation that the earnings will one day be greater than the amount you invested.</p>\n\n<p>The second post details how companies with moats make more money than other companies and hence why they&#39;re better investments. I shared a simple, three-step process to identify companies with moats and stressed the correlation between companies with strong moats and <strong>Owner&#39;s earnings,</strong> a metric Warren Buffett created and uses to value companies himself. Unfortunately, Owner&#39;s earnings is not a standardized metric and is not provided in the financial statements. It can however be calculated.</p>\n\n<p>Many of you responded with very encouraging and kinds words. Thank you❤️. In that same vein, I made a spreadsheet based on these concepts that can and hopefully will help you and retail investors alike become better long-term value investors.</p>\n\n<p><em>For those of you unfamiliar with</em> <a href=\"https://stablebread.com/how-to-calculate-and-analyze-warren-buffetts-owners-earnings/\"><em>Owner&#39;s earnings</em></a><em>, I will be making a post on this shortly for those of you who wanted me to delve into it more. For now, just know that it represents how much cash falls into the business owner’s pockets. Basically it is the amount of cash you’re left with after you spend on whatever you need to to maintain, but not grow, the business and is a more realistic and accurate portrayal of a company&#39;s intrinsic value than EPS, Operating Cash or FCF.</em></p>\n\n<h2>What does this spreadsheet do?</h2>\n\n<p>This spreadsheet puts you in the position of a <strong>business owner</strong>, who collects the earnings of their companies on a regular basis. When you own a share you own a part of the business and therefore receive a part of its profits. It does so by automatically tracking and accumulating your <strong>Owner’s earnings</strong> your shares. All you got to do is input your transactions — ticker symbol, date purchased, number of shares purchased, and share price.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of showing you your total portfolio value or day-to-day share price, which is not only irrelevant to long-term investing (mostly), but also suboptimal insofar as it can evoke volatile emotions and trigger poor decisions, this spreadsheet chiefly displays the Owner’s earnings of the businesses and shares you own.</p>\n\n<h2>How will it make you a better long-term investor?</h2>\n\n<p>This spreadsheet and the formula behind it have been meticulously designed to make you a better long-term investor. The formula is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Your earnings = Owner&#39;s earnings per share * number of shares you own * days held/period \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To maximize your earnings, you must maximize each of its components. In doing so, you will have achieved the holy grail of long-term value investing:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Invest in great companies with wide moats</strong></p>\n\n<p>To maximize owner’s earnings you must invest in great companies with wide moats that can and will grow their earnings at a high rate for many years into the future. You don&#39;t want a company whose earnings stay the same year after year, you want a company that can grow as fast as possible for as long as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Buy stocks at a discount instead of panicking when it falls</strong></p>\n\n<p>To maximize the number of shares you own you must hunt for value and bargains. You have a limited amount of money to invest so you naturally want to buy as many shares (or earnings) as you can with that money. If two similar companies make $10 a year, one of them selling for $50 a share and the other $25 a share, you&#39;re going to go for the one selling for $25 (assuming equal growth rates) because you can buy $20 worth of earnings for the same amount of money. In other words, you want to grow your earnings as efficiently as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Hold on to companies for the long run and compound your money</strong></p>\n\n<p>To maximize days held you must hold onto your shares for as long as possible. The logic behind this is simple: Each day you hold on to a stock, the more money you make. If you hold a stock for a year, you make 100% of its owner’s earnings for that year for every share you owned. If you own it for 6 months you get 50% of its earnings. The longer you hold onto a stock, the more earnings you accumulate, and the more your money compounds.</p>\n\n<h2>Bottom line</h2>\n\n<p>This spreadsheet is an improved, more automatic, and intuitive adaption from a solution I&#39;ve been using myself and it&#39;s helped me become a more calm, collected, rational investor. Without it I would not have had as much fun finding great companies with strong earnings potential, nor would I have held onto them for as long as I have. In other words, it has made me a much more successful long-term investor and I hope it can do the same for you.</p>\n\n<p>Heres a copy of the spreadsheet: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dkoTDNG_JWeYP-_GJNW8f_MVXfDbSWyZPlfTRo28OUM/edit#gid=2052305304\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dkoTDNG_JWeYP-_GJNW8f_MVXfDbSWyZPlfTRo28OUM/edit#gid=2052305304</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Looking forward to your feedback, comments, criticisms</em> 🙂</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pdasq5/i_made_a_spreadsheet_to_help_myself_a_better/","title":"I made a spreadsheet to help myself a better long-term investor","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-28T16:01:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-28 16:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ae5d9fb9-2693-5d67-8c3e-c9b4443eab7d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pdasq5/i_made_a_spreadsheet_to_help_myself_a_better/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pdasq5/i_made_a_spreadsheet_to_help_myself_a_better/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"No_Try_5797","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Try_5797","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"No_Try_5797","score":773,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"より良い長期投資家になるためにスプレッドシートを作ってみた","the_new_excerpt":"tldr; オーナーの収入を自動的に追跡・集計するスプレッドシートを作りました。\nスプレッドシートを作りました。\n\n1週間ほど前に、「投資の最大の誤解」という2つの記事を書きました。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p62wp3/the_biggest_misconception_about_investing/] & 企業\nこの記事では、投資の最大の誤解 [] と企業についての記事を書きました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我做了一个电子表格，帮助自己成为更好的长期投资者","the_new_excerpt":"tldr; 我做了一个电子表格，可以自动跟踪和增加所有者的\n赚的钱。\n\n大约一周前，我发表了两篇文章，名为《投资的最大误区》。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p62wp3/the_biggest_misconception_about_investing/]和公司\n赚得比别人多，活得比别人长，而且......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我做了一個電子表格，幫助自己成爲更好的長期投資者","the_new_excerpt":"tldr; 我做了一個電子表格，可以自動跟蹤和增加所有者的\n賺的錢。\n\n大約一週前，我發表了兩篇文章，名爲《投資的最大誤區》。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p62wp3/the_biggest_misconception_about_investing/]和公司\n賺得比別人多，活得比別人長，而且......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-4c4f4c56-1440-5dd1-bf14-78a6a62d537c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pd71e1/my_calls_be_like/","title":"my calls be like…","date":"August 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の電話はまるで...。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的电话就像...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的電話就像...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-aed213ba-4366-5a71-8202-34485493dd41","excerpt":"I heard China is planning to ban new IPO's of Chinese companies on the US stock\nmarket.
