(“Coinbase”) (Nasdaq: COIN) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Coinbase also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Coinbase, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at Coinbase’s election.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A little surprising to me given the recent IPO and the fact that they trade below ipo reference price ($250, current close is 248.24, ~3% additional drop after market on these news). I still feel investment in $COIN presents an interesting way to expose oneself to crypto without actually holding crypto (and the whole “sell the pickaxes in the gold rush”). At the same time I’m guessing pressure is mounting and their fat margins might not be staying there for long so they will need to try to scale as much as possible.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/nercxl/coinbase_announced_a_125b_private_offering/","title":"Coinbase announced a $1.25B private offering","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-18T05:48:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-18 05:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f3e05722-b54f-51c8-82cc-c18cb355a4ff","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nercxl/coinbase_announced_a_125b_private_offering/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nercxl/coinbase_announced_a_125b_private_offering/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ivalm","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ivalm","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ivalm","score":74,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"コインベースが1.25Bドルのプライベート・オファーを発表","the_new_excerpt":"記事を見る\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005881/en/Coinbase-Announces-Proposed-Private-Offering-of-1.25-Billion-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Due-2026/\n\n> Coinbase Global, Inc.
