If youre sick of getting Motley Fooled give this a crack</p>\n\n<p>This is how I DD a stock, so hopefully, new investors won&#39;t get fooled into pump-and-dumps. There&#39;s obviously a lot of ways to do your due diligence on a stock, I think the most important thing is having a process and not relying on trash articles, or your mates tips :|</p>\n\n<p>My Stock DD Checklist Summary</p>\n\n<p>Are you sick of getting <em>Fooled</em> into terrible stocks? Stock DD or Due Diligence is probs the most important step in investing. So do your DD and don&#39;t COP a Pump and Dump.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step One: Identify the Stonk</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first step to a stock DD is obviously finding a stonk to DD. This could be a recommendation from your dodgy mate, or maybe you got Motley <em>Fooled</em> <em>.</em> The important thing to note here is the intent of the source that is mentioning the stock. Do they have a vested interest? Are they tryna pull a Jordan Belford on ya? What is their motive behind mentioning the stock?</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, it may be a good idea to identify your own stock. Have a think about companies that you interact with and see if they are publicly traded. Or browse through the listings. Although these strategies are honestly slow and probs trash you can be sure there’s no altera motive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Two: Understand the Company. Know the Stonk</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is an extension on the phrase don’t invest in something you don’t understand. The same goes for individual stocks, it’s probably not a good idea to invest in a company if you don’t even know what they do PROBABLY?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Search the Businesses ‘About Us’ Section</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Pretty much all listed companies will have a webpage with an ‘about us’ section browsing this and their website can be a good starting point to understanding their business, and a good start to a stock DD. See if their website is trash while ur there.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use Simply wall st and Read the Company Profile</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SWS is decent for listed stocks, it has a Company Overview section for every stock which gives a quick synopsis (Synopsis: a bRiEf suMmaRy oR gEneRal SurVEy Of SoMEThinG) about the business and what they do.</p>\n\n<p>How Much Do I Need To know?</p>\n\n<p>Peter Lynch “Never invest in an idea you can’t illustrate with a crayon.” As a starting point you should be able to answer at least these four questions, and probs be able to use a crayon;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What sector is the company in?</li>\n<li>What does the company do?</li>\n<li>How does the company make money?</li>\n<li>How long has the company been around?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Step Three: What is their Market Cap</strong></p>\n\n<p>A company’s market capitalization or (Market Cap: if you didn&#39;t know) is how much the stock market determines a company is worth. it is calculated by the total market value of all outstanding shares. These are Large, mid and small cap.</p>\n\n<p>Each category can be a good investment strategy it&#39;s just important to note that each group has different companies at varying levels of maturity. You shouldn&#39;t buy a micro-cap and be surprised if it gets delisted instead of paying dividends. Likewise, you probably shouldn&#39;t buy a Bluechip and hope they go to the moon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Four: Screening Software for Stock Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of websites and tools available to screen the selected stocks, Here&#39;s what i use:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trading View</strong> great</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yahoo Finance</strong> ehhh</p>\n\n<p><strong>Simply Wall St</strong> decent, (lots of nice Pics if u cant read)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are we looking for?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After picking some of these tools that works well for you, perform a basic fundamental analysis on the stock. Looking for any red flags:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS):</strong> Positive? Growing over time? Earning?????</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price to Earnings Ratio (PE):</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>PE 0/NA: <em>The company has no earnings</em></li>\n<li>PE 1-14: <em>The company is undervalued/has low investor sentiment regarding growth</em></li>\n<li>PE 15-20: <em>Average</em></li>\n<li>PE 20+: <em>The company is overvalued/has high investor sentiment regarding growth</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Book Value/share:</strong> The book value is the net assets of a business divided by the number of shares on issue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Debt:</strong> A company should have more assets than liabilities to avoid bankruptcy. We like companies with low-to-no debt. If a company has debt, ensure it is well covered by assets and earnings</p>\n\n<p><strong>Return on Equity (ROE):</strong></p>\n\n<p>Higher ROE = The better the company are at making money from equity and vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>We like companies with consistently higher ROE over 10. A low ROE means low growth potential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Past Performance:</strong> We all know &#39;past performance is not indicative of future returns&#39; but it can pay to have a quick look at the stock chart. If its going up that means money</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Five: Financials</strong></p>\n\n<p>find the companies latest Yearly or Half-Yearly report. Analyse its Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash flow statement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Six: Cap Raise! Dilution</strong></p>\n\n<p>Therse nothing more frustrating than seeing your share getting hit with Cap Raise after Cap Raise and seeing your shares diluted to nothing. We all had that feeling when they halt and release another supplementary prospectus. FML. One easy sign that a company is constantly raising capital is through looking at it&#39;s share price and number of shares on issue. IF SP is rly low and number of shares is rly high then they&#39;re probs cap raising 24/7.</p>\n\n<p>We can also use the financials we read before to try and predict if the company is adequately capitalised.</p>\n\n<p>A capital raise is not necessarily a red flag, but be wary and sucks to see all those trading haults.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Seven: Buy Sell Ratios and Volume</strong></p>\n\n<p>See if there are a healthy number of buyers and sellers and decent trading volumes. The best way to do this is using your trading platforms. If you&#39;re wanting to sell there&#39;s got to be someone to buy the trash off you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Eight: Prospects</strong></p>\n\n<p>When examining a company for your stock DD we should consider its macro and microeconomic factors. Notably regulation and future industry outlook and disruption. Are they gonna be the NExt Blockbuster? Is the gov gonna screw u over?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Nine: Competition</strong></p>\n\n<p>compare the stock to it&#39;s direct competitors. To do this we are going to go back to step four and compare the company&#39;s fundamentals against its competitors. If the competitors are better then why not buy them instead?</p>\n\n<p>Do they have an economic moat?</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>There are five types of generally accepted economic moat</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><em>;</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>Low-cost production;</em></strong>  <em>Companies that can keep their prices low can maintain market share and discourage competition</em></li>\n<li><strong><em>High switching costs;</em></strong> <em>Customers and suppliers might be less likely to change companies or providers if the move will incur monetary costs, time delays, or extra effort. e.g. banks and power providers</em></li>\n<li><strong><em>Network effects;</em></strong>  <em>network effect happens when the “value of a good or service grows” as its used by existing and new customers e.g. Amazon is an excellent example</em></li>\n<li><strong><em>Intangible assets;</em></strong> <em>Brand identity, patents, and government licenses are examples of intangible assets. e.g. think Nike or Coca-Cola as an excellent brand and think of the government regulation surrounding gamble and the moat this creates for gambling companies.</em></li>\n<li><strong><em>Efficient scale.</em></strong> <em>Companies that have a natural monopoly – or operate in markets or industries where there are few rivals</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>One thing to consider about an economic moat is they’re largely priced into a stock share price as they often relate to profits. For example Coca-Cola has an excellent brand and due to that sells more products and creates more profits. As such these factors will often be indirectly accounted for in Quantitate Analysis but it can be helpful to identify businesses with and without these moats.</em></p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Ten: Insider Ownership and Management</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Insider Ownership:</strong> We generally like companies with large insider ownership. This is big for small cap companies. Skin in the game helps ensure the management&#39;s motives are in line with ours. U can use Simple wall St (Swear i dont work witt them, just like their stuff) which shows Insider Ownership and Trading easily. We like small cap stocks with ~30% insider ownership and history of owners buying on market. For large cap companies&#39; insider ownership will be lower, 3-5% would be decent in this case. It wont be much for large caps u clearly wont see Bill G coppin 30% of Micros any time soon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are management buying or selling large amounts of shares?</strong> Sudden large selling by management for no apparent reason may hint that management believes the company is overvalued or peaked at that point in time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Management Experience:</strong> Consider educational and professional backgrounds. One of the most important factors is their experience in the industry. Their reputation is also key. What goals has the management set out for the company? Have the leaders had successful projects in the past, or did they fail?</p>\n\n<p>One case study of management is the affect that Elon Musk has had on tesla.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Step: Speccies are Sentiment and Hype</strong></p>\n\n<p>After going through every step and doing a thorough DD, it&#39;s important to mention that the market is unpredictable trash. Even with the most advanced analyses, speccies are just sentiment and hype. By every stretch of fundamental analysis, they are trash stonks, that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make money off them. Just be ready for the pump-and-dump!</p>\n\n<p>(reposted w/ a bit more info. Also had to remove all the links to the SWS and trading and stuff bc the subreredit didnt like. I got nothign to do with them. I just like their stuff)</p>\n\n<p>Cheers for reading blokes. Hoepfully this saves at least someone from getting Motely Fooled into trash</p>\n\n<p>🚀 🚀 TLDR🚀🚀\nMotley fool is Trash.Maybe know the name of a company before YOLOing your life saving into it....
