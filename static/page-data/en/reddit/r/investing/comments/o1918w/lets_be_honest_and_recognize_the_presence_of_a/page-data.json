They live in this populist made-up reality where the world owes them something because they are oppressed and they are convinced that they predicted a global financial collapse when in reality they are just being played by market makers and heavily indebted companies that are trying to save themselves raising capital by issuing new shares. </p>\n\n<p>Then there&#39;s the crypto blokes, that know blockchain so well they probably never actually used it. They can&#39;t even recognize that all these coins including the big ones have almost zero use cases. You think these tokens are really going to become money, even with scalability problems that have remained unsolved for decades and a market that is easily maniuplated by falsely backed stablecoins issuers and a few exchanges? Do you actually believe these  charlatans  when no serious economist has ever said anything good about it?</p>\n\n<p>Even the guys and gals that are supposed to teach the average user personal finance just follow this mantra of buying and holding NASDAQ ETFs like they&#39;re the holy grail of investing, even if we are almost at an historic all time high in terms of valuations, even if everybody has forgotten that stocks are risky: I would like to see these people deal with crashes like 2000, 2009  or even with something similar to Japan. But of course, intrinsic value doesn&#39;t matter, right? Trying to value a stock like a bond is for boomers, we&#39;ll have endless growth. Let&#39;s price in the next centuries of earnings into every EV company.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly have to think that there is a good part of people that don&#39;t actually believe the narrative and just goes along with it to speculate and sell his bags to a more naive investor. That&#39;s why everyone, -and I say EVERYONE <strong>including institutions</strong>- scouts this website everyday just to find out what the next meme is going to be. &quot;What&#39;s the next worthless thing retail&#39;s going to pump this week? Just so I can get quickly in and out before it collapses&quot; ... since it&#39;s backed by zero fundamentals. It&#39;s a toxic and disgusting and opportunistic behaviour and it&#39;s a clear symptom of the presence of specuative fever in the markets. I&#39;m not saying everything&#39;s necessairly a bubble, because prices could keep going up for years. But you have to recognize that animal spirits are through the roof. I can condone it, but at least I acknowledge it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o1918w/lets_be_honest_and_recognize_the_presence_of_a/","title":"Let's be honest and recognize the presence of a toxic mania in today's markets, and that it's all just speculation.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-16T17:53:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-16 17:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e1d58bee-1fab-5fc3-a69f-be29af14ee0b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o1918w/lets_be_honest_and_recognize_the_presence_of_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o1918w/lets_be_honest_and_recognize_the_presence_of_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"xmrptbx","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/xmrptbx","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"xmrptbx","score":1512,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"正直に言って、今日の市場には有害なマニアが存在し、すべては投機に過ぎないことを認識しましょう。","the_new_excerpt":"reddit、twitter、youtubeなど、あらゆるソーシャルメディアで見ることができます。\n\nトレーディングを始めて数ヶ月の人でも、iPS細胞の読み方を知らない人もいます。\n財務諸表の読み方も知らず、時価総額とは何かも知らないような人が、突然、自分を専門家と称して\n数ヶ月間の取引で、損益計算書の読み方や、時価総額が何であるかも知らない人が、突然専門家として売り込み、自分が信じていることを素直に実行する...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"让我们诚实地认识到今天的市场存在着一种有毒的狂热，而且这一切都只是投机。","the_new_excerpt":"你可以在reddit、twitter、youtube和任何其他社交媒体上看到它。\n\n有的人已经做了几个月的交易，但甚至不知道\n忽然把自己卖成了专家，并做了他们认为很复杂的事情。\n忽然把自己卖成专家，做他们认为很复杂的事情......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"讓我們誠實地認識到今天的市場存在着一種有毒的狂熱，而且這一切都只是投機。","the_new_excerpt":"你可以在reddit、twitter、youtube和任何其他社交媒體上看到它。\n\n有的人已經做了幾個月的交易，但甚至不知道\n忽然把自己賣成了專家，並做了他們認爲很複雜的事情。\n忽然把自己賣成專家，做他們認爲很複雜的事情......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ecafdde1-bbed-5b78-bff9-c3ec89934787","excerpt":"Let me start by saying I've invested nearly $6MM in what I believe to be a\ngenerational investment opportunity brought about by significant cost disruption\nin satellite launch costs, innovations in marrying satellite technology to\nlow-earth orbit (\"LEO\") applications, and advances in LTE network…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1583q/asts_the_spacex_for_mobile_phones_6mm_yolo_with/","title":"$ASTS - The SpaceX for Mobile Phones - $6MM YOLO with Real DD","date":"June 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$ASTS - 携帯電話のためのSpaceX - 6MMドルのYOLOを実際のDDで実現。","the_new_excerpt":"まずは、私が世代を超えた投資機会だと信じているものに、約600万ドルを投資していることからお話します。\n衛星打ち上げコストの大幅な削減と、衛星技術との融合による\n衛星打ち上げコストの大幅な削減、衛星技術と低地球軌道（LEO）アプリケーションとの融合におけるイノベーション、LTEネットワークの進歩によってもたらされる、世代を超えた投資機会だと考え、約600万ドルを投資しました。\nこれは、衛星打ち上げコストの大幅な削減、衛星技術と低軌道（LEO）アプリケーションとの連携の革新、LTEネットワークの進化によってもたらされる、世代を超えた投資機会だと考えています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"ASTS美元--手机的SpaceX--6百万美元的YOLO与真实的DD","the_new_excerpt":"让我先说一下，我已经投资了近600万美元，我相信这是一个由显著的成本颠覆带来的代际投资机会。\n我相信这是一个由卫星发射成本的重大破坏所带来的一代投资机会。\n卫星发射成本的重大颠覆，将卫星技术与低地球轨道（\"LEO\"）应用相结合的创新，以及LTE网络的进步所带来的\n低地球轨道（\"LEO\"）应用的创新，以及LTE网络的进步所带来的一代投资机会......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ASTS美元--手機的SpaceX--6百萬美元的YOLO與真實的DD","the_new_excerpt":"讓我先說一下，我已經投資了近600萬美元，我相信這是一個由顯著的成本顛覆帶來的代際投資機會。\n我相信這是一個由衛星發射成本的重大破壞所帶來的一代投資機會。\n衛星發射成本的重大顛覆，將衛星技術與低地球軌道（\"LEO\"）應用相結合的創新，以及LTE網絡的進步所帶來的\n低地球軌道（\"LEO\"）應用的創新，以及LTE網絡的進步所帶來的一代投資機會......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-9bdfa2ac-375a-5171-aac7-2b365c0d59f0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o13b6v/firstever_congressional_bill_to_decriminalize_all/","title":"First-Ever Congressional Bill To Decriminalize All Drugs Announced Ahead Of Nixon Drug War Anniversary","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 16, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ニクソン大統領の麻薬戦争記念日を前に、米国議会初の全薬物非犯罪化法案を発表","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"有史以来第一个将所有毒品非刑罪化的国会法案在尼克松毒品战争纪念日之前宣布。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"有史以來第一個將所有毒品非刑罪化的國會法案在尼克松毒品戰爭紀念日之前宣佈。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-e1d58bee-1fab-5fc3-a69f-be29af14ee0b","previousId":"RedditPost-ecafdde1-bbed-5b78-bff9-c3ec89934787","nextId":"RedditPost-9bdfa2ac-375a-5171-aac7-2b365c0d59f0","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o1918w/lets_be_honest_and_recognize_the_presence_of_a/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
