Briefly here is what I discovered:</p>\n\n<p>-People are out!  The malls were busy and people seemed happy to be out in the mall again.  </p>\n\n<p>-About 15% went maskless, but still 85% still chose to wear masks even though not required</p>\n\n<p>-While the malls were busy, I wouldn&#39;t consider sales to be at a high level.  Most people were eating, walking, enjoying the time out.  But as I observed from different angles (throughout the mall, cashier lines, exits of mall) most shoppers did not have or leave with shopping bags.  </p>\n\n<p>-When asked (I spoke with 14 different shoppers) nearly 80% said they felt cautiously optimistic for the economy going forward.</p>\n\n<p>-There were two positive exceptions, one major and one minor.</p>\n\n<p>Minor exception: Nordstrom.  They had some lines, more customers than other stores and active buying throughout.  </p>\n\n<p>Major exception: Luxury goods.  Gucci, Coach, and the rest all seemed busy but above all else, the king of all was Louis Vuitton, consistently had a packed store with lines down the mall waiting to get in.  </p>\n\n<p>-Nike shut it&#39;s stores for Juneteenth which unfortunately for them was a prime Saturday shopping day.</p>\n\n<p>-One surprising active location was Dave and Busters.  I was drawn in by the noise and surprised to see so many young people in there.  It&#39;s become the modern arcade and it was packed with game players.</p>\n\n<p>-Nearly every single retail outlet had a &quot;Now Hiring&quot; sign.  Truly an amazing sight to see how demand workers are right now.  </p>\n\n<p>And finally, major competitors Annie Anne&#39;s and Wetzel&#39;s Pretzels are both doing well but poor Annie is not winning this fight as of now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o5fy0g/i_spent_time_in_two_of_the_largest_bay_area_malls/","title":"I spent time in two of the largest Bay Area malls to find out how the economy and retail companies are doing in the real world.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-22T11:53:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-22 11:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dc852085-a027-58b4-9c79-13ac2a1d1623","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o5fy0g/i_spent_time_in_two_of_the_largest_bay_area_malls/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o5fy0g/i_spent_time_in_two_of_the_largest_bay_area_malls/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"LegendLarrynumero1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LegendLarrynumero1","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"LegendLarrynumero1","score":135,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私は、経済や小売企業の実情を知るために、ベイエリア最大の2つのショッピングモールに滞在しました。","the_new_excerpt":"この2日間、私はシリコンバレーにある2つの大きなショッピングモールを視察しました。\nお店の人や従業員に話を聞き、環境を観察していました。手短に言うと\n私が発見したのは以下の通りです。\n\n-人が出ている！」。人が出ている！モールは賑わっていて、人々は再びモールに出られて嬉しそうだった。\nしていました。\n\n-約15％がマスクレスになり、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我在湾区最大的两个商场呆了一段时间，以了解经济和零售公司在现实世界中的表现。","the_new_excerpt":"在过去的两天里，我在硅谷最大的两个商场里考察了它们\n与购物者和员工交谈，并观察环境。简而言之\n是我所发现的。\n\n-人们都出来了! 商场很繁忙，人们似乎很高兴能再次来到商场。\n商场很热闹，人们似乎很高兴再次出来购物。\n\n-约有15%的人没有戴面具，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我在灣區最大的兩個商場呆了一段時間，以瞭解經濟和零售公司在現實世界中的表現。","the_new_excerpt":"在過去的兩天裏，我在硅谷最大的兩個商場裏考察了它們\n與購物者和員工交談，並觀察環境。簡而言之\n是我所發現的。\n\n-人們都出來了! 商場很繁忙，人們似乎很高興能再次來到商場。\n商場很熱鬧，人們似乎很高興再次出來購物。\n\n-約有15%的人沒有戴面具，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8b681fc0-7a82-557e-8bc9-2aaf5ff70d85","excerpt":"A London-based hedge fund that bet against GameStop is shutting down following\ndouble-digit percentage losses suffered during the first meme stock rally in\nJanuary, according to a report published Tuesday by the the Financial Times\nciting people familiar with the fund.\n\nWhite Square Capital, which…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5f72j/hedge_fund_that_bet_against_gamestop_is_closing/","title":"Hedge fund that bet against GameStop is closing down","date":"June 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GameStop社に賭けたヘッジファンドが閉鎖へ","the_new_excerpt":"GameStop社に賭けていたロンドンのヘッジファンドが閉鎖されました。\n1月に行われた最初のミームストックラリーで2桁の損失を出したため、GameStopに賭けていたロンドンのヘッジファンドが閉鎖されました。\nロンドンに拠点を置くヘッジファンドが、GameStopに賭けていました。\nこれは、同ファンドの関係者を引用して、Financial Timesが火曜日に発表した報道によるものです。\n\nホワイト・スクエア・キャピタルは、ゲームストップに賭けていたヘッジファンドです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对赌GameStop的对冲基金正在倒闭","the_new_excerpt":"一家押注GameStop的伦敦对冲基金正在关闭，因为\n根据《金融时报》周二发表的报道，在1月份的第一次记忆股涨势中遭受两位数的损失后，该基金正在关闭。\n据《金融时报》周二发表的一份报告称\n援引熟悉该基金的人士的报道。\n\n白方资本，它...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對賭GameStop的對沖基金正在倒閉","the_new_excerpt":"一家押注GameStop的倫敦對沖基金正在關閉，因爲\n根據《金融時報》週二發表的報道，在1月份的第一次記憶股漲勢中遭受兩位數的損失後，該基金正在關閉。\n據《金融時報》週二發表的一份報告稱\n援引熟悉該基金的人士的報道。\n\n白方資本，它...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-3aea5cf7-12e4-5eb2-966b-eb5a143cfffc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5k4w3/gamestop_completes_atthemarket_equity_offering/","title":"GameStop Completes At-The-Market Equity Offering Program","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 22, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GameStop社、市場での株式公開プログラムを完了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"GameStop完成了市场上的股票发行计划","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GameStop完成了市場上的股票發行計劃","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-dc852085-a027-58b4-9c79-13ac2a1d1623","previousId":"RedditPost-8b681fc0-7a82-557e-8bc9-2aaf5ff70d85","nextId":"RedditPost-3aea5cf7-12e4-5eb2-966b-eb5a143cfffc","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o5fy0g/i_spent_time_in_two_of_the_largest_bay_area_malls/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
