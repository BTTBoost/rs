&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry is set to have a parabolic run over the next few weeks/months with many upcoming catalysts! Below is my analysis of why I think the stock is going higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying BlackBerry now is similar to buying $AMD at $2.00 in 2014 when SU BAE stepped in as CEO and took the stock to the moon! I believe this is a very similar opportunity right now! 🤫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My fellow APES&lt;/strong&gt; 🐵 &lt;strong&gt;just remember that DIAMONDS&lt;/strong&gt; 💎 &lt;strong&gt;are made under PRESSURE&lt;/strong&gt; 🖐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Luck and let&amp;#39;s hope that PAPA CHEN makes it rain TENDIES!  🐔 💦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background - The turn around story of the SLEEPING GIANT&lt;/strong&gt;  💪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of CEO John Chen, BlackBerry has spent the past 8 years pivoting from hardware smartphones to the future: (1) IoT Internet of Things (2) Automotive/EV and (3) Cyber Security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of these areas are growth opportunities and BlackBerry has strategically partnered with many large tech companies including: Amazon, Microsoft and Qualcomm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market value of &lt;strong&gt;BlackBerry is CRIMINALLY UNDERVALUED&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;at ~$6 Billion&lt;/strong&gt; compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $53 Billion, $PANW at $54 Billion and $ZS at $48 Billion to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transformation of the business can be summarized in the slide below. Mickensy Consulting has estimated that the pool of reoccurring revenue from the IoT and connected car will grow exponentially over the next 10 years, which is VERY GOOD for BlackBerry&amp;#39;s new business model!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t037ypmu9m181.png?width=1706&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=977b898dae2d197779b042a40b56702310ae3ad9&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t037ypmu9m181.png?width=1706&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=977b898dae2d197779b042a40b56702310ae3ad9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n0ietxa1bm181.png?width=1246&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01c9ae993ec8935af6e04c22163b46fd9dae1aae&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n0ietxa1bm181.png?width=1246&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01c9ae993ec8935af6e04c22163b46fd9dae1aae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patent Sale/Settlement/Partnership Announcement&lt;/strong&gt;  💰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is been lots of speculation and rumors over the past few month from various sources, ranging from Facebook $FB being the sole purchaser for cash up front and/or a partnership deal, to a group of parties. The range of the deal is said to be worth $1 Billion to $2 Billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last conference call, CEO John Chen said that there is about an &amp;quot;80% probability that the deal closes by Q4&amp;quot;. This date is November 2021, which is next week. However, they could also be waiting to release it during their next earnings call on December 21st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/8xyowycxdm181.png?width=936&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=40ff564570e406d24aba3aa07c6e2ab7fc688ede&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8xyowycxdm181.png?width=936&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=40ff564570e406d24aba3aa07c6e2ab7fc688ede&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QNX, IoT (Internet of Things), Amazon IVY and the connected car ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;  👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QNX real-time OS is installed in 195M cars today, out of 1.4B cars in total on the road worldwide. QNX enables many different software pieces to run in a car, so acts as a kind of central control unit. QNX is becoming the predominant OS for connected cars, since it´s installed in so many cars. Whilst today $BB licenses QNX to OEMs on a per-unit royalty basis, QNX is effectively set up (through Blackberry Ivy, in partnership with $AMZN) to be the foundation of the data value chain for the auto industry, which McKinsey estimates will be quite big, specially for a company ($BB) with a market cap of $6 Billion today. I think this will extend to other verticals over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the North American and Japanese automakers, BlackBerry QNX also have partnerships with Chinese EV&amp;#39;s such as $XPEV and $BIDU (who plans to make EV&amp;#39;s in the future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CES 2022 BB will be demonstrating both cyber and IoT with key partners&lt;/strong&gt;  👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry has started testing their BETA version of IVY with Amazon this fall and are looking to showcase more features and capabilities with key partners at the CES in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/mou8wkvvem181.png?width=970&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=19e8d506ece446890b7c2d1cc4c71ceb2eb9116d&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mou8wkvvem181.png?width=970&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=19e8d506ece446890b7c2d1cc4c71ceb2eb9116d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the last conference call, BlackBerry announced that they hired John Giamatteo from McAfee to lead BlackBerry&amp;#39;s cyber security business unit&lt;/strong&gt;  👌&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John&amp;#39;s executive experience and connections should be BlackBerry generate sales in their current vertices and new market opportunities down the road, for both enterprise and consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bc6p1ukyrm181.png?width=1809&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4086560904724b639c23d7e31c62ed2637ea0c88&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bc6p1ukyrm181.png?width=1809&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4086560904724b639c23d7e31c62ed2637ea0c88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BlackBerry continues to win Awards and is issued/granted new patents every month&lt;/strong&gt;  😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, SE Labs  independently-owned and run testing company that assesses security products and services ranked BlackBerry as #1 in New Endpoint system security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quote: ”2021 has been the first year we have tested this product with BlackBerry publicly. When judging for our annual awards it is hard to ignore when a new, significant vendor enters our tests and performs so well from the start,&amp;quot; said Simon Edwards, CEO SE Labs. Blackberry has demonstrated excellent performance in our &amp;#39;real-world&amp;#39; testing, and the product is well regarded by both our expert panel of judges and users of the product. We would like to congratulate BlackBerry on achieving the award for best new endpoint.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/3ex9n1e6dn181.png?width=1717&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=475bfe9f0915690869d597cba115e52a1d1aa758&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3ex9n1e6dn181.png?width=1717&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=475bfe9f0915690869d597cba115e52a1d1aa758&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional Funds are loading up BIGLY&lt;/strong&gt;  👀 🔍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past months, big institutions have been increasing their position. Today for example, Morgan Stanley&amp;#39;s 13F filing showed that they alone increased their $BB holdings by +51%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they have insider info about the patent sale and/or other news? Could a Price Target increase be coming soon now that they  have loaded up on shares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5awqbg901n181.png?width=1336&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a840cfdc381ad91d898286a2f6fff969e6696b1d&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5awqbg901n181.png?width=1336&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a840cfdc381ad91d898286a2f6fff969e6696b1d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;  📈  🚀 🍋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekly chart is a tight equilibrium pattern looking to break out on the bullish catalyst(s). Price target $30+ by early next year. Some UOA (Unusual Options Activity) also showed up today too.&lt;/p&gt;

There is no employer match. I looked at the plan&amp;#39;s offerings and saw it had Vanguard target index funds with a fee of only .13%. I was excited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my dad had a meeting with the rep to sign up and it turns out his 457 plan adds a fee of .45% and another fee of .65% on top of .13% charged by Vanguard. So the total cost to invest in this Vanguard index fund is 1.23%, whereas you can invest directly with Vanguard for only .13%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the rep actually allocated 90% of the portfolio to an actively managed T Rowe Price target date fund with a final fee of 1.51% because the rep said the T Rowe Price fund had a better performance history than Vanguard. The final 10% the rep allocated to an actively managed REIT with a final fee of 1.98%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel horrible for my dad. Is he getting screwed or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the fees are so high it is my understanding it&amp;#39;s still better for my dad to do this because  of tax advantages. Of course I explained to my dad he should be maxing out his self directed IRA first and then contribute to the 457 plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention the rep for the 457 plan said the average mutual fund cost in the U.S. is 1.5%. Is this actually true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity purpose I was buying whole number of shares within $1,000 in each strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy #1: buy next day (after the show) and sell EOD:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total gain was $1907.38

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the average # of buy recommendations ~$11,500 of capital needed per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~16.59% total gain -&lt;/strong&gt; not bad but below S&amp;amp;500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy #2: buy next day (after the show), hold 5 days and sell EOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total gain was $27,720.31

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the average # of buy recommendations ~$57,500 of capital needed per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48.2% total gain&lt;/strong&gt; - now we are talking business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Toyota has announced it will be back to full global production capacity in December. In fact, the company says it anticipates churning out 800,000 vehicles next month, up from the 760,000 it made in December of 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume they&amp;#39;re storing CPUs and other parts and have modified the Toyota Production System to get around this. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s signs of the shortage ending. Trust Toyota to find a way out of all the car companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought it was an interesting bit of news, maybe they will benefit from this while other automakers struggle to get cars delivered, or maybe they won&amp;#39;t because people are willing to wait for the cars they want&lt;/p&gt;

Wealthfront has me invested in dividends stocks (SCHD) at some nominal percentage (maybe 10% of portfolio) for a taxable account. I had read a post the other day where someone had commented, “why are you investing in dividend ETFs, are you retired?” Is this a consideration? Should I not be in dividend yielding ETFs unless I’m in retirement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: only about 20% of my portfolio is in WF and I manage everything else myself. I just get $40k managed free there and they do tax loss harvesting well. So I’m really wondering if I should be more in on dividend ETFs in my other taxable accounts or prioritizing more toward like VTI (which I’m heavily in as well). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: are higher dividend yielding ETFs like SCHD worth holding for a younger investor?&lt;/p&gt;

Then, a month later he dumps $42 million worth of his shares right after the stock had already fallen by about 25%. Basically making it look like he had no faith in his own company after his wild and outlandish claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning Karp was on CNBC. They asked if he was going to stop diluting the shares. He said point blank that dilution would continue in the form of employee compensation. He simply alleged that the stock price would rise despite dilution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me lose faith in PLTR. That and the fact that Karp looks so ridiculous all the time with his uncombed hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if I should cut down to 3 months in the medium risk portfolio for a total of 6 months worth of emergency fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would invest the difference in a more aggressive portfolio for retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or should I just stick with the 9 month emergency fund like I have it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Am leaning towards cashing out the AWP and buying 3-months expenses of i-bonds and keep 3 months cash for spending and small emergencies. I will invest the difference in my 3 fund portfolio. Is this better and adequate?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathie Wood — known for her innovation ETFs that garnered billions in inflows during the pandemic — said Ark Invest is internally testing a fund that takes the strategy a step further by simultaneously betting against major stocks in the benchmarks that are being disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think the benchmarks are where the big risks are long-term because they are filling up with value-traps, those companies that have done very well historically but are going to be disintermediated and disrupted by the massive amount of innovation that’s taking place,” Wood added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like Cathie Wood had found another way to attract investors money. People buying on these ark funds need to understand that the stocks inside are very random. Investors might easily lose money since many of them do not even realize what are they buying and investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an ETF that is shown moving by a few cents at a time, what kind of price action could explain a drop of 21c and then back up 20c in less than a second?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a transaction large enough to move the ETF price that much occurs, how would it not become visible on public charting like Yahoo finance?&lt;/li&gt;

Just a few residual logistical questions to confirm from seasoned users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall context - my family currently holds an emergency fund consisting of 12 months of expenses, in a ‘high yield’ saving account (0.4% right now). My thought is to start building an I bond ladder so that half of the emergency stash is there, with the balance remaining in readily available cash. If anyone thinks this is not a prudent idea for emergency funds I’m happy to understand why or alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After holding an I Bond for the minimum first year, how soon are the funds available (i.e a few business days for the bank transfer)? This is in the context of being emergency funds (and I know I’d lose the three months interest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm the timing of rate transfers, you are guaranteed the current rate for six months from your purchase date, and not up to the next May or November official rate change? For example, if I buy bonds in November, I get the current rate through April. If I buy next April, I’m still guaranteed the current rate through September, because I bought before the May switch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family consists of my spouse and infant child. If I was only interested in buying 20k in bonds per year (right now at least) - would it be logistically more efficient to set up my account and create a linked minor account for my child, to manage everything in one place? Or, safer to set up separate accounts for myself and spouse? I understand that I would have to delink and transfer my child’s holdings back to me while they were still a minor, but I’ve got 17 years until I’d need to worry about that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insight or tips are appreciated, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

The general consensus is that this likely will not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,  one thing that *IS* likely to happen - is that the stock price will drop after the dividend date (thus making the above strategy useless). I&amp;#39;m assuming then, and correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong, that the stock price will eventually recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this &amp;quot;recovery&amp;quot; then due to natural stock *growth* or is the recovery some sort of market mechanism specific to dividend stocks where naturally money flows back into the stock after the post-dividend drop? (I&amp;#39;m aware this could be a distinction without a difference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If recovery for many stocks is inevitable then I&amp;#39;m surprised I haven&amp;#39;t seen much discussion about investment strategies where you purchase the stock after the post-dividend drop? What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANSWERED: The assumption that the stock price will drop after the dividend date or that the stock price will recover is incorrect. Thanks to those who answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Glad to see reddit is as toxic as ever for asking a question - please get some sunshine. I find it astonishing because if you asked a question like this in real life you&amp;#39;d just get a normal answer from a normal person.&lt;/p&gt;
