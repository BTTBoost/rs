At $3300, it’s the time to at least initiate a position if you don’t have one already.</li>\n<li>$AMZN currently sits at an IV rank of 1%. That means over the past year the IV has been higher 99% of the time. What makes IV swell? Earnings. What happens when IV swells? The price of the underlying option goes up.</li>\n<li>The S&amp;P 500 is up 19.26% YTD, 30.66% over the past 365 days. $AMZN is essentially flat in both regards and is the worst-performing FAANG name on a yearly basis. Comparatively, FAANG names like $GOOG and $MSFT have far outperformed the S&amp;P. [1]</li>\n<li>$AMZN is breaking out of a descending wedge with large gaps to fill in the 3400-3600 range. [2] I know a lot of you believe TA is voodoo, but there are people with a lot of money who trade according to fun shapes on a chart, and their trades move price action just as much as anyone else’s. Whether it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy or a crystal ball, we have to pay some attention when the Technical Analysis people start crowing en masse, and that’s what’s happening here.</li>\n<li>Antitrust is not a headwind here. One, because the likelihood of any significant antitrust legislation getting by the powerful lobbying force of $AMZN is nil. And two, because if split, $AMZN (and $GOOG)’s businesses would likely each command higher valuations. And on that note:</li>\n<li>Barron’s on $AMZN: “Valuing AWS at 15x 2023 sales gives you a market cap of $1.5T, meaning that investors are getting Amazon’s e-commerce business and its nascent advertising business almost for free.” [3] Barron’s isn’t the only publication to recently recognize this, but I hesitate to link to anything Motley has done because I have more self-respect than that.</li>\n<li>Out of 64 analysts who have covered $AMZN in the past year, all 64 rank the stock as a buy. [4]</li>\n<li>CEO Andy Jassy lowered upcoming ER expectations considerably in the past ER, which is what caused the sell-off. For those of you who don’t know, doubt is a good thing. Lowered expectations are a good thing. Because the bar for $AMZN’s October quarter has been lowered tremendously, it’ll be that much easier to achieve a strong beat, and a positive surprise.</li>\n<li>Amazon-backed Rivian&#39;s EV is set to roll out in September, one month before the ER hype begins to build. It isn&#39;t the biggest deal in the world, but it&#39;s going to give analysts some more fuel to write positive articles about $AMZN&#39;s future growth opportunities and maybe bump up a few price targets, all of which are sitting well above $AMZN&#39;s current price.</li>\n<li>I put this at the end because it is the most speculative point, but the possibility of a split still looms. If they announce a split, forget all this, sell your house, and all-in your life savings, because that would change the game. Not only because $AMZN is literally (on a price basis, not a valuation basis) an expensive stock with even more expensive options (Which Jassy currently owns many, many of), but because it would almost inevitably lead to $AMZN’s Dow inclusion, a forced buying event similar in nature to $TSLA’s SPY inclusion. Tl;dr: It’d be in both the shareholder&#39;s and Jassy’s best interest (if he ever wants to be able to sell any of those options, that is) to split the stock.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Summary: It’s oversold, many HF’s bought in last quarter at a much higher price, Jassy gave himself a low bar for their first quarter under new management (Common among new CEOs), and the IV is at a one year low. Buy November calls near the money for a bounce, or just to hold. Grab some here, double down if we dip to $3200, and at every $100 dip to follow. Those of you who remember me from my last account know that I put my money where my DD is, and this post is no different:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/tlMU8yO\">Imgur.com/gallery/tlMU8yO</a></p>\n\n<p>Updates to come.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mukund/status/1429888554742665224/photo/1\">https://twitter.com/mukund/status/1429888554742665224/photo/1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/traderstewie/status/1429888383736696833/photo/1\">https://twitter.com/traderstewie/status/1429888383736696833/photo/1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/big-tech-apple-microsoft-alphabet-amazon-facebook-stock-51629429127\">https://www.barrons.com/articles/big-tech-apple-microsoft-alphabet-amazon-facebook-stock-51629429127</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrendSpider/status/1429971720748769300/photo/1\">https://twitter.com/TrendSpider/status/1429971720748769300/photo/1</a></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pbbrx0/10_reasons_to_buy_amzn_november_calls_ahead_of/","title":"10 Reasons to Buy $AMZN November Calls Ahead of Earnings (With Proof Of Positions)","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-26T04:29:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-26 04:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"bda84464-1659-59dc-af75-92cf9f4c790c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pbbrx0/10_reasons_to_buy_amzn_november_calls_ahead_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pbbrx0/10_reasons_to_buy_amzn_november_calls_ahead_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"LostToAModIn7Moves","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LostToAModIn7Moves","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"LostToAModIn7Moves","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"決算を前に$AMZNの11月コールを買うべき10の理由（ポジションの証明付き","the_new_excerpt":"ややこしいことはやめましょう。\n\n 1. $AMZNは、過去の決算で失望して以来、コンソリデーションを行っており\n     3200ドルレベルの強固な支持を得ている。3300ドルの時点では、少なくとも\n     まだポジションを持っていないのであれば、少なくともポジションを開始する時期です。\n 2.AMZNは現在、IVランクが1%.... となっている。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"盈利前买入$AMZN 11月看涨期权的10个理由（附持仓证明","the_new_excerpt":"我们不要把事情搞得太复杂。\n\n 1.AMZN自从过去的收益令人失望以来一直在巩固，并在3200美元的水平找到了坚实的支撑。\n     在3200美元的水平上找到了坚实的支撑。在3300美元，现在至少是时候\n     如果你还没有头寸的话，现在至少应该开始建仓了。\n 2.AMZN目前的IV等级为1%....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"盈利前買入$AMZN 11月看漲期權的10個理由（附持倉證明","the_new_excerpt":"我們不要把事情搞得太複雜。\n\n 1.AMZN自從過去的收益令人失望以來一直在鞏固，並在3200美元的水平找到了堅實的支撐。\n     在3200美元的水平上找到了堅實的支撐。在3300美元，現在至少是時候\n     如果你還沒有頭寸的話，現在至少應該開始建倉了。\n 2.AMZN目前的IV等級爲1%....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2ff305e7-f740-5193-a0b7-202e6fff8c3f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pbp39y/im_tired_of_being_poor_i_just_want_to_help_my/","title":"I'M TIRED OF BEING POOR!
