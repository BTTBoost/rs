It pegs Robinhood’s valuation at about $32 billion, far higher than the nearly $12 billion it fetched in a funding round a year ago but below the lofty prior expectations of some investors and bankers.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood has said it and some executives would sell 55 million shares, so the offering should yield more than $2 billion.</p>\n\n<p>The price reflects both hesitation on the part of some investors, who bristled at what they saw as the high valuation Robinhood sought, as well as a conscious decision by the company and its underwriters to be conservative in order to help set up a successful first-day of trading, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Next up for Robinhood is its trading debut, which the company will make Thursday on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol HOOD. It is a markedly different debut than the traditional IPO. While most companies only allocate a small amount of stock to individual investors at the time of their IPOs, Robinhood sold a big chunk of its IPO shares to individual investors over its new platform that gives users access to IPOs before they start trading.</p>\n\n<p>That high individual investor allocation is an X factor for Thursday’s debut. The large chunk in the hands of individual investors-—as well as the buzz around Robinhood by other individual investors who didn’t receive shares in the IPO—represents a wildcard, and some traders at banks that underwrite big IPOs say it is hard to predict how that will impact the stock at the open.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood’s decision earlier this year to stop users from buying meme stocks like GameStop Corp. GME -5.28% during the height of the frenzy for such shares rankled some investors and could prompt some to eschew the offering.</p>\n\n<p>Past IPOs in which a significant percentage of shares were allocated to individual investors have struggled. In 2012, Facebook Inc. FB 1.49% sold about 25% of its IPO to individual investors. The stock closed slightly above its $38 IPO price in a rocky first day of trading before tumbling the next day, in part because many individual investors received more stock than they wanted. It took more than a year for Facebook to close above its IPO price again. In 2006, Vonage Holdings Corp. VG 0.56% allowed longtime customers to buy into its IPO. Its stock also wobbled in early trading.</p>\n\n<p>The Robinhood listing is another landmark in a historic boom in IPOs as a rising stock market and hearty investor appetite entice a slew of successful private companies to shift to public ownership. Some 20 companies are going public each week this year, according to Dealogic. Traditional IPOs had raised more than $98 billion as of Tuesday, on the cusp of surpassing all of 1999 and 2000 as the biggest year ever for U.S.-listed IPOs.</p>\n\n<p>In the nearly seven years since it launched its app, Robinhood has gone from a tiny startup to one of the largest U.S. retail brokerages. The firm, which popularized zero-commission trades, says its mission is to democratize investing. It is a philosophy Robinhood reinforced Saturday by hosting a live-streamed roadshow presentation for individual investors.</p>\n\n<p>As of the end of June, the firm had 22.5 million funded accounts and its users held about $100 billion of assets on the Robinhood platform.</p>\n\n<p>The company went viral earlier this year when millions of amateur investors downloaded its app to participate in the explosive rally in meme stocks like GameStop. The breakout moment nearly broke Robinhood, as the company had to restrict purchases of some high-flying stocks and raise billions of dollars in emergency capital to meet regulatory requirements that kicked in because of the increased trading volumes.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood bounced back and continued to attract new users, but, more recently, it flagged that its growth is slowing. The company said in a securities filing last week that it expects its third-quarter revenue to fall relative to the second quarter, partially due to decreased trading activity.</p>\n\n<p>Its popularity has brought increased regulatory scrutiny too. In the past nine months, the company has agreed to pay more than $130 million to settle investigations into a range of its business practices. There could be more on the way: Robinhood disclosed this week that it got a new request for information from Wall Street’s self-regulatory body, Finra.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-ipo-prices-at-38-a-share-11627515866?mod=hp_lead_pos7\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-ipo-prices-at-38-a-share-11627515866?mod=hp_lead_pos7</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/otm5c9/robinhood_ipo_prices_at_38_a_share_at_the_low_end/","title":"Robinhood IPO Prices at $38 a Share; at the low end of expectations, after the popular trading platform met tepid demand","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-29T01:38:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-29 01:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9786e21a-8bd3-57b0-a06b-d884b1bb894c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/otm5c9/robinhood_ipo_prices_at_38_a_share_at_the_low_end/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/otm5c9/robinhood_ipo_prices_at_38_a_share_at_the_low_end/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"backup2thebackup2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/backup2thebackup2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"backup2thebackup2","score":1924,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロビンフッドのIPO価格は1株38ドル、人気の高いトレーディング・プラットフォームの需要が低調だったため、予想の下限となりました。","the_new_excerpt":"ロビンフッド・マーケッツ社は、1株あたり38ドルで新規株式公開の価格を決定しました。\n人気の高いトレーディング・プラットフォームであるRobinhood Markets Inc.\n人気の高いトレーディング・プラットフォームであるRobinhood Markets Inc.\n\n同社と引受会社が選んだ価格は、1株あたり38ドルから42ドルの範囲の底辺に位置する。\n1株あたり38ドルから42ドルの範囲内である。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Robinhood的IPO价格为每股38美元；在流行的交易平台遇到不温不火的需求后，处于预期的低端","the_new_excerpt":"Robinhood Markets Inc.以每股38美元的价格进行了首次公开募股，处于预期的低端。\n在这个受欢迎的交易平台满足了对其备受期待的首次公开募股的不温不火的需求之后，该公司将其首次公开募股的价格定在了预期的低端。\n其备受期待的首次公开募股的需求不大。\n\n该公司及其承销商选择的价格位于每股38至42美元区间的底部。\n该公司及其承销商选择的价格处于每股38美元至42美元范围的底部...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood的IPO價格爲每股38美元；在流行的交易平臺遇到不溫不火的需求後，處於預期的低端","the_new_excerpt":"Robinhood Markets Inc.以每股38美元的價格進行了首次公開募股，處於預期的低端。\n在這個受歡迎的交易平臺滿足了對其備受期待的首次公開募股的不溫不火的需求之後，該公司將其首次公開募股的價格定在了預期的低端。\n其備受期待的首次公開募股的需求不大。\n\n該公司及其承銷商選擇的價格位於每股38至42美元區間的底部。\n該公司及其承銷商選擇的價格處於每股38美元至42美元範圍的底部...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c0f386c5-8103-5e61-8dcf-d2ddcf915167","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otascd/10k_90k_because_fuck_blizzardactivision/","title":"10k -> 90k because fuck Blizzard/Activision","date":"July 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"10k -> 90k because fuck Blizzard/Activision","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"1万->9万，因为他妈的暴雪/动视。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"1萬->9萬，因爲他媽的暴雪/動視。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-13a4b200-c475-5c62-b5b2-197f041be595","excerpt":"Earnings per share: $1.15, adjusted, vs. $1.12 expected in a Refinitiv survey of\nanalysts\n\nRevenue: $6.24 billion vs. $6.27 billion expected\n\nSecond quarter net profit dropped 23% from a year earlier to $1.18 billion, and\nthe company added 11.4 million net new active accounts, for a total of…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/otihnx/paypal_reports_weak_q2_results/","title":"Paypal reports weak Q2 results","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 29, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ペイパル、低調な第2四半期決算","the_new_excerpt":"一株あたりの利益 1.15ドル（調整後）、予想は1.12ドル（Refinitiv調査）。\nアナリスト\n\n売上高：62億4,000万ドル（予想：62億7,000万ドル\n\n第2四半期の純利益は、前年同期比23％減の11億8,000万ドルとなりましたが\n新規アクティブアカウント数は1,140万件となり、合計で...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"支付宝公布第二季度业绩疲软","the_new_excerpt":"每股收益。调整后为1.15美元，而Refinitiv的调查显示，预期为1.12美元。\n分析师的调查中，预期为1.12美元。\n\n收入：62.4亿美元，预期62.7亿美元\n\n第二季度净利润比去年同期下降23%，至11.8亿美元，而\n该公司增加了1140万个新的活跃账户，总数为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"支付寶公佈第二季度業績疲軟","the_new_excerpt":"每股收益。調整後爲1.15美元，而Refinitiv的調查顯示，預期爲1.12美元。\n分析師的調查中，預期爲1.12美元。\n\n收入：62.4億美元，預期62.7億美元\n\n第二季度淨利潤比去年同期下降23%，至11.8億美元，而\n該公司增加了1140萬個新的活躍賬戶，總數爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-9786e21a-8bd3-57b0-a06b-d884b1bb894c","previousId":"RedditPost-c0f386c5-8103-5e61-8dcf-d2ddcf915167","nextId":"RedditPost-13a4b200-c475-5c62-b5b2-197f041be595","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/otm5c9/robinhood_ipo_prices_at_38_a_share_at_the_low_end/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
