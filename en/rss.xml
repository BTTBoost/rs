Despite the great demand for it, prices are still volatile and the whole situation is pretty messy tbh. It’s somewhat confusing to me because I thought that if the demand is high and producers are struggling to comply, then the prices should go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also thinking if my worries are warranted, especially since I have some copper stocks in my portfolio and I made investments recently too, placing some money in juniors. I know they’re a pretty risky investment, but I always remind myself to invest money I am willing t&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is Oroco Resources (ORRCF) which recently uncovered extensive copper deposits. The drilling activities that commenced in their&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orocoresourcecorp.com/projects/santo-tomas/&quot;&gt; Santo Tomas Project&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the presence of polymetallic copper mineralization. They hold 100% interest in two contiguous mineral concessions in Guerrero, Mexico which are included in their project in Xochipala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also placed some on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threevalleycopper.com/&quot;&gt; Three Valley Copper&lt;/a&gt; (TVC) since they’re pretty much on a roll recently. They will start mining next month or in early 2022 and are expected to have an annual production between 13,000 and 16,000 tonnes of copper cathode by 2023. The company recently announced an upsize with a recent deal financing to $16 million due to investor demand. Also just last month they released their second quarter results where they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m going to hold back from investing despite the price dip because I’m pretty anxious because of the whole situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumor has it, that Rep. Mace (R) from SC is proposing a bill to legalize Marijuana at the Federal level. &amp;quot;Those who’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/republicans-pot-bill-to-propose-lower-taxes-more-state-control&quot;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; Mace’s draft say it would regulate cannabis more like alcohol&amp;quot;. This bill coming from the republican side may garner more support than Sen. Schumer&amp;#39;s already proposed bill. &amp;quot; Mace’s proposed excise tax is 3.75%, according to Cobb -- a fraction of the 25.5% that Schumer’s legislation would put on marijuana products.&amp;quot; Personally, I&amp;#39;ve heard this bill could be brought forward as early as Monday 11/15. But, that&amp;#39;s just chatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, which dank stock should I buy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve looked at various companies and honestly diversifying into a few may be worth it. However, I have the greatest conviction in &lt;strong&gt;$TLRY&lt;/strong&gt; the largest market share in Canada, Germany, and ties to the US with Sweetwater brewing. Those with the greatest dependence on the US may outperform. But, screw the fundamentals because that&amp;#39;s not how this market works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*for simplicity I&amp;#39;ll just illustrate $TLRY to represent the Marijuana sector since it has the largest market cap*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutions buying $420M+?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Institutions have been buying these Cannabis companies as they blew off earlier in the year. Heaviest buying has been in $TLRY with the heaviest selling in $SNDL. Interestingly most of the buys come during Q2 which means most of these institutional apes are holding some serious bags. They could be down anywhere from -4% to -33% depending on when they bought in Q2. So, don&amp;#39;t be surprised if this gets pumped and ultimately dumped to lighten their bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n0904d0bzmz71.png?width=2386&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fb69d29fe355abc07e40a01cc412993d9f8b3b3b&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n0904d0bzmz71.png?width=2386&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fb69d29fe355abc07e40a01cc412993d9f8b3b3b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaders in the Sector?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$ACB&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;$SNDL&lt;/strong&gt; currently lead the move upward as they are right at their 200-day moving average. Does that mean they&amp;#39;ll continue leading the way? I don&amp;#39;t know. Does that mean the others have more to run? I can&amp;#39;t see the future, you twit. As a result, diversifying in this sector might be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crayons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears &lt;strong&gt;$TLRY&lt;/strong&gt; has started to round out and will try to push hire. The green lines are historical supply/demand lines at candle closes. I&amp;#39;m setting my stop near the recent low of $9.98 and will continue to sell out starting at $15.50 to $30.00 for a gain close to between 20% and 130%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/cssq7ipczmz71.png?width=2712&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80aa4805f62ae8a139a233ae266c836122544bd9&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cssq7ipczmz71.png?width=2712&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80aa4805f62ae8a139a233ae266c836122544bd9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Traction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I am choosing to look at &lt;strong&gt;$TLRY&lt;/strong&gt; is because of all the weed stocks, &lt;strong&gt;$TLRY&lt;/strong&gt; gains the most attention on google trends and is the 2nd most mentioned on WSB behind &lt;strong&gt;$SNDL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally have none and plan on buying Monday with any of you that like the stock(s). I&amp;#39;ll update after buys are in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*This is literally my uneducated, unlicensed opinion. Don&amp;#39;t listen to me. You&amp;#39;ll Lose money\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

As the market goes up they raise their stop price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was wondering how this would work if the market is closed, or if the circuit breakers kick in, and when the market re-opens the prices are all well below their limit/stop price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, lets say the Dow closes at 36,000 and some terrible news event occurs overnight there might be no way people would be able to exit their positions at 36,000. They wlll have to sell after the market opens right? And the market wil open much lower than 36,000.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if word gets out that certain investors were able to sell, while retail investors were unable to get their orders filled this could lead to a full scale revolt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this concern legitimate, or are their controls in place to prevent retail investors from getting hosed while the well connected all exit their long positions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-just-called-technology-140000074.html&quot;&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-just-called-technology-140000074.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting use of terminology.  “Market cap” is the market value of a publicly-traded company&amp;#39;s outstanding shares.  Therefore, I’m to take it that AI is an opportunity for a single company to be worth 80T. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphabet is one of the leaders in the AI space; at an almost $2T market cap, they would need to grow 45% YoY over the next 10 years to hit 80T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost any other company in the world would need significantly more growth to get to $80T. No one would have thought APPL would be a $2.5T company 10 years ago when they were $335b, but to get there was a 20% YoY growth from 2011 -&amp;gt; 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is she pulling this info from? How can she justify these claims?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? Do you see the possibility of an $80T company in 10 years? Will it come from AI?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389&quot;&gt;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How it is going:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this graphic on Twitter which visualizes his sales in relation to the performance of the Tesla share price: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RawBooty2/status/1459121681549733893&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that Elons sales continously move the price downwards. Please note that the graphic wasnt updated for fridays sales yet. I will update it as soon as its available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Now the interesting part We know how many shares he still has to sell !&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 17,3m shares (10% of 172,6m) minus what has been sold already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So that is 11,4m shares left for sale&lt;/strong&gt; since we know from SEC files he sold 4,9m shares until friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I copied all the SEC files in one Excel document and calculated the sales volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we assume he will continue to sell 500 - 639k shares a day as he did the last three days that means &lt;strong&gt;he will be selling for another 18-23 trading days&lt;/strong&gt;. Which would be 8th dec - 15th dec&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we use this knowledge ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I assume and the chart proves it that the buyers will not be willing to jump in front of the bus while Elon dumps his shares. So there is a really good chance we see lower prices until he is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately i cant include pictures in this post. I will give you guys a link to a post with pictures in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a rise in SP on Wednesday but he filed his first SEC report on Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So ever since it is public knowledge that he &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; started selling and how much he sells it was going down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How to play it:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see several possibilities to take profit from this knowledge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold puts until Elon is almost done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell a part of holding now and buy it back later at lower prices (some say thats what EMusk might intend to do)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold puts until Elon is done and reinvest your gains in calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the daily patterns, caused by Elons broker dumping shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, i cant post pictures here. I will include the link to the pictured post in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might notice that each day from Wednesday to Friday starts with a dip and then a mini rally which peaks between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM. Followed by descending prices through the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently i am holding puts which i bought last monday and wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no financial advisor and please dont regard this as any form of advice or recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do your own due dilligence!&lt;/p&gt;

I want to be able to grow my portfolio to be good for long term investing, as I’d like to be able to accumulate dividend income later in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, trying to figure out what stocks could potentially blow up are fun as well, but I’ve grown to feel that’s just a bit unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I have about $950 invested in individual stocks on Robinhood and another $720 on Acorns. I currently own shares in APPL, ACB, RKT, CNK, and BLV. None of these 5 have done as much as I would have expected them to at this point in the year but it’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, hope this question makes sense, just want to learn how to make quality investments. What kind of research I need to do beforehand would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

If anyone has a sense on when the irrationality will end, it&amp;#39;s probably him and his advisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole thing about Elon trying to cash out some stock to pay taxes as a nice guy, was an obvious BS excuse. Then the media comes out saying his REAL intention is to pay taxes that are due. Brilliant, double play to cover for his personal cash out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Elon had faith that his stock still had room to grow, there is no chance in hell he&amp;#39;d be selling. He&amp;#39;d just be getting a loan to cover his tax liabilities, while his equity value increases. The fact that he&amp;#39;s trying to cash out shows he thinks it&amp;#39;s near peak and about to go down. All the media drama is just an attempt to retain value for as long as possible to distract and justify his cash out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s crazy how I see NO ONE talking about this... And instead it&amp;#39;s all about &amp;quot;clever redditors&amp;quot; seeing his real intentions are to cover his tax liability. No it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

For transparency, I have not yet fully disinvested from China (I&amp;#39;m only 22 and my funds at risk are minimal), but going forward it is something I&amp;#39;m increasingly aware of. Would recommend an hour of your time to listen. Even if you aren&amp;#39;t as bearish on China, it still is a thoughtful and honest approach to analyzing under the radar risks from an investor profiled in the Big Short for foreseeing the housing  crisis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) They expect the Fed to cut rates and only then do they buy the treasuries, or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) Some combination of the above?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t quite understand the argument for (a) because I doubt most investors decide to drop VTI or MSFT and buy and hold TLT for 18 years or whatever it&amp;#39;s average duration is, so it must only be a short term play (are they really expecting the down-turn to last the duration of TLT?), but why would it be safer than just holding cash or short/ultra-short bonds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if they really thought the currency was going to collapse, why not switch to another currency rather than locking into the USD with bonds that will get killed by inflation as the dollar collapses, so I don&amp;#39;t see how they are a flight to safety there either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a reflex, IPS/corporate investment rules-based, is it not wanting to keep large amounts of cash in bank accounts, or is it some combination of (b) and (c), i.e. a profit motive?&lt;/p&gt;

1. You can only pick one company, don’t post like 5 of them, it wont count
2. Company’s valuation needs to be at least $3 billion dollars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few hours I’ll update this post with which five I’ve picked and then begin my research with the goal of hopefully posting what I’ve found tonight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, valuations and fundamentals have mattered because the big institutions and the average retail investor thought they mattered. Even algos, which on some level were active at the onset of the 80&amp;#39;s were programmed and directed to sell off stock when the valuation became too absurd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I look at the Rivians and Nikolas of the world I start to think maybe they&amp;#39;re just a symptom of the larger mentality of the market, including institutions, including the algos that are programmed by humans that have normal human biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, if the larger consensus of the market.. from institutions to retail to the programmers making algos, was that only future potential growth mattered and nothing else, wouldn&amp;#39;t that theoretically mean that only growth and hype stocks would have growth and interest forever? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean on a purely theoretical level, if we reached a point where it was a consensus by the vast majority of investors from all levels and backgrounds was that speculation and growth wins the day, wouldn&amp;#39;t the market reflect that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean to say is the market can be a reflection of the risk appetite of the broad spectrum of humans investing and trading in it, and if that were to slowly shift would it be possible that value stocks or old blue chips are largely forgotten forever, or have a bad return versus hype/speculation/growth moving forward?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no one is a Warren Buffett anymore, why would Warren Buffett-esque stocks have any market beating returns? No one would invest in them (on a level compared to hype/speculation stocks). They&amp;#39;d just theoretically sit there at low valuations forever paying out dividends and what not, with their only real growth being from stock buy backs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a musing I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an econ prof who told my class that in the long run, he believed that inflation and money supply growth would match up. Many people tend to agree with this classical theory, so I took a few hours and looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found was that m2 money supply, since 1961 has compounded annually at about 7.1% while CPI inflation has compounded annually at about 3.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, based on the above facts I&amp;#39;d argue that, over the past 60 years inflation and money supply haven&amp;#39;t shown a relationship approximating the classical economic theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do you think M2 and inflation aren&amp;#39;t as correlated as economists tend to believe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume that $TSLA is NOT one of the most overvalued mega cap ever as many argue and &lt;strong&gt;I agree it is overvalued by a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. Not a huge TSLA fan here...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But ....let&amp;#39;s assume TSLA is fairly valued.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current market cap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$TSLA: 1T&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$RIVN: 127B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ratio of market cap: 7.8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to judge RIVN on current (near zero) revenue. Let&amp;#39;s look at 2 years out and 9 years out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conservative forecast is that $TSLA can add &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/09/tesla-growth-in-the-next-two-years-2022-2023/&quot;&gt;1.21M&lt;/a&gt; vehicles to its yearly production. This is based on actual plants in/soon-to-be in production. Assuming 2021Q4 will grow at 15% over 2021Q3 (same growth from Q2 to Q3), TSLA would have produced 900M vehicles this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSLA 2021: 900M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TSLA 2023: 2.11M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TSLA 2030: Elon projects 20M&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be super optimistic, I will get back to it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand for TSLA? TSLA does not have a demand issue as Elon. For example, currently TSLA is the second largest EV in *CHINA*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s Look at RIVIAN ($RIVN) production forecast according to its own CEO, however ambitious and optimistic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIVN 2023: &lt;a href=&quot;https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/&quot;&gt;CEO projects 200K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIVN 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CEO projects at least 1M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Car production:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether in 2023 or 2030, TSLA will produce at least 10X as RIVN. I say at least because TSLA can prove based on current plans capacity it can deliver 2.1M in 2023, RIVN CEO cannot really prove that, but let&amp;#39;s take his work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much hype has been made about RIVN because F and AMZN invested in it. And AMZN has committed to purchase 100K vehicles over the next 5 years. Let&amp;#39;s put things into perspective: &lt;strong&gt;TSLA has proved its popularity in CHINA, EUROPE, and US vs. RIVN has a contract with AMZN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some misunderstanding by retail investors about RIVN:&lt;/strong&gt; Just because F and AMZN backed RIVN does not mean they will be giving RIVN free money OK?  IF that guarantees that RIVN can finance with future rounds (good thing), this will dilute your shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other production&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike TSLA, RIVN is ONLY a car company. TSLA produces solar, batteries, software, soon Lithium, + has proven it can navigate through shortages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think we all agree - even TSLA haters - that Elon is one of the smartest most innovative, most ambitious visionary with a long track record of success after success. We know nothing about Scaringe. He is definitely a smart guy, but it would be extremely extremely optimistic to think he can one up Elon on innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally we can talk about returns on your investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIVN remains largely pre-revenue, it has not proven itself yet. Therefore investors RIVN which is more risky play, needs to deliver higher returns than TSLA. &lt;strong&gt;No one would invest in a pre-revenue company if its expected return on investment does not exceed  more mature companies.&lt;/strong&gt; Would you invest in TSLA if the returns on its stock is not going to exceed that of KO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2030 TSLA/RIVN Car production only &lt;strong&gt;= 20x.&lt;/strong&gt; Let&amp;#39;s say Elon is too optimistic about 2030 and Scaringe is conservative, &lt;strong&gt;let&amp;#39;s say it is 15X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currently the market cap is only 7.8 X half of production ratio.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that even if TSLA&amp;#39;s non-car production (solar, software, chips, etc) does not materialize and is equal to zero (against all evidence) ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR/CONCLUSION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At fair valuation in 2030 &lt;strong&gt;with extremely generous assumption to RIVN&lt;/strong&gt; compared to TSLA &lt;strong&gt;the returns on your RIVN investment will be HALF of that of TSLA&lt;/strong&gt;.. (1+x)=2*(1+y)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the return on your TSLA stock is 100% ===&amp;gt; $RVN will be 0%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the return on your TSLA stock is 50% ===&amp;gt; $RVN will be -25%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the return on your TSLA stock is 0% ===&amp;gt; $RVN will be -50%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF TSLA crashes by 30% as some TSLA skeptics such as me believe it is possible, RIVN will have to crash by 65%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is under the assumption that TSLA (like RIVN) is only a car company and that RIVN will meet and exceed its goals in comparison to TSLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you invest in a pre-revenue company with lower returns than a mature company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond is victim of investor pressure for profits over developing research and long-term growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would you partner with big chains to introduce customers to something new and competitive to as something as powerful as meat? Meat consumers have context behind their diet and have eaten it in a number of ways and occasions. WHY WOULD FAST FOOD QUALITY PRODUCTION CONVINCE PEOPLE? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oatly understand consumer behavior and capitalized on the right trend. It had decades of research and recipe mastery before growing into public consciouness. It&amp;#39;s currently questioning willingness to pay due to shortage and inflationary pressures, and it knows how to disrupt larger players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate tattooed chef but at this point I would agree that it&amp;#39;s a better plant based investment than Beyond Meat. At the very least, Tattooed chef knows who to focus on and where to be discovered so that a customer COMES BACK FOR MORE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Meat will fail as a company. To me it was clear after they failed to deliver on chicken substitutes, which should have been easier to land and expand with but they didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea doesn&amp;#39;t suck. The company does.&lt;/p&gt;
