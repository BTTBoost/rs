The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both eeked out a new intraday record high, closing 0.07% and 0.17% higher respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.10% while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.67%. Market participants continue to digest comments from the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech from Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants wait for new, crucial economic data, namely the August Job Report, set to be released on Friday. </p>\n\n<p>Despite some choppiness near the middle of the month, the SPY closed out its seventh straight month of gains, rising nearly 3% during the month of August, bringing the performance of the index to a staggering 20% gain year-to-date. Despite the risk posed by potential inflationary pressures and the coronavirus Delta variant, market participants remain encouraged by the pace of the economic recovery, record corporate earnings, and a still accommodative Federal Reserve.</p>\n\n<p>ADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the offical August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody’s Analytics, said of the report, “The delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery. Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months. Job growth remains inextricably tied to the path of the pandemic.” </p>\n\n<p>I’ve talked about it the last few days, but here is the full transcript from Powell’s speech on Friday</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>According to the Department of Commerce, construction spending in the US rose 0.3% on a monthly basis and is up 9% year-on-year. The infrastructure bill currently mulling in Congress should be a further boost to this spending.</li>\n<li>Ford Motors (F) said it is forced to once again trim production due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. said it will cut two of three shifts at its Dearborn Truck Plant next week, while its Kansas City Assembly Plant F-150 production will be down. This is like the third of fourth time this has happened with no end of the chip shortage in sight. </li>\n<li>In tangentially related news, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that 2021 has been the year of “super crazy supply chain shortages” and pointed to delays in shipping. Here is the tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065\">https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065</a></li>\n<li>Twitter (TWTR) launched a “super follow” feature that allows creators to generate monthly revenue by sharing subscriber-only content. The company hopes the future will attain at least $7.5 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2023.</li>\n<li>After a steep sell-off following an intense regulatory crackdown by the CCP, shares of Chinese stocks were moving higher today.</li>\n<li>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it identified a 12th crash involving a Tesla (TSLA) vehicle using driver assistance software. This comes amid a probe for 11 crashes identified a few weeks ago. </li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) target raised by Argus from $215 to $225 at Buy.
