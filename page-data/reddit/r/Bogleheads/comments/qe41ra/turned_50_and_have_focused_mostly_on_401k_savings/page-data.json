We have no debt except for the mortgage. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t start doing any serious retirement savings, unfortunately, until I got to my late 30&#39;s. Since then I have increased my 401k contributions annually and am contributing to the max allowed each year. This is well over the matching my employer provides, which is 3% (I forget the exact calc but I have to contribute 6% to get the 3% match). I&#39;m contributing 18%.</p>\n\n<p>We have the Roth IRAs that we invested a few thousand into a long time ago, and I got lucky and changed the allocations about 7 years ago from some bad funds that a former advisor steered them to, to AAPL, TSLA, and a little SBUX. Those have done well but it&#39;s only $40k now as I never contributed.</p>\n\n<p>Ashamed to say but it just occurred to me that 401k distributions will be taxed upon withdrawal. I guess I just never worried about that before. I just always focused on getting as much in the 401k, along with cash for emergencies. We&#39;re cash flowing the current college expense but will need to either pinch a little or start dipping into the 529/cash during the two years both kids are in college at same time.</p>\n\n<p>The HSA I&#39;m in is relatively new. Had a decent traditional PPO plan but like many, my employer went cheap and now most of us are on a high deductible plan with an HSA. I just looked at it closely and I can only invest a couple hundred of the 1.2k that&#39;s sitting in it.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s why I&#39;m now all of a sudden concerned: wife and I have come to start really thinking about how we want to live our lives when in our 60&#39;s, and a big dream of ours is a vacation home (beach house). Right now, we&#39;d be looking at about $600k to buy a modest one in our desired location, so that could go up quite a bit in 10 years. I had been thinking for years, no problem, use some of the 401k. But if it&#39;s taxed on the distributions then that&#39;s probably not a good idea.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m thinking my best option now is to begin maxing out the Roth IRAs each year going forward. Side note - those Roth accounts are through TDAmeritrade. As I wrote previously, right now its all in individual stocks. So going forward I&#39;m assuming I should go with index funds offered through TDAmeritrade (I haven&#39;t looked yet but will to see what they offer).</p>\n\n<p>Lastly - I have a well paying job that is fairly secure. I plan to work until at least 60 but likely will need to continue working until 65.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qe41ra/turned_50_and_have_focused_mostly_on_401k_savings/","title":"Turned 50 and have focused mostly on 401k savings to this point","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"October 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-23T15:54:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-23 15:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qe41ra","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qe41ra/turned_50_and_have_focused_mostly_on_401k_savings/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qe41ra/turned_50_and_have_focused_mostly_on_401k_savings/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"learnedfoolishness","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/learnedfoolishness","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"learnedfoolishness","score":40,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"50歳になり、これまでは主に401kでの貯蓄に集中してきました。","the_new_excerpt":"50歳、既婚、子供2人（1人は大学1年生、もう1人は高校3年生）。\n2023年に大学に進学予定の高校3年生）。)\n\n * 401K：120万円（すべてバンガードのインデックスファンドに投資\n * Roth IRA（妻と私）：40k（いくつかの個別株）。\n * HSA: 1.2k\n * 現金：80k\n * 529: 33k\n * ESPP: $10k\n * 私たちは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"50岁了，到现在为止主要集中在401k储蓄上","the_new_excerpt":"50岁，已婚，有两个孩子（一个是大学一年级，另一个是初中生\n在高中，计划在2023年上大学）。)\n\n * 401K：120万（都在Vanguard指数基金中）。\n * Roth IRAs（我和我的妻子）：4万（一些个人股票\n * HSA: 1.2k\n * 现金：8万\n * 529: 33k\n * ESPP: 10k\n * 我们...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"50歲了，到現在爲止主要集中在401k儲蓄上","the_new_excerpt":"50歲，已婚，有兩個孩子（一個是大學一年級，另一個是初中生\n在高中，計劃在2023年上大學）。)\n\n * 401K：120萬（都在Vanguard指數基金中）。\n * Roth IRAs（我和我的妻子）：4萬（一些個人股票\n * HSA: 1.2k\n * 現金：8萬\n * 529: 33k\n * ESPP: 10k\n * 我們...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1451640885536514048","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1451640885536514048","title":"Dow just bagged its first record close since Aug. 16 as Powell says U.S. might see 'maximum employment' in 2022 https://t.co/b7GloYXbyj","date":"October 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ダウは8月16日以来の記録的な大引けとなった。Powellは米国が2022年に「最大の雇用」を迎える可能性があると発言 https://t.co/b7GloYXbyj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"道指刚刚囊括了自8月16日以来的首个收盘纪录，因为鲍威尔说美国可能在2022年看到 \"最大就业 \"https://t.co/b7GloYXbyj。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"道指剛剛囊括了自8月16日以來的首個收盤紀錄，因爲鮑威爾說美國可能在2022年看到 \"最大就業 \"https://t.co/b7GloYXbyj。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qe43jw","excerpt":"Hey everyone, before writing this I use Snapchat myself so that may influence\nbias.
