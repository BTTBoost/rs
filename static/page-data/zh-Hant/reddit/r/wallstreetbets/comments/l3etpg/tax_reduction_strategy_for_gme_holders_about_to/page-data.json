This is just my retarded brain trying to think through this idea. I’m also not the first to propose this idea. Just remember I can’t read so I didn’t see those other posts. </p>\n\n<p>For those that have made mountains of sweet, sweet tendies from the GME 🚀🚀, I am wondering if the income tax increase that many of us will realize this year can be reduced by also helping our Tendiemaker directly. This is more specific to Itemized tax filers. If you file Standard, this will only benefit up to $300, which would still be a big deal if tons of us did this up to $300. Itemized filers can deduct up to 60% of their AGI.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: it was brought up that the $300 deduction only applies if the cash donation is given directly to the charity. I’m not verifying it, but it sounds plausible enough.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: As <a href=\"/u/whitemarshian\">u/whitemarshian</a> points out, a better alternative to this strategy could be to donate the shares directly to a donor advised fund. I had not considered this strategy, but this also sounds like good shit. Maybe someone could expand upon this thought and put together another post exploring this?</p>\n\n<p>SUPER EDIT: As <a href=\"/u/MichaelVicksPitbull\">u/MichaelVicksPitbull</a> points out, buying gift cards will show up on the balance sheet as Unearned Revenue. This increase in liabilities would be offset by the increase in cash from purchasing the gift cards, so there isn’t really a net advantage for GME’s financials until the gift card is redeemed. This would be an unlikely benefit for Q4.</p>\n\n<p>So here it is. Everyone fortunate enough to be aboard this moon shot heads over to their local GME before 1/31, and we collectively buy what amounts to hopefully millions of dollars in GME gift cards. We take those gift cards and donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children’s Hospital (St. Jude’s is well known, but I would suggest keeping your donations local to help your community) for them to buy electronics for their patients and patient families. My wife works for a Children’s Hospital, and there are many “entertainment areas” packed with electronics throughout the hospital where sick children get a chance to escape the fight and reality of being sick. This is also an extraordinary relief for young family members of patients and parents as they can be occupied while their sibling or child undergoes tests or procedures or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>We would be giving revenue a huge shot in the arm whenever the gift cards are redeemed, give GME tons of cash to end Q4, and by donating the gift cards to local charities you can reduce the tax burden on your gainz. This will also be a way for us to change the narrative and show those currently besmirching the name of WSB that we aren’t an army, we aren’t some nefarious insider trading collective, nor are we the thieves we are being painted out to be. We’re just a bunch of smooth brains trying to make money or lose it all for the sake of sweet sweet internet points.</p>\n\n<p>Doing this would also not only give you 🚀🚀🚀🚀 in your heart, but bless you with more 🚀🚀🚀🚀 when GME hits $1,000.</p>\n\n<p>If my true retardation is missing any of the key points, please let me know where I am misinterpreting the tax code and I will gladly amend this post.</p>\n\n<p>Position: 1,450 stonks, 4/16 $30c and 7/16 $35c</p>\n\n<p>More obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>TL:DR: Buy GME gift cards, donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children’s Hospital. Help sick children and their families. Reduce tax burden. Increase WSB love.</p>\n\n<p>For those telling me paying taxes isn’t so bad because they pay for roads and shit. All I have to say to that is “Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads”.    🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3etpg/tax_reduction_strategy_for_gme_holders_about_to/","title":"Tax Reduction Strategy for GME holders about to get bitch slapped by the IRS in 2021.
