The general consensus is that this likely will not work.</p>\n\n<p>However,  one thing that *IS* likely to happen - is that the stock price will drop after the dividend date (thus making the above strategy useless). I&#39;m assuming then, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, that the stock price will eventually recover.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is this &quot;recovery&quot; then due to natural stock *growth* or is the recovery some sort of market mechanism specific to dividend stocks where naturally money flows back into the stock after the post-dividend drop? (I&#39;m aware this could be a distinction without a difference)</li>\n<li>If recovery for many stocks is inevitable then I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t seen much discussion about investment strategies where you purchase the stock after the post-dividend drop? What am I missing?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>ANSWERED: The assumption that the stock price will drop after the dividend date or that the stock price will recover is incorrect. Thanks to those who answered.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Glad to see reddit is as toxic as ever for asking a question - please get some sunshine. I find it astonishing because if you asked a question like this in real life you&#39;d just get a normal answer from a normal person.</p>\n\n<p>No doubt the ones making sarky comments are the ones to have little experience in real life social interaction.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r0tgcm/purchasing_stocks_after_the_dividend_payment_date/","title":"Purchasing Stocks AFTER the Dividend Payment Date","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-24T04:52:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-24 04:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r0tgcm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r0tgcm/purchasing_stocks_after_the_dividend_payment_date/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r0tgcm/purchasing_stocks_after_the_dividend_payment_date/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"TheFlanker","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheFlanker","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TheFlanker","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"配当金支払日以降の株式購入について","the_new_excerpt":"配当落ち日前に配当銘柄を買って利回りを確保しようという記事をよく目にします。\n配当落ち前の株を買って利回りを確保し、その後売却するという記事をよく目にします。一般的には\nこれはうまくいかないだろうというのが一般的な意見です。\n\nしかし、1つだけ可能性があるのは、配当落ち後に株価が下がってしまうことです。\nの後に株価が下がることです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在股息支付日之后购买股票","the_new_excerpt":"我看到很多帖子都在讨论在除息日之前买入红利股票，试图获取收益率，然后卖出股票。\n在除息日之前买入股票，试图获取收益，然后卖出股票。人们普遍认为\n普遍的共识是，这很可能行不通。\n\n然而，有一件事是**可能发生的--那就是股价会在除息日之后\n跌。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在股息支付日之後購買股票","the_new_excerpt":"我看到很多帖子都在討論在除息日之前買入紅利股票，試圖獲取收益率，然後賣出股票。\n在除息日之前買入股票，試圖獲取收益，然後賣出股票。人們普遍認爲\n普遍的共識是，這很可能行不通。\n\n然而，有一件事是**可能發生的--那就是股價會在除息日之後\n跌。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r0qhib","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0qhib/1987_oct_19_black_monday/","title":"1987 Oct 19: Black Monday","date":"November 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"1987年10月19日：ブラックマンデー","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"1987年10月19日：黑色星期一","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"1987年10月19日：黑色星期一","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1463352169332105222","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1463352169332105222","title":"JAPAN COVID CASES DROP TO NEAR ZERO POST IVERMECTIN USAGE https://t.co/AF48cISDwM","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 24, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"japan covid cases drop to nearly zero post Iivermectin use https://t.co/AF48cISDwM","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"日本在使用伊维菌素后，ovid病例降至接近零 https://t.co/AF48cISDwM","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"日本在使用伊維菌素後，ovid病例降至接近零 https://t.co/AF48cISDwM","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-r0tgcm","previousId":"RedditPost-r0qhib","nextId":"TweetPost-1463352169332105222","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r0tgcm/purchasing_stocks_after_the_dividend_payment_date/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
