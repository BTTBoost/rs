I have a small cluster of small dollar stocks (usually less than $10) that are relatively established companies, but that always seem to waver between two price points - generally.  Over and over, I put in a buy order for about where I know the &quot;bottom&quot; is, with a profit exit somewhere around the typical &quot;top&quot;.  And it works.  And it works every time.  Sometimes I profit out in 3 days, sometimes 3 weeks, sometimes as much as 2 - 3 mos, but I haven&#39;t lost a dime, and I&#39;m (like I said) up a consistent 50% this year alone, last year was almost that much.</p>\n\n<p>I have regular money in my 401K, maxing my employer match, and it&#39;s doing great too.
