I&#39;ve learned a great deal during my journey, which started on this very forum. To parse the incredible amount of data that&#39;s available, I&#39;ve had to learn programing and (re-learn) data science. </p>\n\n<p>The end result of my efforts (so far) is a fully modular stock screener. It&#39;s able to pick and choose numbers from financial reports (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) and not only generate ratios, but as well as trends across time, and compare these companies to their peers. </p>\n\n<p>There are three limitations to this screener: the first is that the company must have four years of financial information available, so for example, the fan-favorite PLTR is not available. This is kind of by design, because established companies generally safer. The second limitation is that only fundamentals data is included, and price data + options data isn&#39;t. That will be addressed in the second part of my project, which deals mainly with risk management (ie: position sizing and diversification). The third limitation is that it&#39;s only limited to companies listed on the NASDAQ.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s an example output below: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/vu5GQ2N\">https://imgur.com/a/vu5GQ2N</a></p>\n\n<p>The first column is the slope of the trend in revenue (flat) over four years (in thousand/day), and the second column is the slope of the trend in net income (flat) over four years (in thousand/day), sorted by the first column. The stocks included in this search are the top 100 technological service companies by market cap. </p>\n\n<p>Why am I showing off? Well, the first part is a little affirmation for my work. The second part is beta testing. If there are any industry leaders you&#39;d like for me to look and compare fundamentals for, just provide the company and fundamentals and I&#39;ll see what I can do. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this post doesn&#39;t count as self promotion, as I&#39;m not looking to monetize this in any way shape or form, now and in the future. It&#39;s mostly for myself so that I can reduce the amount of research done, and as a programming exercise. </p>\n\n<p>Setting everything up cost me no money, so once I&#39;m done with the complete portfolio management system, I&#39;ll deploy it for free along with a white paper showing which metrics best describe the price.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/odxxgk/just_showing_off_a_bit/","title":"Just showing off a bit","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-05T05:18:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-05 05:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b501887e-e11b-5e40-9f51-2b68d2d4cdda","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/odxxgk/just_showing_off_a_bit/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/odxxgk/just_showing_off_a_bit/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ronin-of-the-5-rings","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ronin-of-the-5-rings","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ronin-of-the-5-rings","score":314,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ちょっとした自慢話","the_new_excerpt":"私は過去6年間、株式投資の方法について研究してきました。\n過去6年間、株式市場に投資する方法を研究してきました。このフォーラムから始まったこの旅で、私は多くのことを学びました。\nまさにこのフォーラムから始まった私の旅は、多くのことを学びました。膨大な量のデータを分析するために\n膨大な量のデータを解析するために、私はプログラミングを学び、データを学び直さなければなりませんでした...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"只是炫耀一下","the_new_excerpt":"所以，只说一下背景，我一直在研究如何投资于\n在过去的六年里，我一直在研究如何投资股市。在我的旅程中，我学到了很多东西。\n旅程中，我学到了很多东西，而这些东西正是从这个论坛开始的。为了解析大量的\n的数据，我不得不学习编程和（重新学习）数据......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"只是炫耀一下","the_new_excerpt":"所以，只說一下背景，我一直在研究如何投資於\n在過去的六年裏，我一直在研究如何投資股市。在我的旅程中，我學到了很多東西。\n旅程中，我學到了很多東西，而這些東西正是從這個論壇開始的。爲了解析大量的\n的數據，我不得不學習編程和（重新學習）數據......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1411819859344830466","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1411819859344830466","title":"This robot’s name is Oculus Prime \n\nhttps://t.co/lhBA3R9J84","date":"July 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"このロボットの名前は「Oculus Prime」。\n\nhttps://t.co/lhBA3R9J84","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"这个机器人的名字是Oculus Prime \n\nhttps://t.co/lhBA3R9J84","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"這個機器人的名字是Oculus Prime \n\nhttps://t.co/lhBA3R9J84","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-581b7de1-106c-5a55-bba4-1a1ace0dae1b","excerpt":"\"The Elder Days are gone.
