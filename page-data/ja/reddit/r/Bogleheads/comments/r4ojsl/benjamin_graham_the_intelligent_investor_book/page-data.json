Anything else is speculation.</li>\n<li>Speculators attitude toward stock market movements lies in trying to anticipate and profit from market fluctuations.</li>\n<li>Investor&#39;s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices.</li>\n<li>Unintelligent speculation is speculation when you think you are investing, any trades done on margin, doing it seriously instead of a pastime, risking more than you can afford to lose.</li>\n<li>If you are going to speculate, put a small amount aside and don&#39;t add money because you are up. Understand that you in fact are speculating and be prepared to lose.</li>\n<li>An investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying IPOs or &quot;Hot&quot; stocks</li>\n<li>Defensive Investor – Interested in safety and freedom from bother. Purchase investment funds vs creating a stock portfolio, use investment counsel firm, or dollar-cost average.</li>\n<li>Aggressive Investor – To enjoy a reasonable chance of success, the investor must follow policies which are sound and promising and are NOT popular on Wall Street.</li>\n<li>You must be either a defensive/conservative investor or an aggressive/enterprising investor. You can&#39;t be 50/50.</li>\n<li>Speculative stock movements are carried too far in both directions.</li>\n<li>Savings Accounts can also be a good choice in lieu of bonds.</li>\n<li>Do NOT buy on margin. You are speculating.</li>\n<li>If the investors funds are placed into high grade short maturity bonds (&amp;lt;7 years), he will not be affected by market prices.</li>\n<li>Longer term bonds and equities will vary during his lifetime and he must be prepared for this.</li>\n<li>Investment of most intelligent when it is most businesslike.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Defensive Investor</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Preferred Stocks are not usually a good investment. It carries no share in the company&#39;s profits beyond a fixed dividend. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal claim of a bondholder (Creditor) and the profit possibilities of a common stockholder (Partner). You are dependent on the ability and desire of the company to pay dividends on its common stock. They are under no obligation to pay you unless they pay the common shareholder. This investment vehicle is better for corporations.</li>\n<li>The choice of a corporate bond vs tax free municipal bond is made by the tax rate payed by the individual. Example – If a municipal pays 30% less than a corporate bond. The investor was at a tax bracket above 30% he would have a net saving by choosing the municipal bond. The opposite is true if the tax was below 30%. Usually tax-free bonds are better for individuals in high tax brackets.</li>\n<li>Only invest in high quality bonds – AAA, AA, A. Do NOT invest in lower quality (2nd grade) issues to get a higher return. Stay away from high yield &quot;Junk Bonds&quot;</li>\n<li>Rules for Defensive Common Stock Component – A. Adequate diversification but not excessive B. Company should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed C. Long record of dividend payments D. Have a limit on the price willing to pay. Say 25x average earnings over the last 7 years.</li>\n<li>Defensive investors should usually stay away from Growth Stocks.</li>\n<li>One of the most persuasive test of high quality is uninterrupted record of dividend payments for the last 20 years or more. The defensive investor might be justified in limiting his purchases to those.</li>\n<li>Stock Selection – Adequate size, strong financial condition (Current ratio 2/1), positive earnings for the past 10 years, uninterrupted dividends for the past 20 years, EPS growth of at least 33% in the past 10 years, P/E of less than 15 for the last 3 years earnings, current price not more than 1.5x book value</li>\n<li>Short vs Long Maturity Bonds – if the investor wants to assure himself against a decline in the principal of his bond but at the cost of a lower annual yield and loss of possibility of a gain in principal, pick short maturity bonds.</li>\n<li>It might be best for the conservative investor to concentrate on issues selling at a close approx. to their tangible asset value (book value). Say not more than 1/3 above that figure. Consider this a premium an extra fee paid for the advantage of a stock exchange listing and ability to quickly sell/buy.</li>\n<li>But just because a stock is selling for its book value doesn&#39;t make it a good investment. The investor should demand a satisfactory P/E ratio, strong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the year.</li>\n<li>The risk of paying too high a price for good quality issues is not the chief hazard confronting the average invest. Observation is that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low quality issues at times of favorable business conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Aggressive Investor</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Growth Stock – one which has increased their per share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common stocks and is generally expected to continue to do so.</li>\n<li>Growth stocks have 2 problems – Growth stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell at correspondingly high prices. The investor maybe right in his judgement of the prospects and still not do well. Merely because he overpaid for the expected prosperity. The 2nd is his judgment as the future may prove wrong. Rapid growth can&#39;t last forever.</li>\n<li>Stay away from IPO&#39;s/Common stock offerings. They tend to be offered in &quot;favorable&quot; market conditions for the sellers, not the buyers.</li>\n<li>The habit of the market is to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth, but it will also undervalue companies that are out of favor because unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.</li>\n<li>If looking at growth companies, concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a period of unpopularity. Smaller companies don&#39;t have the resources to withstand the storm and the market is slower to react to improvement vs larger companies.</li>\n<li>2 major sources of undervaluation. A. currently disappointing results and B. unpopularity. But make sure these are temporary and not permanent.</li>\n<li>The investor should require an indication of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past decade. No years of earnings deficit plus size and strength to meet possible setbacks. The ideal combination here is that of a large and prominent company selling both well below its past average price and its past average P/E ratio.</li>\n<li>Secondary Company – one that is not a leader in a fairly important industry. They tend to be undervalued at all times. Buy them only when they are at &quot;Bargain&quot; prices. Bargain being a stock that has an indicated value 50% above the share price.</li>\n<li>Ways to profit from secondary buys. A. The dividends are relatively high. B. The reinvested earnings are high relative to price paid and will affect the price. C. A bull market is most generous to lower priced issues. D. Smaller companies may be acquired by larger.</li>\n<li>The broadest category of investments for the enterprising investor are undervalued stocks of secondary issues. Invest in these only when they can be bought at 2/3 or less of indicated value.</li>\n<li>Market Fluctuations</li>\n<li>2 ways to profit from pendulum swings in the market A. Timing – anticipate the direction of the market and buy/sell accordingly (Very Difficult to do). B. Pricing – buying or selling when the stock are quoted above or below fair value. You may do dollar cost averaging when the market is fair value or undervalued to replicate this strategy.</li>\n<li>A less ambitious form of pricing is the simple effort that you do not pay too much for your stocks. This may work for the defensive investor who is planning on holding long term. You can dollar cost average during fair or low value markets.</li>\n<li>Bull Market Signs – Historically high price levels, high P/E ratios, low dividend yields against bond yields, speculation on margin, lots of public offerings of low quality stocks.</li>\n<li>The more successful a company, the more likely its price will fluctuate widely. Secondary issues will also fluctuate more widely than major ones.</li>\n<li>Never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell because it has gone down.</li>\n<li>The speculators primary interest lie in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor&#39;s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at good prices.</li>\n<li>Buy-Low Sell High – very difficult to do, so instead increase the proportion of bonds in your portfolio during bull markets and reduce the common stock element. Say 75B/25S during bull markets and 25B/75S during bear and 50/50 during fair value. This allows the investor to feel as if they are doing something and to prevent you from following the crowd.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/r4ojsl/benjamin_graham_the_intelligent_investor_book/","title":"Benjamin Graham The Intelligent Investor Book Summary","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-29T10:45:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-29 10:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r4ojsl","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/r4ojsl/benjamin_graham_the_intelligent_investor_book/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/r4ojsl/benjamin_graham_the_intelligent_investor_book/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"captmorgan50","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"captmorgan50","score":16,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ベンジャミン・グレアム「インテリジェント・インベスター」ブックサマリー","the_new_excerpt":"知的投資家\n\n * 投資運用とは、徹底した分析により、元本の安全と十分なリターンが\n   徹底した分析により、元本の安全性と十分なリターンが約束されるもの。それ以外のものは投機である。\n * 株式市場の動きに対する投機家の態度は、市場の変動を予測して利益を得ようとすることにある。\n   市場の変動を予測し、そこから利益を得ようとすることである。\n *...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"本杰明-格雷厄姆《聪明的投资者》一书摘要","the_new_excerpt":"聪明的投资者\n\n * 一项投资业务是在彻底分析后能保证本金安全和适当回报的业务。\n   本金的安全和足够的回报。其他都是投机。\n * 投机者对股票市场波动的态度在于试图\n   预测并从市场波动中获利。\n *...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"本傑明-格雷厄姆《聰明的投資者》一書摘要","the_new_excerpt":"聰明的投資者\n\n * 一項投資業務是在徹底分析後能保證本金安全和適當回報的業務。\n   本金的安全和足夠的回報。其他都是投機。\n * 投機者對股票市場波動的態度在於試圖\n   預測並從市場波動中獲利。\n *...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r4obfa","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r4obfa/good_luck_charm_for_monday_opening/","title":"Good luck charm for Monday opening","date":"November 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"月曜オープンのお守り","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"周一开幕的好运符","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"週一開幕的好運符","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-r4rvqm","excerpt":"If somehow this variant does turn out to be highly contagious but non-lethal\nthen this could be the beginning of the end of Covid.\n\nAssuming someone carrying Omicron antibodies is immune to the Delta strain, a\nnew non lethal strain taking over the world and replacing Delta would be the\nideal way to…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r4rvqm/omicron_could_cause_a_massive_bull_run/","title":"Omicron could cause a massive bull run","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 29, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":null}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-r4ojsl","previousId":"RedditPost-r4obfa","nextId":"RedditPost-r4rvqm","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/r4ojsl/benjamin_graham_the_intelligent_investor_book/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
