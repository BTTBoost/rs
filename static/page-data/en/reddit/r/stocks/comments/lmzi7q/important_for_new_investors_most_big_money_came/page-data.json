There are peaks and valleys. When you ask &quot;how does everyone get good deals?&quot; it&#39;s because they bought in 6 months ago and have held on since. There were times when there was a lot of green and sometimes when there was red (even more red than today). Unless you&#39;re pretty lucky, you will likely not buy something today and make a huge profit next week. Many/most of these plays are decisions people made awhile ago slowly coming to fruition (in a record bull-market no less).</p>\n\n<p>So, in the moment, all the red seems bad. But today doesn&#39;t matter unless you&#39;re buying or selling. What matters is months/years ahead. We&#39;re making decisions that will play out in May or August or 2023. That&#39;s where most of our minds need to be.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lmzi7q/important_for_new_investors_most_big_money_came/","title":"Important for New Investors: Most Big Money Came From Decisions Made Months/Years Ago","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-19T01:43:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-19 01:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c86cc965-46c3-5ec3-b808-6ea2a2f58dc6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmzi7q/important_for_new_investors_most_big_money_came/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmzi7q/important_for_new_investors_most_big_money_came/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"HonestlyDontKnow24","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HonestlyDontKnow24","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"HonestlyDontKnow24","score":417,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"对新投资者来说很重要。大多数大钱来自于几个月/几年前的决定","the_new_excerpt":"我也是一个新的投资者，但是我看到很多人都很恐慌，所有的。\n红，仿佛这很不寻常。\n\n如果你是因为WSB才在2月份开始的，那就花点时间看看吧。\n股票或指数的历史。有高峰也有低谷。当你问 \"如何\n每个人都能得到好的待遇？\"这...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對新投資者來說很重要。大多數大錢來自於幾個月/幾年前的決定","the_new_excerpt":"我也是一個新的投資者，但是我看到很多人都很恐慌，所有的。\n紅，彷彿這很不尋常。\n\n如果你是因爲WSB纔在2月份開始的，那就花點時間看看吧。\n股票或指數的歷史。有高峯也有低谷。當你問 \"如何\n每個人都能得到好的待遇？\"這...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a983e13b-721b-5ead-89bf-54fe9542ee4c","excerpt":"For example, ticker TAN was looking to break all time highs just a few days ago\nwith tons of positive moment.
