I figured I had money i was willing to risk using &lt;5% of my portfolio and I fortunately got in at $94 last Monday.</p>\n\n<p>I was seeing 3-4x gains throughout the week and I definitely got caught up in everyone else’s euphoria at WSB saying to diamond hand it to $1k. Looking back, I should have followed DFV’s footsteps last week and start locking in profits on the way up. While I’ve already learned years ago to not FOMO and buy high, I learned this week that unrealized gains are WORTHLESS and you shouldn’t hold the bag for too long. </p>\n\n<p>I still got out green and it was only &lt;5% of my portfolio. I know some people have it worse by putting in way more than they can afford to lose, but I didn’t realize how emotionally invested I would be and how bummed I would still feel for letting the crazy 3x gains slip away using. Unless the money was life changing, it wasn’t worth the emotional roller coaster IMO. </p>\n\n<p>Lessons I learned:\n-Lock in profits as soon as you start feeling euphoric from the gains</p>\n\n<p>-Don’t let other people influence your decisions </p>\n\n<p>-GET OUT once the hype train gets in</p>\n\n<p>If you guys have any other tips, please let me know!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","title":"Things I learned from last weeks chaos","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T19:07:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 19:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"52e3de4c-1b6e-53ac-be04-f89270520622","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/law5ka/things_i_learned_from_last_weeks_chaos/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"jabilas","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jabilas","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jabilas","score":209,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我从上周的混乱中学到的东西","the_new_excerpt":"我在过去的4年里一直在做美元成本平均法，我决定给它加点料。\n上周，我跳上了GME的火车。我想我有钱，我愿意\n冒着使用<5%的投资组合的风险，我很幸运地在上周一94美元进入。\n\n我看到整个星期有3-4倍的收益，我绝对...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我從上週的混亂中學到的東西","the_new_excerpt":"我在過去的4年裏一直在做美元成本平均法，我決定給它加點料。\n上週，我跳上了GME的火車。我想我有錢，我願意\n冒着使用<5%的投資組合的風險，我很幸運地在上週一94美元進入。\n\n我看到整個星期有3-4倍的收益，我絕對...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1356653863865114625","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1356653863865114625","title":"The I told you so's should not be going to the investors who bought GME in the past week but the charlatans and promoters who stoked the flames of outrage b/c they care more about social media clout than actually helping ppl\n\nAnd these hucksters all knew better","date":"February 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"我告诉过你的，不应该是过去一周买入GME的投资者，而是那些煽动愤怒火焰的骗子和促销员，因为他们更关心社交媒体的影响力，而不是真正帮助人们。\n\n而这些骗子们都知道","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"我告訴過你的，不應該是過去一週買入GME的投資者，而是那些煽動憤怒火焰的騙子和促銷員，因爲他們更關心社交媒體的影響力，而不是真正幫助人們。\n\n而這些騙子們都知道","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-eca2ace0-2838-52f7-8b54-6d5bf8bc6604","excerpt":"So, I bought GameStop towards the beginning of this whole debacle with 44 shares\nan average share price of about $250.
