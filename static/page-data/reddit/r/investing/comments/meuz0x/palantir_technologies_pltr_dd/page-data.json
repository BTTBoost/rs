In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.</p>\n\n<p>We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.</li>\n<li>Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.</li>\n<li>The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry.

Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep.
