This idea to me does not flow with the idea that most investors demand at least some type of safety or risk aversion with their investment choices. </p>\n\n<p>Lower interest rates, easy money, and simply no where else to put that money to gain a return, won&#39;t last forever. Sure, up until some given point (and that is the key) investors will flock to the only option available for returns. However, in my opinion, that level will slowly wane as the market rises along with the risk associated with it at these price levels. I don&#39;t believe investors will continue to put their money to work in a market that (at these price levels) only brings a higher level of risk with it. At some point money will stay on the sidelines. </p>\n\n<p>Low interest rates just might cut it as a qualifying reasoning for the current valuations, but they won&#39;t be the reasoning for a correction/recession if it occurs and stays. </p>\n\n<p>Low interest rates that fueled this IMO excessive market rally will eventually be named the cause of the eventual correction. At that point whether money on the sidelines flows in will be dependent upon the economic/stimulus conditions at the time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kz5o83/opinion_lower_interest_rates_wont_justify/","title":"(Opinion) Lower interest rates won't justify excessive valuations forever.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T17:42:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 17:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"effa3066-0b16-594a-93ad-8e3256c52615","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kz5o83/opinion_lower_interest_rates_wont_justify/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kz5o83/opinion_lower_interest_rates_wont_justify/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"superavg","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/superavg","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"superavg","score":173,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"观点）降息不会永远成为过度估值的理由。","the_new_excerpt":"我偏向于我们被高估的一面。\n\n似乎最近很多人对目前的市场价格给出的唯一理由就是\n是低利率。在我看来，这种想法并不符合这样的想法。\n大多数投资者要求至少有一定的安全性或风险规避与... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"觀點）降息不會永遠成爲過度估值的理由。","the_new_excerpt":"我偏向於我們被高估的一面。\n\n似乎最近很多人對目前的市場價格給出的唯一理由就是\n是低利率。在我看來，這種想法並不符合這樣的想法。\n大多數投資者要求至少有一定的安全性或風險規避與... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cab80dba-2a4f-5cba-811d-3c9be5bc431c","excerpt":"I'm sure that you all are aware of this phenomenon, it seems that whenever ARK\nfund manager Cathie Wood invests in something, the individual ticker will always\ntake off upon the release of daily trade notification reports.\n\nOne recent example would be PLTR - when PLTR was down about 2.27% on 14…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kz6x9s/ark_etfs_a_self_fulfilling_prophecy/","title":"ARK ETFs - A Self Fulfilling Prophecy?","date":"January 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ARK ETF--自我实现的预言？","the_new_excerpt":"相信大家都知道这个现象，似乎每当ARK\n基金经理凯西-伍德投资的东西，个人的股票永远是\n每天的交易通知报告发布后，就会有新的起色。\n\n最近的一个例子是PLTR--当PLTR在14日下跌约2.27%......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARK ETF--自我實現的預言？","the_new_excerpt":"相信大家都知道這個現象，似乎每當ARK\n基金經理凱西-伍德投資的東西，個人的股票永遠是\n每天的交易通知報告發布後，就會有新的起色。\n\n最近的一個例子是PLTR--當PLTR在14日下跌約2.27%......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-abece3eb-da81-54ec-9663-2631d99eefe7","excerpt":"OK RETARDS LISTEN UP.
