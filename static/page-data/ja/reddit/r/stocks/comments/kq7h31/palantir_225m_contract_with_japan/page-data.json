(NYSE:PLTR) announced today that on December 28, 2020, it was awarded a $22.5 million, one-year contract in partnership with SOMPO Holdings for the “Real Data Platform for Security, Health, and Wellbeing”. SOMPO’s visionary Real Data Platform, or “RDP” is a collaborative ecosystem between public and private sectors that will improve healthcare in Japan, streamline supply chains across industries, and increase security and resilience in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In November 2019, SOMPO and Palantir jointly established Palantir Technologies Japan K.K., a technology company that would provide Palantir’s platforms and services in Japan. Already, Palantir Japan has actively supported elder care transformation, with active work across dozens of facilities to make care plans more efficient and effective and improve facility operations.</p>\n\n<p>SOMPO’s RDP objectives will accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese commercial and governmental institutions, and create connected infrastructure across key industries. Japanese industries, ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing, have generated a tremendous amount of “real data” over the past few decades. For example, Japan alone has more than 60,000 elder care facilities, each generating real data from suppliers, facilities, care plans, training programs, and more. The RDP, with SOMPO at the forefront, will serve as the connected infrastructure for this and other industries, including logistics, transportation, research, and government agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Further updates on the RDP will be provided in a forthcoming joint press release between SOMPO and Palantir.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kq7h31/palantir_225m_contract_with_japan/","title":"Palantir $22.5M contract with Japan","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-04T13:52:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-04 13:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3dd0a7cc-1266-5799-9dff-94809cce0e47","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kq7h31/palantir_225m_contract_with_japan/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kq7h31/palantir_225m_contract_with_japan/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"infinity884422","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/infinity884422","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"infinity884422","score":1253,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Palantir与日本签订价值2250万美元的合同","the_new_excerpt":"链接\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Technologies-Expands-Japan-Business-with-New-22.5-Million-Contract/default.aspx]\n\n丹佛--(美国商业资讯)--Palantir Technologies Inc.(纽约证券交易所代码：PLTR)今天宣布\n2020年12月28日，它获得了2250万美元的一年期…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Palantir與日本簽訂價值2250萬美元的合同","the_new_excerpt":"鏈接\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Technologies-Expands-Japan-Business-with-New-22.5-Million-Contract/default.aspx]\n\n丹佛--(美國商業資訊)--Palantir Technologies Inc.(紐約證券交易所代碼：PLTR)今天宣佈\n2020年12月28日，它獲得了2250萬美元的一年期…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1345948368401555456","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1345948368401555456","title":"Top performing stocks in the Dow last year...\nApple: +82%\nMicrosoft: +43%\nNike: +41%\nSalesforce: +37%\nCaterpillar: +27%\n---\nBottom performers...\nBoeing: -34%\nWalgreens: -29%\nChevron: -26%\nIntel: -15%\nMerck: -7%\n---\n19 out of 30 positive.\n\nData: @ycharts https://t.co/OF9XIIMJ09","date":"January 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"去年道琼斯指数中表现最好的股票..。\n苹果：+82%\n微软：+43%\n耐克：+41%\nSalesforce：+37%\n卡特彼勒：+27%\n\n表现最差的..。\n波音：-34%\n沃尔格林：-29%\n雪佛龙：-26%\n英特尔：-15%\n默克：-7%\n\n30个阳性中有19个是阳性的。\n\n数据：@ycharts https://t.co/OF9XIIMJ09","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"去年道瓊斯指數中表現最好的股票..。\n蘋果：+82%\n微軟：+43%\n耐克：+41%\nSalesforce：+37%\n卡特彼勒：+27%\n\n表現最差的..。\n波音：-34%\n沃爾格林：-29%\n雪佛龍：-26%\n英特爾：-15%\n默克：-7%\n\n30個陽性中有19個是陽性的。\n\n數據：@ycharts https://t.co/OF9XIIMJ09","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-4715e4ac-1689-5733-bfaa-e0830d1fe628","excerpt":"Almost all “investing advice” are just get rich quick mania advice.
