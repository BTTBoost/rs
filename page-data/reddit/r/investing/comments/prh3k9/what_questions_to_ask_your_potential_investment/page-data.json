For some of you, it might make sense now or later down the road to consider pursuing an Investment Advisor/Financial Advisor.  I myself, work for a Boutique RIA firm as a portfolio manager, and am in no way soliciting my business, but instead, I put together a list of questions to use as a guide for the &quot;Interview Process&quot;.  Before I get into it, my recommendation if you choose to hire an Advisor, make sure they are a Fee-Only Fiduciary, this is usually the most transparent type of advisor out there.  This can protect you from being sold crappy investment products that put money in your advisors pocket that likely aren&#39;t best suited for you.</p>\n\n<p>1.       Tell me about your qualifications and experience? </p>\n\n<p>You NEED to know how long your advisor has been in the industry and what education and designations they have.  The CFP, CFA, and CPA are some of the most prestigious and well-recognized designations that an advisor can have.</p>\n\n<p>2.       What problems can you solve and what services do you provide?</p>\n\n<p>Financial advisors can perform a multitude of different functions, so finding the one that fits your needs and has the expertise you are looking for.  You want an advisor is isn’t just one-dimensional (i.e. only selling insurance products) but rather can offer many different types of advice like real estate, equities, alternatives, etc.</p>\n\n<p>3.       Who else stands to gain from the services you provide me?</p>\n\n<p>You want a clear understanding of any other third parties that aim to benefit off the services your potential advisor is giving you.  Advisors that sell a certain product, mutual fund, or policy typically have a pre-arranged relationship that usually comes in the form of compensation when providing these products.</p>\n\n<p>4.       Have you ever been professionally disciplined?</p>\n\n<p>FINRA, CFA, state agencies, and CFP boards keep records on the disciplinary history of candidates and advisors.  You should verify with these entities if your potential advisor has ever been reprimanded or professionally disciplined.</p>\n\n<p>5.       How secure are your services?</p>\n\n<p>Cybersecurity is a serious issue, so you want to make sure what systems your advising company has in place, how the information is store, what software partners they are working with, and ultimately how is your sensitive data being stored.  At the end of the day, the Financial Advisor is going to have a lot of your personal financial data, so you just want to make sure how secure it really is.</p>\n\n<p>6.       How much control do I have over decisions made?</p>\n\n<p>FAs have different scopes of ability and services.  Some have complete discretion and control over the account with no client input, while other FAs serve as more of an educator and the client does have a lot of input.  If you are looking for someone to make all the investment-management decisions for you, then find an advisor that can serve in that capacity.  If, on the other hand, you are more of a DIY type investor, find an advisor that can serve as a second set of eyes while still giving you the ability to pick what securities or investment vehicles to include in your portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>7.       How are you getting paid?</p>\n\n<p>For any reputable FA can answer this question.  There isn’t one right answer for the fee structure that is best for you, but you definitely want one of transparent.  There are so many types of fee structures, so try to understand how your FA actually gets paid.</p>\n\n<p>8.       Ask him or her to explain a concept to you</p>\n\n<p>This allows you an opportunity to see their ability to communicate effectively.  A large part of the financial planning process comes in the delivery of the plan itself.  Choosing an advisor who can not only develop a comprehensive financial plan but also deliver it in a way that is well understood.</p>\n\n<p>Below are five concept-oriented questions to consider asking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is passive vs. active investing?</li>\n<li>How do you determine how much of my money should be in stocks vs. bonds?</li>\n<li>What is a <a href=\"http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/investment/bonds/individual_bonds/bond_ladders\">laddered bond</a> portfolio?</li>\n<li>How do you determine how much money I can safely withdraw each year without running out?</li>\n<li>What do you think of <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/annuities-4074052\">annuities</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
