But I&#39;ve got a question on dividends. To me it doesn&#39;t really seem worth it to buy stocks purely for the dividends. Games WOrkshop ( a miniature company) lists its stocks at around £113, and its dividends are around £0.45 and they give it out 4 times a year. so thats only like £1.80 a year, it would take like 60 yrs to even break even with that. Even longer if you bought multiple shares. Wouldn&#39;t it just be better to keep the money and not buy the stock? Am I misunderstanding something important here? I&#39;ve used Games Workshop as an example since its a company I&#39;m familiar with and I understand the market far more than something like cars or pharmacuticals.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT : Thanks for these replies, I believe that I misunderstood stocks fundementaly and now know that dividends are mostly just the cherry on top.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o8akyg/are_dividends_worth_it/","title":"Are dividends worth it?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-26T17:04:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-26 17:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5c139e51-9a43-5529-a7f7-f6fdd61a1b05","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8akyg/are_dividends_worth_it/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8akyg/are_dividends_worth_it/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ButterLord12342","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ButterLord12342","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ButterLord12342","score":370,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"配当金は価値があるのか？","the_new_excerpt":"私は株を始めたばかりで、株の仕組みがよくわかりません。しかし、配当金についての質問があります。\n配当金についてです。私にとっては、純粋に配当金のためだけに株を買うのは、あまり価値がないように思えます。\n配当金です。ゲームショップ（ミニチュアの会社）は株式を約113ポンドで上場しています。\n配当金は約0.45ポンドで、4回に分けて出しています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"分红是否值得？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我是股票新手，并不太清楚它们是如何运作的。但我有一个问题\n关于分红的问题。对我来说，纯粹为了分红而购买股票似乎并不值得。\n红利。Games WOrkshop（一家微型公司）的股票价格约为1美元。\n113英镑，其股息约为0.45英镑，他们发放了4次。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"分紅是否值得？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我是股票新手，並不太清楚它們是如何運作的。但我有一個問題\n關於分紅的問題。對我來說，純粹爲了分紅而購買股票似乎並不值得。\n紅利。Games WOrkshop（一家微型公司）的股票價格約爲1美元。\n113英鎊，其股息約爲0.45英鎊，他們發放了4次。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1408544163881177094","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1408544163881177094","title":"Crude Oil closed above $74 a barrel for the first time since October 2018, up 91% in the last year. https://t.co/VrlLcYrgzo","date":"June 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"原油は2018年10月以来、初めて1バレル74ドルを超えて引け、昨年1年間で91％上昇 https://t.co/VrlLcYrgzo","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"原油自2018年10月以来首次收于每桶74美元以上，在过去一年中上涨91%。https://t.co/VrlLcYrgzo。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"原油自2018年10月以來首次收於每桶74美元以上，在過去一年中上漲91%。https://t.co/VrlLcYrgzo。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-96bfb862-ebd3-51bb-8060-56a69e09219b","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8bwa0/does_anyone_still_watch_saturday_morning_cartoons/","title":"Does anyone still watch Saturday morning cartoons?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 26, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今でも土曜朝のアニメを見ている人はいますか？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"还有人看星期六早上的动画片吗？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"還有人看星期六早上的動畫片嗎？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-5c139e51-9a43-5529-a7f7-f6fdd61a1b05","previousId":"TweetPost-1408544163881177094","nextId":"RedditPost-96bfb862-ebd3-51bb-8060-56a69e09219b","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o8akyg/are_dividends_worth_it/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
