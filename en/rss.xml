I am 21, and relatively new. I started around April of this year, but I&amp;amp;#39;ve been eyeing the stock market for a while, since I was 17, but since I didn&amp;amp;#39;t have a stable income stream, I couldn&amp;amp;#39;t invest until recently. I heard about meme stocks but as I knew I wanted to be an index investor. First I bought VOO then moved to VTI. I was a boglehead at heart and still am, more or less.  Also, when I say things such as &amp;amp;quot;This cannot happen&amp;amp;quot;, it really means &amp;amp;quot;In my opinion, this cannot happen.&amp;amp;quot; I figured it&amp;amp;#39;d be obvious from now on that this is mostly just my opinion. I&amp;amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;amp;#39;m 100% right, but I figured since it&amp;amp;#39;d be annoying to constantly repeat, &amp;amp;quot;this is my opinion&amp;amp;quot;, I&amp;amp;#39;d mention this nonetheless. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Since this is a Long post, if you&amp;amp;#39;d like, just see if you find your argument in bold, as I tried to go over the main counter-arguments for them.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I, like many others, have discovered LETFs, but people scare people away from truly investing in them while spouting the same repeated things, ad nauseum. I also have seen a lot of TQQQ posts recently, which.... lowkey brings up alarm bells. If history truly does repeat itself, people used the hell out of leverage and LETFs during the dot-com bubble and the 2008 crash.. With all the talk of the market being in a bubble (And for the record, when i mention &amp;amp;quot;the market&amp;amp;quot;, I strictly mean the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500, or VOO/SPY), then then yikes..? But nonetheless I haven&amp;amp;#39;t quite seen anything thoroughly in depth, which is what I strive to do with this post. So, if I succeeded, let me know at the end. I&amp;amp;#39;m not going to cut corners, as I&amp;amp;#39;ve mentioned in the title. This will be long, so get some snacks if you&amp;amp;#39;d like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyway, speaking of crashes, people often say stuff like:&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;What about Dot-Com crash and 2008? You&amp;amp;#39;d still be at a loss today from the dot-com crash if TQQQ existed back then!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1fmpmxW.png&quot;&amp;gt;True&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;... But, let&amp;amp;#39;s go over why one is not like the other: The dot-com bubble is not what TQQQ is currently. Some parts of the market, such as electric vehicle companies such as RIVN, TESLA, NKLA, meme stocks such as GME, AMC, or some penny stocks may be in a bubble, but the market as a whole is not in a bubble. It may head for a correction, but the whole reason why the Dot-Com Bubble popped was because the market was euphoric, with P/E ratios completely bonkers for the companies that are essentially garbage. Take this &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://images.thinkadvisor.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/415/2020/12/cape.jpg&quot;&amp;gt;chart&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; showcasing how absurdly high the Shiller P/E ratio around 2001 was. It&amp;amp;#39;s *still way higher* than even now, with companies that are much more profitable, mature, and robust than ever before. Instead of random companies that have never sold anything before (Ouch, I know RIVN exists y&amp;amp;#39;all.. I already said it&amp;amp;#39;s a bubble stock. But the market as a whole...? Not at all), you have companies like Apple, Amazon, FB/Meta, Microsoft, etc. I mean, I could go on and on about the amazing companies that are currently in the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500. While yes, people thought the same about things like Blockbuster, Nokia, Enron, these companies are at completely different stages in terms of profitability, maturity, and/or diversity in assets entirely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While, sure, anything can happen to, say, Apple -or even multiple companies- if you take &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;index investing seriously, and buy/hold, you will statistically always come out on top in the long run.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This is simply due to the fact that index investing in the broad market is diversified, and has great companies. It&amp;amp;#39;s so simple, yet so effective. On top of that, the risk that the majority of companies in the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 go bankrupt like in 2001 is just so insanely small, that if that were to be the case, something *terribly, terribly wrong* is happening to America, if not the entire world due to how globalized the companies in the index are. Trust me, if your boomer stocks such as KO, JNJ, and even stuff like Microsoft and Amazon go under, it doesn&amp;amp;#39;t matter what you invested in. Everything is on fire. This is essentially the idea of investing in the index in the first place. If you are able to worry about if the market is down, you don&amp;amp;#39;t have it bad enough, and it&amp;amp;#39;s going to be alright in the long term. This, combined with everything else I said, more or less ensures that investing into something like VOO/UPRO won&amp;amp;#39;t have such a gigantic crash such as before. As cliche as it may sound, *This time truly is different*... For this anyway. Besides, due to how LETF&amp;amp;#39;s are, I would argue it&amp;amp;#39;s actually better to *DCA* instead of Lump sum, or at least continue to DCA after a huge draw-down so the draw-up roars louder and harder. There&amp;amp;#39;s a difference between DCA into an LETF just like you would with VTI and just putting all 100k of your retirement at once into a market environment with a lot of companies that never have made any profitability at all when you&amp;amp;#39;re 2 years away from retirement&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;So, Okay, what about 2008 then?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hXj9RnA.png&quot;&amp;gt;Well...&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; It&amp;amp;#39;s not pretty. But that&amp;amp;#39;s entirely the point of LETF&amp;amp;#39;s. They amplify, and compound gains and losses. But you&amp;amp;#39;d still have recovered through a 90% drawdown in just... in 4-5 years. If you are able to stomach it, which you *should mentally expect and prepare for* during such a thing, and continue to DCA (which this only tests a lump sum), you essentially are loading up your weapons for the next bull market. And when the bull market comes, it roars loud and clear with LETF&amp;amp;#39;s. The thing people might think with LETF&amp;amp;#39;s is that they&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;amp;quot;beginner traps&amp;amp;quot;, or that &amp;amp;quot;they seem too good to be true&amp;amp;quot;. Really, they&amp;amp;#39;re &amp;amp;quot;risky&amp;amp;quot; extremely volatile. With a lot of things in investing, risk/reward is a big thing. For example, bonds are low-risk, low-reward typically. VTI is considered low-medium risk, low-medium reward. TQQQ/UPRO is high-risk/High-reward, and managing your risk is how you can mitigate the downs, should anything like it happen again. If you&amp;amp;#39;re able to handle 90%+ drawdowns, sure, you can have 90%+ rallies. In fact, though, 2008 is one of the big reasons why QE is such a huge influence in the market. It seems like &amp;amp;quot;The Fed&amp;amp;quot; will do whatever it can to save the market. So, while 2008 probably won&amp;amp;#39;t happen again, an event similar to it (such as 2020) may happen again. But it probably won&amp;amp;#39;t be as bad, last for as long, and may recover quicker.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;But what about Volatility Decay? If the price of $100 goes up 10%, then down $10, you lost money! It&amp;amp;#39;s simple math!&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Yeah? That is just simple math. I&amp;amp;#39;ve seen this repeated so many times as an argument against LETF&amp;amp;#39;s. It&amp;amp;#39;s not really an argument as the same goes for unleveraged ETF&amp;amp;#39;s such as VTI as well. Sure, while Index XYZ would be at 99, the 3x XYZ would be at 91. But, what exactly does that look like? &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.website-files.com/617960145ff34f911afe7243/617960145ff34f0fcdfe79eb_5ed6befa9e2f6d4f2c1095c7_pic-3.png&quot;&amp;gt;Well&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, it certainly looks very odd to say the least. I&amp;amp;#39;ve never had anybody bring up any real examples of decay eating away LETF&amp;amp;#39;s long term. Sure, *theoretically* if the market just goes up and down the exact same amount every single day forever then sure, but *theoretically* I can easily Mike Tyson in a fight if I just perfectly dodge every attack and never get hit. Realistically though, that will never happen. It&amp;amp;#39;s technically *possible*, but hypotheticals and theoreticals oftentimes have no place in reality. Sideways trading does happen quite a bit on a day-to-day scale, but there&amp;amp;#39;s quite a few days/months that on average in the stock market where they account for a good chunk of gains. This is why the saying, &amp;amp;quot;Time in the market beats timing the market&amp;amp;quot;, because if you do somehow get in at the perfect time, you could have missed out some really, really, REALLY great days that would have still made you go up regardless.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;What about if the market drops 34% in a day?! You lose everything&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Yes/No. Yes, theoretically/hypothetically, the math tells you you would. But realistically there are circuit breakers on basically everything. From futures, to the market, to whatever else you can think of, there are circuit breakers that stop trading so that at any point, a drawdown of such a magnitude is next to impossible at all. As far as I know, historically, such a thing has never happened. There have been some pretty nasty drawdowns, but nothing of that magnitude. Furthermore, you need to ask yourself a simple question: If we&amp;amp;#39;ve had such a crazy bull market, why haven&amp;amp;#39;t inverse LETF&amp;amp;#39;s just went tits up? Surely the math would point to them fizzling out right? I mean, take SQQQ, a 3x inverse of QQQ. But in the real world scenarios, with real world people, these LETF&amp;amp;#39;s are actively managed, which means they&amp;amp;#39;ll do whatever they can to keep it afloat. For example, SQQQ does reverse splits keep it alive. While SQQQ has basically killed all your money if you bought it and held, that&amp;amp;#39;s the same for most inverse ETF&amp;amp;#39;s. It doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have anything to do with leverage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;So, what about a prolonged bear market such as the Great Depression??&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
So, I don&amp;amp;#39;t mean to pull the &amp;amp;quot;ThIs TiMe Is DiFFeReNT&amp;amp;quot; shlick, but truthfully, comparing 1920s america to 2020&amp;amp;#39;s america is like comparing modern cars to 1920&amp;amp;#39;s cars. Sure they both drive but they&amp;amp;#39;re entirely different beasts. Oftentimes, it&amp;amp;#39;s better to bring up averages, rather than extremes, as extremes are usually outliers. Even if they are possible, they&amp;amp;#39;re rarely ever going to happen. Again, This is why something such as 2008 is a better argument against LETF&amp;amp;#39;s than say, the dot-com bubble, but even then, 2008 eventually recovered. Combine those things, plus the willingness of The Fed to just woosh in and save the market, it&amp;amp;#39;s very unlikely such an event will happen again. One important fact to remember is that, on average:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The average length of a Bull/Bear market is 2.7 years and 9.6 months respectively&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This is the whole crux as to why holding something such as VTI/VOO wins long term. You simply have more up days than down days, on average. If you truly are a believer in the sentiment that bull markets will last longer and that the market will continue to be profitable, while bear markets will be significantly shorter, it&amp;amp;#39;s a no-brainer to invest in VTI/VOO, just like it is to invest in TQQQ, once you learn the risks and differences of leveraged ETF&amp;amp;#39;s compared to regular ETF&amp;amp;#39;s. This also brings me back to my next point:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;If you followed Benjamin Graham&amp;amp;#39;s book on the Intelligent Investor, &amp;amp;quot;Mr. Market&amp;amp;quot; is described as irrational and too optimistic or pessimistic.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
Along with creating the fundamental investing advice, and being labelled as &amp;amp;quot;probably the most important and influential value investing book ever written&amp;amp;quot; by Warren Buffet himself, Graham describes Mr Market as an analogy for market sentiment. Use this to your advantage. On any bad news about something, the market, instead of being perfectly &amp;amp;quot;efficient&amp;amp;quot;, will be incredibly &amp;amp;quot;bipolar&amp;amp;quot;, swinging from one pendulum of extreme, either being optimistic or pessimistic. This means when the market dips, it will dip *hard*, and when it rallies, it will rally *high*. You can clearly see this currently with the current bull market. People complain that it&amp;amp;#39;s too high, or a bubble. Really, that&amp;amp;#39;s just the market sentiment. No wonder it&amp;amp;#39;s extreme. It&amp;amp;#39;s purely the collective emotion of greed compared to fear. Not &amp;amp;quot;pure raw logic and wits and math and calculations&amp;amp;quot;. The saying goes, &amp;amp;quot;be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful&amp;amp;quot;, not &amp;amp;quot;be robotic and logical&amp;amp;quot;. Another great saying is &amp;amp;quot;The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent&amp;amp;quot;. Truth is, the market is irrational. Extremely so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With all this being said, these were most of the argument&amp;amp;#39;s I&amp;amp;#39;ve heard against LETF&amp;amp;#39;s. LETF&amp;amp;#39;s are all about risk-management. For example, when I brought up someone who is buying 100k worth of TQQQ in 2001 two years before retirement, that&amp;amp;#39;s for a reason. Due to me being 21, and somewhat little to somewhat moderate cash invested into TQQQ, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;due to it being leveraged, even a small amount can turn into a large sum.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; For example, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;if you invested 5k in 2010, reinvesting your little dividends you earn from TQQQ, you&amp;amp;#39;d have over 400k today.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; This is the power of leverage in great companies. with as little as 5k you can &amp;amp;quot;gamble&amp;amp;quot;, if you really think it&amp;amp;#39;s a gamble. Personally, I think a gamble is 5k in GME right now. Investing into the top companies in the nasdaq, leveraged or not, is way less of a gamble, if at all. Having a long time horizon especially helps, which for high/risk high/reward plays, is definitely an advantage. This is why I would not recommend someone who is two years from retirement to put money they need into leveraged funds. They are inherently, amplified in volatility. Entering at the wrong time, and not having enough time to DCA back in can be devastating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;If, however, you need a hedge due to your risk tolerance, or having a large sum into TQQQ, you can use 55% TQQQ/UPRO / 45% TMF&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
This is also another thing I rarely see mentioned. It&amp;amp;#39;s more mentioned from people using TQQQ/UPRO or other LETF&amp;amp;#39;s, but people act like you just go 100% into TQQQ without a hedge and call it a day. Realistically, you can do so much with portfolios. For simplicity sake, TMF, a 3x bonds index, hedges great with TQQQ/UPRO, due to being *uncorrelated* in most timeframes. For example, when people get scared of something such as say.. I don&amp;amp;#39;t know.....? A new Covid Variant called the Omicron, they flock to save bets such as bonds. This means that as TQQQ goes down, TMF will go up. You can actually see it clear as day during last Friday, and especially other days as well. While TQQQ took a beating, TQQQ/TMF was actually up. While, sure, pure 100% TQQQ beats TQQQ/TMF, but if you can&amp;amp;#39;t handle the drawdowns or need a hedge, it&amp;amp;#39;s well, well worth it. This strategy is called &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;HedgeFundies Excellent Adventure,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;or&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;HFEA&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; for short. I won&amp;amp;#39;t go over it much due to it being exhaustively gone over, but on the bogleheads site, there&amp;amp;#39;s a thread for it already, which you can take a look at them here, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=288192&quot;&amp;gt;Part I&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=288192&quot;&amp;gt;Part II&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, In short, why I&amp;amp;#39;m 100% investing in TQQQ and soon to hedge with TMF once I reach a sizable sum is simply for multiple reasons. I disagree with plenty of the arguments I&amp;amp;#39;ve heard about LETF&amp;amp;#39;s, I&amp;amp;#39;m 21, have a long time horizon, and I&amp;amp;#39;m willing to take risks such as leverage in ETF&amp;amp;#39;s to turn a small sum such as 5k, 10k, or 15k into something hopefully huge later down the line. Then once I finally hit a good amount, if I ever do, I&amp;amp;#39;ll then invest back into VTI/VOO and let the dividends compound more than I ever could DCA into. Truth be told, even I&amp;amp;#39;m terrified of holding 500k worth of TQQQ, *maybe* even with a hedge. That&amp;amp;#39;s the short of it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There&amp;amp;#39;s also nothing stopping someone from just going 10% TQQQ as well. Even though the prospectus of every LETF says not to buy/hold as they&amp;amp;#39;re only for daily leveraged returns, nobody is stopping you from holding it and seeing what happens. Some people just want to take it farther than others, myself included.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

In the past I have been a complete idiot with financial matters. Recently my dad passed away and left us a considerable sum. My wife is pretty adamant she wants an advisor and looking at my past financial mistakes I agree with her. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So I went out and researched like crazy. We met with a friend&amp;amp;#39;s trusted 1% Aum guy, a Vanguard PAS guy and an advice-only guy. I liked the AUM guy and his advice but I think Bogleheads has turned me sour on AUM. Plus the AUM guy wanted everything at his brokerage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We initially liked the advice-only guy because he was cheaper and I thought he help me get my feet underneath me for DIY down the road. We could set everything up wherever we want. I also liked him because he set us up on their version of Mint to track all our spending. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But he constantly hmmed and hawed on allocation. We had our 2nd meeting today and for an hour and a half he talked about getting a new credit card and retirement goals and tasks and ... I finally jumped in and said if you had to invest my dad&amp;amp;#39;s money what funds in the market tomorrow and what allocation would he recommend? He pulls up his website and hits an 70/30 Risk button - hits another button and boom pops out an 11 fund portfolio. I ask him what&amp;amp;#39;s the software they&amp;amp;#39;re using and he talks about low cost ratios. I asked him if they&amp;amp;#39;re licensing a robo-advisor of some kind and he kind of yada yada&amp;amp;#39;d that one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0tddsua71n281.png?width=920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b10ab2c9e458779ecc41a882376843dc097f360a&quot;&amp;gt;https://preview.redd.it/0tddsua71n281.png?width=920&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b10ab2c9e458779ecc41a882376843dc097f360a&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I got kind of mad that it took him this long to throw out how he delivers allocation advice. I&amp;amp;#39;ve been looking at 3 and 4 fund Vanguard and Fidelity portfolios and told him that&amp;amp;#39;s what I wanted. Then my wife got mad. &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;amp;#39;m so tired of hearing about Boogle Heads,&amp;amp;quot; she says. She&amp;amp;#39;s like &amp;amp;quot;what&amp;amp;#39;s wrong with this?&amp;amp;quot; - and I just shut up. I really don&amp;amp;#39;t know what I&amp;amp;#39;m doing I&amp;amp;#39;m just a guy that reads a forum who&amp;amp;#39;s messed up pretty bad in the past. Bogleheads is tough when you don&amp;amp;#39;t have a clue what you&amp;amp;#39;re doing but yet know you want something super simple but can&amp;amp;#39;t explain why that&amp;amp;#39;s better. I can&amp;amp;#39;t explain why VTI/VXUS/BND is better than this. Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;s not all that better? Maybe this is a perfectly fine portfolio?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He also said he wants to DCA this and not lump sum. So my question is - say I go along with this in a Fidelity account. How hard would it be to convert this into a VTI/VXUS/BND down the road?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the clock stuck midnight on Nov. 29, tickets for “Spider-Man: No Way Home” went on sale. Within minutes domestic movie ticket sites began to crash as moviegoers rushed to snag seats for one of the most anticipated films of the year.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is something that the box office has not experienced since the pandemic began and a sign that with the right releases, the movie theater industry has a “bright future,” experts say.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The pandemic battered cinemas, crushing demand and nearly bankrupting some of the industry’s largest exhibitors. The box office has been slow to rebound, but sustained momentum over the last six months has provided confidence in an eventual recovery.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Overnight, the latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a co-production between &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS&quot;&amp;gt;Disney&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP&quot;&amp;gt;Sony&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, has sparked even more optimism. Ticketing sites like Atom Tickets, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA&quot;&amp;gt;Fandango&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and MovieTickets.com alongside movie theater sites like &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMC&quot;&amp;gt;AMC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CNK&quot;&amp;gt;Cinemark&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and Regal saw a surge of demand for tickets leading many to crash or place visitors in hour-long online queues.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“There are different tiers of intense fan demand when it comes to box office pre-sales, and this film is clearly showing it belongs near the top with a select few others,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “For anyone who doubted the communal draw of the theatrical experience over the past two years, look to this enthusiasm for ‘Spider-Man’ as a major inflection point during the box office recovery period and the sign of a bright future ahead.”  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This kind of fervor has not been seen at the box office since 2019 when advanced tickets for titles like “Avengers: Endgame” and “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” went on sale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Following an extremely volatile, holiday-shortened week, stocks rebounded on Monday, driven higher by a huge bounce in technology, as market participants grapple with the potential implications of the newly discovered “Omicron” coronavirus variant. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed higher after its worst day since October 2020, as the price of oil, which suffered its worst day all year, somewhat rebounded. While it is way too early to make any conclusions, I am personally looking at this dip as a potential buying opportunity in equities that were overstretched before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients, “Ultimately this is not the first or last variant scare and our tech playbook over the last 18 months has been to use these macro/risk-off events as buying opportunities to own the tech sector specifically cloud, cyber-security, and 5G winners. While we are seeing a return to normalcy, a semi-remote workforce environment we believe is here to stay which underscores our tech cloud thesis into 2022 that the digital transformation build-out will be accelerated and is not a one time COVID pull forward event&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US and EU have banned a host of destinations to ban flights from several African countries after the new variant was discovered. But cases of the variant, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far designated as a &amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529&quot;&amp;gt;variant of concern&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern),&amp;amp;quot; have also detected in regions including the U.K., Hong Kong, Australia, Germany and Italy, among others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While there is still much that needs to be studies regarding the Omicron variant, Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), the two largest producers the current COVID vaccine, asid they are already working to adapt current inoculations for the new variant and that, if a tailor made vaccine is necessary, would be completed relatively quickly. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/moderna-says-an-omicron-variant-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-early-2022.html&quot;&amp;gt;Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said a new vaccine to address the Omnicron variant &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;would be widely available in early 2022 and &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omicron-covid-19-variant-pfizer-184458407.html&quot;&amp;gt;Pfizer said it could take about 100 days to have a tailor made vaccine ready to be widely available.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;President Biden said of the new variant, “his variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic. We have the best vaccines in the world, the best medicine, the best scientists, and we’re learning more every single day. We have more tools today to fight the variant than we ever have before.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Despite concerns present in the market, consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, continues accelerating. While supply-chain disruptions could lead shoppers toward in-stock items at physical stores this year, I think overall spending will see a healthy increase. The National Retail Federation (NRF) is forecasting an 8.5%-10.5% increase in holiday sales this year, compared with 2020. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The latest reading shows the personal savings rate is 7.5% (savings as a % of disposable income), the third-highest rate coming into Thanksgiving in the last quarter century. While this is down dramatically from the spike during the pandemic lockdowns (when consumers were unable to consume), the savings rate remains notably above the long-term average of 6.5% (6.1% excluding 2020). We think elevated savings will be drawn down, representing additional dry powder that will power consumer-spending growth for an extended period. At 4.2%, wage growth is now the highest it&amp;amp;#39;s been since Thanksgiving of 2007, providing additional fuel for consumers. Looking back over the last 25 years, when wage growth was above 4% and accelerating, GDP growth averaged 3.2%, compared with an average of 2.5% over the entire period, according to a report by Edward Jones. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Highlights&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Chief Executive Satya Nadella sold about half of his shares in the company last week, according to a federal securities filing. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001513142/000106299321011647/xslF345X03/form4.xml?campaign_id=4&amp;amp;amp;emc=edit_dk_20211129&amp;amp;amp;instance_id=46511&amp;amp;amp;nl=dealbook&amp;amp;amp;regi_id=90401093&amp;amp;amp;segment_id=75585&amp;amp;amp;te=1&amp;amp;amp;user_id=b1b6731f732a5b8d7bb632a925fe64b9&quot;&amp;gt;In the filing last week&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Redmond, Wash.-based software company reported Mr. Nadella sold 838,584 shares over two days, down from close to 1.7 million shares.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Jack Dorsey announced he will be stepping down as CEO of social media Twitter (TWTR), giving the lead role to Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal. In my opinion, this is good news for Twitter, given they will now have more focused leadership. Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Square (SQ) has a lot on his plate.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nissan Motors announced it was planning to spend $18 billion over five years to accelerate growth of their EVs.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Shares of Alibaba (BABA) stock fell to its lowest level in four years amid the continued regulatory push by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tencent (TCEHY) will further open their super-app WeChat, with over 1.2 billion users in China, and allow links to external shopping sites like Alibaba. This was a new regulation instituted by the CCP in order to encourage competition among the big tech firms. Previously, apps in China did not allow competitor links in their platforms.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Russia will continue slowing down the speed of Twitter on mobile devices until all content deemed illegal is deleted, state communications regulator&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Please note price target upgrades were written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

That´s my second analysis for AAPL, the last one was from May. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around &lt;strong&gt;50%&lt;/strong&gt; of their sales comes from the &lt;strong&gt;iPhone&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Mac&lt;/strong&gt; makes up around &lt;strong&gt;11%&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;iPad&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;9%&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;19%&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Wearables, Home and Accessories&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;11%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the valuation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take &lt;strong&gt;analyst estimates&lt;/strong&gt;, we discount that by our &lt;strong&gt;required return of 8%&lt;/strong&gt;. Then we use the &lt;strong&gt;perpetual growth rate of 2,5%&lt;/strong&gt; and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of &lt;strong&gt;$99 per share&lt;/strong&gt;. But because we have to account for &lt;strong&gt;Apple´s debt&lt;/strong&gt; as well, our &lt;strong&gt;fair value of equity&lt;/strong&gt; would be &lt;strong&gt;$94 per share&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Apple´s price being at &lt;strong&gt;$160&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;per share&lt;/strong&gt; right now, it´s a little too high. That´s why I don´t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years.&lt;/strong&gt; We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the &lt;strong&gt;Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Estimated Growth Rate&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Future P/E Value&lt;/strong&gt;. With this method I get a stock price of &lt;strong&gt;$293 per share&lt;/strong&gt; which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That´s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I´ll do.&lt;/strong&gt; I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to &lt;strong&gt;dollar-cost-average&lt;/strong&gt;. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don´t double in 5 years, I´m rather bullish on this company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the 1 month chart and it&amp;#39;s been a steady drop since these 2 articles happened. Very frustrating as I went all in on small caps and they are easily my biggest losers especially on a day like today with the market super up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company IMHO is so undervalued at this price and has much room to go up, HIMX had strong revenue and earnings growth in the last 4 quarters, but the stock price did not act accordingly, and I believe this growth will continue due to chip shortage, and the transformation in the global economy to electric cars, in 2030 most of the big cars brands are expected to stop producing diesel cars and produce only electric cars, this is regardless the already existed electric cars brands like Xpeng, Nio, Tesla etc. this will cause constant demand on chips and more production and revenue for HIMX and other semiconductor stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/u5g0jy7vvk281.png?width=485&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=12c95a4227644109ca4be596b4ce38d3a91b3ff1&quot;&gt;HIMX Revenue and Earnings over the last 4 quarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below a comparison between AMD and HIMX performance for the last 4 quarters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.HIMX Revenue growth ................  AMD Revenue growth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q4 2020 $276M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15%&lt;/strong&gt; ----- Q4 2020 $3.24B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q1 2021 $309M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt; ------ Q1 2021 $3.45B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +7%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q2 2021 $365M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +18%&lt;/strong&gt; ------- Q2 2021 $3.85B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q3 2021 $421M &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +15% -------&lt;/strong&gt; Q3 2021 $4.31B &lt;strong&gt;QoQ +12%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;....................HIMX...........AMD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price to Earnings ............ 5.35 .................... 49.23&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price to Sales  ..................1.29  ....................12.76&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book value per share .....$4.17!! 🤯  ...........$5.89!! 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current ratio  ...................2.01 ...................... 2.24&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD is definitely bigger name than HIMX but I used this comparison just to show how HIMX is growing on the same pace as AMD, how it has healthy statistics, and how cheap its valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO HIMX is a solid play and a bargain at this price, the only thing that is holding back the stock price is the possible conflict between China and Taiwan, but if that happens, all the market will tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conservative prediction is that One year from now assuming normal market conditions HIMX price will be at least $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also 15% short interest add some spice to the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my last word is, see you on the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌙 🌙 🌙&lt;/p&gt;

The discovery of the variant resulted in one of the worst Black Friday trading sessions in recent memory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.98%, the S&amp;amp;P 500 index SPX, 1.62% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 2.08% all tumbling by at least 2%, but Ackman’s comments suggest that investors’ knee-jerk response may have been an overreaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond yields on Friday also fell as prices for government debt saw a rush to the perceived safety of Treasurys on the back of fresh concerns about new restrictions that could result from a strain of COVID that the World Health Organization on Friday designated a variant of concern. However, stocks were bouncing back on Monday and the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.528% was up 8 basis points at 1.56%. Prices for Treasurys fall as yields rise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, is known for his lucrative COVID wager. The Financial Times reported back in 2020 that the investor cashed out on bet that netted him a $2.6 billion profit on a $27 million at risk, on the premise that insurance premiums would soar during the height of the 2020 COVID pandemic as economies locked down. He also later in 2020 said that he placed bearish bets on corporate credit on the day that Pfizer PFE, -0.64%  and BioNTech BNTX, 3.65% released positive trial data on their COVID-19 vaccine, which triggered a whipsaw rally in stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ackman was wagering that the vaccines would lead to mask-wearing complacency. However, that bet presumably turned out wrong as markets continued to surge in the aftermath of those vaccines. The danger posed by the omicron variant isn’t yet fully understood, even though governments in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas immediately restricted travel from southern Africa. Vaccine manufacturers have said that they are examining the variant closely and note that the current batch of remedies might still prove effective against the strain and new vaccines could be readied in early 2022 if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Take bigger risks when you are young. When you are in your 20’s its fine to go heavy in high risk/high reward stocks. But this is flawed reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is taking big risks when you are young is more risky because of opportunity costs. People always mention compounding interest over decades. But fail to apply this to investing in risky stocks when you are young. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say you are 20 years old and you have $10k to invest. Its common to hear people say you can be more risky since you are so young. And even if you do YOLO and lose it all you can easily recover. But think opportunity cost. What did you really lose doing a YOLO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$10,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invest in an index fund that returns 8.5% annualized return &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Withdraw at 65 years old&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That $10k becomes $400k. So you basically lost $400k because you YOLOed on a risky stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hold till 70 you lost $600k. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 90 you can give your children and grandchildren $3.2 million. Or you could have fun and lose it all on a risky stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is a young persons greatest asset is TIME. Throwing investment time away by taking unnecessary risk is a massive mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying don’t buy stocks that are risky hyper growth companies. But also don’t gamble needlessly. Because you are gambling much more than that couple hundred or thousand you see next to the stock ticker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts have long predicted Amazon would overtake carriers like UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service, thanks to its increasingly in-house network of planes, trucks, vans and ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a positive development as Amazon dependence on other carriers will be lessen. The logistic and warehouse networks are in a optimal mode now as Amazon has been invested heavily to fight off the competition. This proves that the investment cycle has finally paid off as patience investors will be holding the amazon stocks and waiting for the next stock appreciation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sofi &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own Tesla because.... It is Tesla. People in my honest opinion want to believe they will only be making vehicles in the future. Not the case if Elon Musk gets his way (check out the Tesla bot for example, not to mention space travel, etc). Before today held 2 shares of Tesla, plan on buying 2 more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is a good long term buy and hold because it is Apple of course. I do not believe the Apple car that should be releasing in the next 3 years has been priced in to the stock at all yet. I could see Apple being worth over $500/share say 3 years from now. Before today held 14 shares of Apple, plan on buying 10 more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sofi is an underdog stock. I could see this stock going much further down, possibly to/below $10 a share again. Sofi is by definition loosing money, and it is the outlier compared to say a Tesla or an Apple stock... However I see it as being revolutionary when it comes to financial products for the everyday person. As a millennial most of my friends from around the United States seem to know more about Sofi than Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, etc. I would be shocked if Sofi is not worth $40 a share this time next year. Before today held 48 shares, will be buying 25 more today, and will wait for a potential dip below $12 - if that happens will buy as many shares as I can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me if I am missing anything with these stocks, and for us readers in similar situations, maybe a few stocks to consider purchasing in lieu of any of the above 3?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO and Coronavirus experts around the world are calling this morning for countries to drop travel restrictions and end the mass hysteria and instead be cautiously optimistic as initial reports out of South Africa suggest the new Omicron variant is not more lethal than the previous Delta variant. In fact, there have been no reports of hospitalisations or deaths as a result of anyone being diagnosed with Omicron. Most patients merely experience a severe headache, nausea, dizziness and a high pulse rate, according to hospitals and medics across Southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the news of the new variant, first reported in South Africa, led to mass hysteria around the world: markets thumbed and dozens of countries imposed travel restrictions and additional checks, including the UK, US, EU, Israel, Australia and Japan after the new mutation popped up in the UK, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic and Israel among other countries. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said this reaction was “medically seen, not justified.” A GP for over three decades, and chair of the South African Medical Association, she was the first African doctor to suggest to local authorities Covid had mutated into a new strain. Coetzee called the response from many European countries, including the UK, “just a hype.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s health minister Joe Phaahla also said the majority of cases of Omicron seen by doctors in his country have been “mild”. He added he has heard from GPs that the “majority of the people they’ve been seeing are mild.” “Our clinicians have not witnessed severe illness. Part of it may be because the majority of those who are positive are young people,” Dr Paahla added.&lt;/p&gt;

In my opinion, the biggest hurdle to the company&amp;#39;s trading performance is due to the Canadian adult recreational industry wide challenge along with covid-related retail headwinds. There&amp;#39;s been struggles for the Canadian cannabis LPs to generate growth organically within the adult recreational segment. For example, while Tilray, market leader in Canadian adult recreational, generated 26% topline growth from $405 million in 2020 to $513 million in 2021, much of that topline growth is derived from acquisitions. In other words, Tilray&amp;#39;s recent revenue growth were &amp;quot;bought&amp;quot; instead of generated organically as the market expands. Low growth within the segment along with some structural challenges and covid-related shut-downs further negatively impacted the industry&amp;#39;s outlook and profitability, resulting in depressing trading performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cannabis companies remain illegal in the United States at a federal level and debt capital raising are off the table as a result, Canadian cannabis LPs relies on equity issuance to fund acquisition opportunities to &amp;quot;grow&amp;quot; their toplines. Result of both stagnant growth and share dilution, Tilray traded down from $40 in February 2021 to $10 last close. Tilray&amp;#39;s TTM EV/Sales declined from 40x to 10x. For a growth company within a quickly expanding market that&amp;#39;s only 3 years old, 10x TTM sales EV is a good price in my opinion. What makes it even more attractive is that there&amp;#39;s a catalyst that the market has dismissed and forgotten that will completely derail the stagnant market growth narrative for Tilray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany&amp;#39;s new coalition government has recently reached a deal that&amp;#39;s set to legalize recreational cannabis use. As a result, German pot stocks popped last week on Frankfurt exchange. For example, German cannabis company Synbiotic rose by 33% to $29 Euro, which implies a $100mm market cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the market has forgotten however is that Canadian cannabis LP Tilray is actually the market leader in the Germany&amp;#39;s cannabis market. But the stock didn&amp;#39;t move last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I know the market made a mistake instead of &amp;quot;everything has been priced in&amp;quot; narrative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy. First, almost every German pot companies moved up last week. The fact that Tilray didn&amp;#39;t change at all suggests that whoever was making market genuinely forgot that Tilray is a market leader in the German cannabis market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if we assume status quo on Tilray&amp;#39;s 10x EV/Sales multiple, which is a very conservative assumption because we&amp;#39;re completely dismissing the potential of a new, 3-days old, 83 million population addressable market. And if we proxy $90 million of additional revenue, which is another very conservative assumption as Tilray generated $90 million in revenue after Canada legalized their adult recreational cannabis market in 2018; Conservative because German population doubles of Canadian. With the conservative multiple assumption while holding other variables constant, just by adding the additional $90 million in revenue, we should expect Tilray trade up by at least 30%. The fact that it didn&amp;#39;t trade up at the slightest suggests whoever was making market was sleeping in his office after he had his turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Tilray is production and distribution ready. Tilray operates two state-of-art facilities in Portugal and Germany with over 3 million square feet of production capacity. Tilray also owns and operates one of the largest market cap pharmaceutical company, CC Pharma, in Germany. Because of the company&amp;#39;s production and distribution capacity, institutional support, larger balance sheet, domestic moms &amp;amp; pops cannabis producers in Germany aren&amp;#39;t like to able to compete against Tilray in the immediate 24 months of legalization, allowing Tilray to secure market leadership. Again, this echoes with why assume only $90 million of revenue and 10x EV/Sales is a very conservative estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forth, there has been consistencies showing that the cannabis MTM is very inefficient. Most of you are aware that there were a squeeze with the Canadian cannabis LPs that took place in February. It was driven by Democrats winning the election, investors bet in favour that recreational cannabis use will be legalized in the U.S. It was similar to what&amp;#39;s happening today; similar but different. What&amp;#39;s similar is that both are political driven catalyst and market has gotten it completely wrong. Different was that last time Tilray were traded up for the wrong reason, Tilray has minimal operations in the United States, while they&amp;#39;re already a market leader in the German cannabis market with operations and infrastructures that are unmatched by their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, let me know if I got it wrong. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Position: 500 shares long TLRY at C$13.32&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Invest in companies, not the stock market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore short term movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting the economy is futile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting the short term movement of the stock market is futile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long term stocks have outperformed bonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average person is exposed to local companies years before wall street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the stock market, one in the hand is worth 10 in the bush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Any idiot can run this business&amp;quot; is one characteristic of the perfect company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in companies that make products people need to keep buying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the company insiders are buying, you should too. Management normally sells 2.3 shares for every 1 share they buy. In 1987 after the crash, it was 4 buys for 1 sell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry, any stock being touted as the next X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A share of stock is NOT a lotto ticket. It is a part ownership of a business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E ratio can be thought of as the number of years to earn back your original investment. IE = P/E of 10 would be 10 years assuming earnings stay constant. Ratios tend to be lower for slow growers and highest for the fast growers with cyclicals in between depending on the current cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at average P/E ratios on the company you are researching and peers going back several years to determine if it is a good buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid stocks with HIGH P/E ratios. They must have incredible earnings growth to justify the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E ratio that is half the growth rate (annual earnings) is very positive and one that is twice the growth rate is very negative. IE = P/E of 10 should be growing at 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formula = Growth rate plus dividend yield divided by P/E. IE = 12% growth + 3% yield/10 P/E = 1.5. Less than 1 is bad. 1.5 is ok and 2+ is great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market as a whole has its own collective P/E ratio, which is a good indicator of weather the market at large is over or under valued. If some stocks are selling at inflated prices relative to earnings, then it could be likely most stocks are selling at inflated prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest rates have a large effect on p/e ratios as investors pay higher p/e when interest rates are lower and bonds less attractive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend paying stocks keep the stock price from falling as far as if there was no dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You CAN&amp;#39;T predict future earnings. Wall Street has battalions of analysts trying to do this and they are wrong a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cash Flow – amount of money a company takes in as a result of doing business. You want to buy companies that don&amp;#39;t need to spend a lot of money to make money IE = company spends 20 million to make 100 million is better than one that needs to spend 90 million to make 100 million. Formula = $20 stock with $2 per share annual cash flow has a 10-1 ratio which is standard (10%). $20 stock with $4 CF = 20% return on cash. Focus on free cash flow – what is left over after normal capital spending is taken out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debt to equity ratio - normal is 25% debt to 75% equity but higher equity % is better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
