The final stop here is Facebook&amp;#39;s social manipulation algorithms become fully self aware, lock us in the metaverse forever, and then start using as human batteries for the purpose of dark and soulless machinations no organic mind can hope to understand, Matrix style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are driverless buses operating on specific routes as far and wide as Spain, Australia and China already - the routes extensive in China.  WeRide is offering Level 4   cargo deliveries in China.  It also offers Robo-taxis along with several other firms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eetasia.com/chinas-robotaxis-hit-the-road/&quot;&gt;https://www.eetasia.com/chinas-robotaxis-hit-the-road/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the media, analyst and investor hype over Tesla&amp;#39;s self-driving possibilities continue,  other companies continue to actually already deploy real robo-taxis, even in major US cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla, under scrutiny of the NHSTA, still struggles with level 2/3 driving by its own admissions (see recent earnings), whilst it&amp;#39;s competitors are clearly beating it in the race to offer robo-taxis, already deploying them in some major global cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise the Tesla Board and now Musk are looking to sell shares, for &amp;#39;tax&amp;#39; purposes or otherwise.  Tesla is falling quickly down the EV sales rankings in Europe (only 7% of EV sales YTD) and China (only 9% of EV sales YTD) where EV sales are growing rapidly and will likely hit 20% of automotive sales this year (the US might be 3%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investor narrative over Tesla and the market capitalisation is now so far removed from the realities of Tesla&amp;#39;s position in the EV market or indeed it&amp;#39;s realistic future revenue sources.&lt;/p&gt;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/wholesale-prices-rise-8point6percent-year-over-year-in-october-tied-for-highest-ever.html]

&lt;p&gt;Input prices are certainly increasing. For those of you who don’t know what they mean by “wholesale prices,” this is the price increase of bulk goods and services businesses use to make their end product or service. As to how bad this is … I’ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime. Inflation data comes out tomorrow. … which will likely be amplified by today’s Producer Price Index. Two of the big drivers were gasoline and the cost of autos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big takeaway for today is that businesses are paying more for the wholesale goods they need to operate and this will likely be reflected in the CPI tomorrow. In short, the companies you are invested in will need to contend with higher input prices by increasing the cost of goods and services (or reinvesting to become more efficient) which will in turn result in the less people can afford to buy on a limited income. If this hits a tipping point where wages are increasing slowly with inflation increasing quickly, people with limited wages will be forced to buy their needs at higher prices and budget on the want side, resulting in less sales of goods people can go without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it&amp;#39;s also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel&amp;#39;s 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, TSMC&amp;#39;s market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that&amp;#39;s a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don&amp;#39;t know how big this will be in 10 years, but it&amp;#39;s likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that&amp;#39;s also something that&amp;#39;s worth noting at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel&amp;#39;s lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel&amp;#39;s management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that&amp;#39;s good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it&amp;#39;s near that range right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bear Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit&amp;#39;s circejerk. So, it&amp;#39;s difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management&amp;#39;s conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn&amp;#39;t care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division&amp;#39;s predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/xxYyDIE&quot;&gt;positions or ban. bought 100 shares for now. will be selling some puts to enter into more. And then around the next earnings, will buy some calls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In a post on the company’s blog, Robinhood HOOD, +2.62% disclosed that a customer-support employee was tricked into giving access to systems late on Nov. 3. The hacker was then able to access a list of about 5 million email addresses as well as full names for about 2 million customers, with a smaller subset of customers — 310, according to Robinhood — potentially having more data at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company said that no social security numbers nor payment information was accessed, and no customers had suffered financial losses as a result. Robinhood’s blog stated that the hackers sought an extortion payment after the intrusion, but did not say if a ransom was paid. The company said it had informed law enforcement and called in cybersecurity company Mandiant Inc. MNDT, +3.00% to help investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Following a diligent review, putting the entire Robinhood community on notice of this incident now is the right thing to do,” Robinhood Chief Security Officer Caleb Sima said in the post. Robinhood is in the process of informing affected customers directly, the company disclosed. The company directed customers to the “Account Security” portion of its “Help Center” for more information on keeping personal data secure. Robinhood shares declined about 3% in after-hours trading, after closing with a 2.6% gain at $37.98.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not a lot since I only place money on them whenever I have some extra to spare. Diversifying my portfolio is currently my goal and right now I’m thinking of investing in lithium or copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With lithium I’m planning to focus on having Albemarle (&lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALB/&quot;&gt;ALB&lt;/a&gt;). They are one of the largest providers of lithium for batteries that power electric vehicles. They have solid earnings, even though the market seems still pretty volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper is also currently really volatile too, so I’m only thinking of placing some in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southerncoppercorp.com/&quot;&gt;Southern Copper Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCCO/&quot;&gt;SCCO&lt;/a&gt;). I chose a company that pays a dividend, and in their case they pay a dividend of $2.70 per share. I feel like they are a safe choice to invest in. Also thinking of FCX or FTCO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to explorations (I know they’re risky but there’s some potential) I lean more towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.solarisresources.com/&quot;&gt;Solaris Resources&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/&quot;&gt;SLSSF&lt;/a&gt;). They’re already drilling and there’s some strong profit potential if they continue to show good results. They recently started their maiden drilling at the Warintza South target, targeting the 4th major copper discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a lot since I’m a little cautious about going all out because of the current situation. I just want to diversify my portfolio and these are the ones I’m thinking of putting my money on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet EV companies who will have to compete with all the legacy car makers in the EV market, plus Tesla, plus all the other EV startups, are getting absurd valuations. What is it about making the powertrain electric that will suddenly make this a great business model? Autonomous driving subscriptions? Leasing cars to uber/lyft? I feel like I&amp;#39;m missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t doubt that EVs are the future and that it&amp;#39;s a huge market. But again, selling cars is an asset heavy, low margin business. So what am I missing? Or am I correct that the EV craze is overblown?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---edit---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from joecop&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.robinhood.com/2021/11/8/data-security-incident&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unauthorized party socially engineered a customer support employee by phone and obtained access to certain customer support systems. At this time, we understand that the unauthorized party obtained a list of email addresses for approximately five million people, and full names for a different group of approximately two million people. We also believe that for a more limited number of people—approximately 310 in total—additional personal information, including name, date of birth, and zip code, was exposed, with a subset of approximately 10 customers having more extensive account details revealed. We are in the process of making appropriate disclosures to affected people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so ultimately 4 different groups compromised with different amounts of data leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal takeaways: 60/40 is still okay-ish as in 2021. Higher returns can be achieved via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PE (private equity, not widely accessible to individual investors AFAIK other than SPAC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global Transport (Cannot find a corresponding ETF. Perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/299086/blackrock-future-of-transport-fund&quot;&gt;https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/299086/blackrock-future-of-transport-fund&lt;/a&gt; but given that it&amp;#39;s a UCITS fund US investors need to purchase via a fund manager)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value-add real-estate (Fundrise provided a value-add fund to accredited investors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global infrastructure ($IGF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct landing (Yieldstreet? Worth checking the fee structure and the underlying products)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EM debt (tons of closed-end funds and ETFs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it&amp;#39;s a very detailed a report covering lots of topics including inflation, crypto, tax hikes and 60/40 for 2022 with statistics. Highly recommend giving it a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks finished mixed today, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closing modestly in the red, breaking an insane rally pulled down by a decline in Tesla (TSLA) while the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) continued their march higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, finished the day 0.33% higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Labor Department released the monthly October jobs report, which showed the pace of employment greatly improved after two disappointing months, with the report citing declining coronavirus cases and increased demand for workers for the uptick. Here are the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in non-farm payrolls, October:&lt;/strong&gt; +531,000 vs. +450,000 expected, and a great improvement over the +194,000 job added in September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unemployment rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 4.6% vs. 4.7% expected, 4.8% in September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a press conference, President Joe Biden said of the Labor report, “Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. In this historically strong recovery, unemployment has fallen again today,” President Joe Biden said during a press conference on Friday.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though payrolls have grown every month so far in 2021, the economy remains more than 4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels following plunges in employment between March and April of 2020. And the civilian labor force was still down by nearly 3 million individuals compared to February 2020 as of October 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the inflation front, market participants are closely monitoring the Bureau of Labor’s October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to show yet another acceleration in consumer prices on both a monthly and annual basis, as ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances continue to cap production of goods at a time of soaring demand. Estimates as of Monday showed that consensus economists expect to see the CPI rise by 5.9% in October compared to last year, accelerating from September&amp;#39;s 5.4% annual rate to reach the fastest rise since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rubella Farooqi, Chief Economist at High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to clients, “We continue to expect that a normalization of demand and supply constraint or time will take pressure off inflation statistics. The exact timing is uncertain, given we cannot predict when supply chains will adjust. However, our best guess is that prices will start moderating by the middle of next year - possibly sooner if goods that are stuff in ports reach their destinations in the early part of the year, which will result in an excess supply of goods after holidays.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ford Motors (F) crossed the $20 per share threshold for the first time since mid-2001, with investors seemingly encouraged by the company’s pivot into electric vehicles and the upcoming blockbuster Rivian IPO, of which Ford owns 12%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell today but held onto the critical $1150 support after CEO Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers via a poll if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, a position worth roughly $20 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though it was unable to hold the gains by close, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) became the third company to breach the $2 trillion market cap threshold, joining Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italy&amp;#39;s antitrust regulator has started proceedings to fine Google for allegedly restrictive clauses in the terms of service consumers have to accept to use Google Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged more than 10% after Meta Platforms (FB, soon to be MVRS) selected their chips to power its data center. AMD explained that the two companies worked together to develop a high performance processor based on the company’s 3rd Generation EPYC Processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, AMD announced new chips called  &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1032/new-amd-instinct-mi200-series-accelerators-bring&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are optimized for high-performance computing and artificial-intelligence workloads. The company described them as &amp;quot;the first exascale-class GPU accelerators.&amp;quot; AMD competes with &lt;strong&gt;Nvidia&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;NVDA&lt;/strong&gt;) in GPUs. Sorry it sounds like jargon but as a massive semiconductor bull I could not be more excited for the future. I’ve said it many times before but personally NVDA is my #1, AMD is my #2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SoftBank’s Vision Fund, the largest tech-focused investment firm in the world with over $100 billion in capital, lost $10 billion this quarter amid the regulatory crackdown in China. The fund announced it was launching a $9 billion share buyback amid pressure from investors. The group’s largest asset, Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba , saw its valuation fall by around a third in the second quarter. Its stake in Chinese ride-hailer Didi, acquired for $12 billion, was valued at $7.5 billion. Another notable hit was Coupang (CPNG), a South Korean eCommerce company which gave up a third of its value.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue: $6.18 billion vs. $6.23 billion expected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal reported a 13% increase in year-over-year revenue for the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company issued a fourth-quarter forecast that fell well short of analysts’ expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting next year, customers will be able to make purchases on Amazon.com and the Amazon mobile shopping app using their Venmo accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock is down 5% after the earning report. It has been down from $310 to $230 and it is definitely oversold. Investors should buy the stock here as PayPal is still growing very healthy and there is still plenty of opportunities for PayPal to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov 8 (Reuters) - Roblox Corp exceeded market estimates for quarterly bookings on Monday as demand for its video games &amp;quot;MeepCity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Adopt Me!&amp;quot; stayed strong even after pandemic-led curbs eased.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Roblox, among the world&amp;#39;s most popular gaming sites for children, jumped 14% in extended trading.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People had turned to video games for entertainment during last year&amp;#39;s months-long isolation, sparking a boom that is yet to slow down despite the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from analytics firm Sensor Tower shows consumer spending on video games rose 7.7% in the third quarter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Mateo, California-based Roblox has capitalized on the boom by allowing users to create an in-game metaverse, a shared virtual world where people in the form of avatars can interact with others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company posted a 28% rise in bookings to $637.8 million for the third quarter. Analysts had expected bookings of $636.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk and other executives have many other generous in the money stock option awards, that will require both collateral to exercise and tax to be paid which can only realistically come from share sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shares would have had to be sold at some point, irrespective of his Twitter poll outcome.  More theatrics from Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla shareholders, like.most company shareholders in their defence, so often overlook the dilution effect of stock options and the inevitable share sell down by executives to cover the collateral needed to exercise the options and to pay any taxes due.&lt;/p&gt;
