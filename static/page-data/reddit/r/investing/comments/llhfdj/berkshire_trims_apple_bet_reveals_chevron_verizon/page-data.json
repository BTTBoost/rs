Berkshire bought stock in Verizon Communications Inc., insurance broker Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. and Chevron Corp., bets that were granted confidential status and not revealed in a third-quarter regulatory filing, according to an updated document released Tuesday. The Apple stake reduction left Berkshire with a holding valued at US$120 billion at the end of 2020, according to another filing.</p>\n\n<p>Berkshire spent the last three months of the year revamping its bets on some other sectors. Buffett’s conglomerate cut a few bank holdings, exiting JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and M&amp;T Bank Corp. while slashing its Wells Fargo &amp; Co. stake by 59 per cent. The company also shifted a recent bet on drugmakers by increasing a stake in Merck &amp; Co Inc., Abbvie Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., while exiting a recent investment in Pfizer Inc.</p>\n\n<p>Berkshire also exited a bet on Barrick Gold Corp. The investment was a surprise when it was revealed last year, given Buffett’s years of chiding the precious metal.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/berkshire-trims-apple-bet-reveals-chevron-verizon-holdings-1.1564415\">https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/berkshire-trims-apple-bet-reveals-chevron-verizon-holdings-1.1564415</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/llhfdj/berkshire_trims_apple_bet_reveals_chevron_verizon/","title":"Berkshire trims Apple bet, reveals Chevron, Verizon holdings","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T02:28:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 02:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"34371cc8-b9a9-55ce-b7ff-d288cb935361","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/llhfdj/berkshire_trims_apple_bet_reveals_chevron_verizon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/llhfdj/berkshire_trims_apple_bet_reveals_chevron_verizon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"rockinoutwith2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rockinoutwith2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rockinoutwith2","score":329,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"伯克希尔下调苹果押注，透露雪佛龙、威瑞森持股。","the_new_excerpt":"几天前，在这个子上有一些 \"奇怪 \"的猜测，华伦?\n或许买下了特斯拉......最后变成了Verizon和雪佛龙（呵呵）。\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n巴菲特旗下的伯克希尔哈撒韦公司减持苹果公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"伯克希爾下調蘋果押注，透露雪佛龍、威瑞森持股。","the_new_excerpt":"幾天前，在這個子上有一些 \"奇怪 \"的猜測，華倫?\n或許買下了特斯拉......最後變成了Verizon和雪佛龍（呵呵）。\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n巴菲特旗下的伯克希爾哈撒韋公司減持蘋果公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-331624e7-0df0-5ccd-837b-f1045c5826c1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llhd3d/you_degenerates_made_the_economist_print_daddy/","title":"You degenerates made The Economist print, \"Daddy Musk.\"","date":"February 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你们这些堕落的人让《经济学家》印上了 \"马斯克爸爸\"。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們這些墮落的人讓《經濟學家》印上了 \"馬斯克爸爸\"。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-286c4498-33c3-50a8-b2d5-8bd0d67c3132","excerpt":"America’s sports betting brands dominated the Wall Street markets in 2020, but\nwhile DraftKings and Penn National are catching all of the headlines, Canada’s\ntheScore is proving to be one of the strongest performers in the financial\nmarket.\n\nUp nearly 900% over the last four months, theScore doubled…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lkt8wv/thescore_eyes_entry_into_us_exchanges_following/","title":"theScore Eyes Entry Into US Exchanges Following Reverse Split Stock Announcement","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 17, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"TheScore在宣布反向拆分股票后着眼于进入美国交易所。","the_new_excerpt":"美国的体育博彩品牌在2020年主导了华尔街市场，但。\n当DraftKings和Penn National吸引了所有的头条新闻时，加拿大的DraftKings和Penn National却没有任何反应。\n事实证明，theScore是金融领域表现最强劲的公司之一。\n市场。\n\n在过去的四个月里，上涨了近900%，Score翻了一番。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"TheScore在宣佈反向拆分股票後着眼於進入美國交易所。","the_new_excerpt":"美國的體育博彩品牌在2020年主導了華爾街市場，但。\n當DraftKings和Penn National吸引了所有的頭條新聞時，加拿大的DraftKings和Penn National卻沒有任何反應。\n事實證明，theScore是金融領域表現最強勁的公司之一。\n市場。\n\n在過去的四個月裏，上漲了近900%，Score翻了一番。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-34371cc8-b9a9-55ce-b7ff-d288cb935361","previousId":"RedditPost-331624e7-0df0-5ccd-837b-f1045c5826c1","nextId":"RedditPost-286c4498-33c3-50a8-b2d5-8bd0d67c3132","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/llhfdj/berkshire_trims_apple_bet_reveals_chevron_verizon/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
