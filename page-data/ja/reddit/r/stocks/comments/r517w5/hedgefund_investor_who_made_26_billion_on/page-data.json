The discovery of the variant resulted in one of the worst Black Friday trading sessions in recent memory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.98%, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, 1.62% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 2.08% all tumbling by at least 2%, but Ackman’s comments suggest that investors’ knee-jerk response may have been an overreaction.</p>\n\n<p>Bond yields on Friday also fell as prices for government debt saw a rush to the perceived safety of Treasurys on the back of fresh concerns about new restrictions that could result from a strain of COVID that the World Health Organization on Friday designated a variant of concern. However, stocks were bouncing back on Monday and the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.528% was up 8 basis points at 1.56%. Prices for Treasurys fall as yields rise. </p>\n\n<p>Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, is known for his lucrative COVID wager. The Financial Times reported back in 2020 that the investor cashed out on bet that netted him a $2.6 billion profit on a $27 million at risk, on the premise that insurance premiums would soar during the height of the 2020 COVID pandemic as economies locked down. He also later in 2020 said that he placed bearish bets on corporate credit on the day that Pfizer PFE, -0.64%  and BioNTech BNTX, 3.65% released positive trial data on their COVID-19 vaccine, which triggered a whipsaw rally in stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Ackman was wagering that the vaccines would lead to mask-wearing complacency. However, that bet presumably turned out wrong as markets continued to surge in the aftermath of those vaccines. The danger posed by the omicron variant isn’t yet fully understood, even though governments in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas immediately restricted travel from southern Africa. Vaccine manufacturers have said that they are examining the variant closely and note that the current batch of remedies might still prove effective against the strain and new vaccines could be readied in early 2022 if needed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hedge-fund-investor-who-made-2-6-billion-on-pandemic-trades-says-omicron-could-be-bullish-for-stock-market-11638198173?mod=home-page\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hedge-fund-investor-who-made-2-6-billion-on-pandemic-trades-says-omicron-could-be-bullish-for-stock-market-11638198173?mod=home-page</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r517w5/hedgefund_investor_who_made_26_billion_on/","title":"Hedge-fund investor who made $2.6 billion on pandemic trades says omicron could be bullish for stock market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-29T20:32:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-29 20:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r517w5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r517w5/hedgefund_investor_who_made_26_billion_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r517w5/hedgefund_investor_who_made_26_billion_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"mikeyrocksin2021","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mikeyrocksin2021","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mikeyrocksin2021","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"パンデミック・トレードで26億ドルを稼いだヘッジファンド投資家、オミクロンは株式市場にとって強気の材料になると語る","the_new_excerpt":"ヘッジファンド界の重鎮、ビル・アックマン氏は週末、「COVID-19」の原因となるコロナウイルスの新型オミクロン変異体が証明されれば、株価に強気の材料になると述べた。\nCOVID-19の原因となるコロナウイルスが、感染者の症状が軽度から中程度であることが証明されれば、株にとっては強気の材料となるだろう。\nこのウイルスに感染しても、症状が軽度から中等度であることが証明されれば、株にとっては強気の材料となるだろう。この亜種の発見により\nこの亜種が発見されたことで、最悪のブラックフライデーとなりました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在大流行病交易中赚取26亿美元的对冲基金投资者表示，大流行病可能会对股市产生利好作用","the_new_excerpt":"对冲基金大亨比尔-阿克曼（Bill Ackman）周末表示，新的欧米茄变体的\n导致COVID-19的冠状病毒的新变种，如果它被证明会导致感染者出现轻度到中度的症状，那么可能会对股票产生利好。\n感染者会出现轻度至中度症状。该病毒的发现\n该变种的发现导致了最糟糕的黑色星期五之一...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在大流行病交易中賺取26億美元的對沖基金投資者表示，大流行病可能會對股市產生利好作用","the_new_excerpt":"對沖基金大亨比爾-阿克曼（Bill Ackman）週末表示，新的歐米茄變體的\n導致COVID-19的冠狀病毒的新變種，如果它被證明會導致感染者出現輕度到中度的症狀，那麼可能會對股票產生利好。\n感染者會出現輕度至中度症狀。該病毒的發現\n該變種的發現導致了最糟糕的黑色星期五之一...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r533z7","excerpt":"I hear this all the time.
