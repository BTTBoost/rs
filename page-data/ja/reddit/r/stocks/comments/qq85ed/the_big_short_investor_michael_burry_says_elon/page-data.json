The Tesla CEO also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-proposes-selling-10-percent-tesla-stock-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>launched a Twitter poll</strong></a> asking whether he should sell 10% of his holdings, citing pressure from US lawmakers who are pushing for a &quot;<a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/taxing-billionaires-would-raise-557-billion-elon-musk-billionaire-tax2021-11?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>billionaire tax</strong></a>&quot; that would target the ultra-wealthy&#39;s unrealized stock gains.</p>\n\n<p>Burry&#39;s tweet implies those might just be excuses. The investor of &quot;The Big Short&quot; fame and head of Scion Asset Management posted a link to a SEC filing in August, which noted that Musk has pledged about 88 million shares, or 36% of his total stake, as collateral for personal loans as of June 30.</p>\n\n<p>Musk had 41% of his shares pledged as collateral for his debts at the end of December last year, and 48% as of June 30 last year, previous filings show.</p>\n\n<p>Burry appears to be suggesting that Musk isn&#39;t eyeing a stock sale in order to feed millions of people, in response to a legislative proposal, or because he could <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-options-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>face a $10 billion tax bill</strong></a> when he exercises a slew of stock options that expire in August 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Burry&#39;s theory is that Musk needs some cash to service the loans he&#39;s taken out using his Tesla stock. That practice <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-criticized-avoiding-taxes-deserves-break-philanthropy-lifestyle-loopholes-2021-6?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>drew heavy scrutiny</strong></a> this summer after a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax\"><strong>ProPublica investigation</strong></a> detailed how some of the world&#39;s wealthiest people borrow against their stock to minimize their tax burdens.</p>\n\n<h2>Bubble fears</h2>\n\n<p>Besides tweeting about Musk, Burry marked his return to Twitter with a new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/header_photo\"><strong>header image</strong></a>. His choice of &quot;Satire of the Tulip Mania,&quot; a painting by Jan Brueghel the Younger that ridicules the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tulipmania-bubble-story-2014-9?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>Dutch tulip bubble</strong></a> in the 1600s, is undoubtedly a fresh warning about the current market mania.</p>\n\n<p>The painting depicts tulip speculators as mindless monkeys, and shows them weighing the bulbs, counting money, taking inventory, and going into debt, fighting over, and even dying for the flowers.</p>\n\n<p>Burry has <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-tesla-robinhood-bitcoin-gamestop-bubble-2021-3?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>painted</strong></a> the immense hype around meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, and the frantic buying of Tesla shares and other assets, as clear signs of rampant speculation.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Burry has diagnosed a <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-warns-stocks-options-dotcom-bubble-crash-2021-9?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>historic market bubble</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>predicted a devastating crash</strong></a> in recent months. His fund also <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-cathie-wood-ark-2021-8?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"><strong>held bearish put options</strong></a> on shares of Tesla and Cathie Wood&#39;s Ark Invest at the end of June. Given that context, his choice of Twitter image suggests he sees history repeating itself.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-stock-market-bubble-2021-11\">https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-stock-market-bubble-2021-11</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qq85ed/the_big_short_investor_michael_burry_says_elon/","title":"'The Big Short' investor Michael Burry says Elon Musk may want to sell Tesla stock to cover his personal debts","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-09T20:56:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-09 20:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qq85ed","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qq85ed/the_big_short_investor_michael_burry_says_elon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qq85ed/the_big_short_investor_michael_burry_says_elon/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Wilingaway","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wilingaway","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Wilingaway","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"The Big Short」の投資家であるMichael Burry氏は、Elon Musk氏が個人的な負債をカバーするためにTesla社の株式を売却したいと考えているのではないかと述べています。","the_new_excerpt":" * マイケル・バリーは、イーロン・マスクが個人的な負債を補うためにテスラの株式を売却することを提案しました。\n   個人的な負債を補うためにTeslaの株を売りたいのではないかと示唆しました。\n * \"The Big Short \"の投資家は、テスラのCEOが8800万株をローンの担保として差し入れていると指摘しました。\n   融資の担保にしていました。\n * Burryはまた、今日の市場とオランダのチューリップを微妙に比較しました。\n   チューリップ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"大空头》投资者Michael Burry称埃隆-马斯克可能想卖掉特斯拉股票以偿还个人债务","the_new_excerpt":" * 迈克尔-伯利建议埃隆-马斯克可能想卖掉一些特斯拉的股票，以弥补他的个人债务。\n   弥补他的个人债务。\n * \"大空头 \"投资者指出，特斯拉CEO有8800万股股票被抵押作为\n   贷款抵押品。\n * Burry还对今天的市场和荷兰的 \"郁金香 \"做了一个微妙的比较。\n   郁金香...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"大空頭》投資者Michael Burry稱埃隆-馬斯克可能想賣掉特斯拉股票以償還個人債務","the_new_excerpt":" * 邁克爾-伯利建議埃隆-馬斯克可能想賣掉一些特斯拉的股票，以彌補他的個人債務。\n   彌補他的個人債務。\n * \"大空頭 \"投資者指出，特斯拉CEO有8800萬股股票被抵押作爲\n   貸款抵押品。\n * Burry還對今天的市場和荷蘭的 \"鬱金香 \"做了一個微妙的比較。\n   鬱金香...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qq92ss","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq92ss/99/","title":"99%","date":"November 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"99%","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"99%","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"99%","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qq9ne8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq9ne8/were_the_future/","title":"We’re the Future","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 09, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"We're the Future","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们是未来","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們是未來","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qq85ed","previousId":"RedditPost-qq92ss","nextId":"RedditPost-qq9ne8","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qq85ed/the_big_short_investor_michael_burry_says_elon/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
