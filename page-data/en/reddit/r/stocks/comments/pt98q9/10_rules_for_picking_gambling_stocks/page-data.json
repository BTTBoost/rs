Add away!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Know  your handle from your gross and net gaming revenue. Sportsbooks may  dazzle you with handle, but the bottom line figure of gross or net  gaming revenue is their traditional &quot;revenue&quot;. Handle includes free bets  which don&#39;t lead to eventual EBITDA.  <a href=\"https://www.gambling.com/news/us/indiana-august-sports-betting-handle-up-11-posts-215-6m-2655900\">See here Indiana&#39;s handle increased 11% but their gaming revenue decreased 5%</a></li>\n<li>Future  seasons and competitions of sports are baked into revenue projections.  We often see &quot;NFL season will be huge!&quot; or &quot;NBA games have been on the  edge&quot;. All revised guidance takes into account seasons about to start or  even big competitions like the World Cup.</li>\n<li>Be  wary of the legalization landscape trap. We often hear &quot;wait til  California, Florida and Texas legalize&quot;. Revenue is going to double.  First, this could be years off. Second, the revenue won&#39;t drip uniformly  to each provider with some state lotteries getting the bulk. If it was  that easy, DKNG would be at $100 already. We&#39;re bullish but this is a  long road.</li>\n<li>While operators such as PENN (Barstools), DKNG and Fanduel try to differentiate themselves, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DKNG/comments/peimu7/copy_paste/\">this post</a> proves that most sportbetting stocks move in unison (with selected over performers). Credit to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/No_Ordinary_9661/\">u/No_Ordinary_9661</a> for the post. Buy the sector not a stock. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p41n1y/betz_sports_betting_etf_a_closer_look/\">Invest in BETZ</a></li>\n<li>Sportsbetting stocks are not a hedge against the market. Gambling stocks move up and down sometimes with - and sometimes - against the market. If  gambling legalization will be favorable, total-spend up and we see new  customers on the horizon, buy. If we see lack of legalization, bans and  gamblers turning to fantasy NFTs or another, sell.</li>\n<li>A  sports data provider such as SRAD/Sportradar makes it profits as a B2B  business but slowly these companies are becoming B2C since 22% of their  revenue is from gross gaming revenue of the sportsbooks (according to  filings). The more sportsbooks there are, the more fees and % they will  get. These companies trade at a premium in terms of EV/Revenue as they  have larger barriers to entry and often are profit-making already.</li>\n<li>AI  is a big deal in sportsbetting. The tech allows a company to increase  customer spending, restrict/block winning customers and offer customized  products per region. Look for companies investing heavily in AI.</li>\n<li>M&amp;A  is trending in sportsbetting stocks (think DKNG/Golden  Nugget/Entain(!!), PENN/The Score) as the cost of customer acquisition  has soared and buying existing customers is the low hanging fruit.  Companies which can make M&amp;A value-adds and acquire new gamblers are  going to make it.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t  forget about sportsbetting stocks over in Europe. FLTR, Betsson,  Leovegas AB, Evolution AB and Entain are all legit companies with some  exciting stories.</li>\n<li>There  are hidden upsides to sportsbetting stocks. Could DKNG start to offer  stock bets and even take on HOOD? AI could reduce costs of doing  business by half. Vig isn&#39;t getting cheaper, so our EV/EBITDA ratios  decrease favorably.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all folks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pt98q9/10_rules_for_picking_gambling_stocks/","title":"10 Rules for Picking Gambling Stocks","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-22T19:59:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-22 19:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pt98q9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pt98q9/10_rules_for_picking_gambling_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pt98q9/10_rules_for_picking_gambling_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ResearchandstuffptII","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ResearchandstuffptII","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ResearchandstuffptII","score":86,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ギャンブル株を選ぶための10のルール","the_new_excerpt":"DKNG、PENN、RSIなどの話題で盛り上がっていますが、ここでは一般的なポイントをご紹介します。\n私の経験から、ギャンブル株の一般的なポイントをご紹介します。ぜひ参考にしてみてください。\n\n\n\n 1.  ゲームの総収入と純収入からハンドルネームを知る。スポーツブックは\n     ハンドルネームに惑わされるかもしれませんが、最終的な数字であるグロスまたはネットのゲーム収入は\n    ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"挑选赌博股票的10条规则","the_new_excerpt":"在所有关于DKNG、PENN、RSI和其他方面的讨论中，这里有一些一般性的指导意见\n从我的经验来看，关于赌博股票的一些一般要点。添加完毕!\n\n\n\n 1.  从你的博彩总收入和净收入中了解你的手柄。体育馆可能\n     但毛额或净额博彩的底线数字却让你眼花缭乱。\n    ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"挑選賭博股票的10條規則","the_new_excerpt":"在所有關於DKNG、PENN、RSI和其他方面的討論中，這裏有一些一般性的指導意見\n從我的經驗來看，關於賭博股票的一些一般要點。添加完畢!\n\n\n\n 1.  從你的博彩總收入和淨收入中瞭解你的手柄。體育館可能\n     但毛額或淨額博彩的底線數字卻讓你眼花繚亂。\n    ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1440729168983965705","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1440729168983965705","title":"Monday: The 2nd coming of Lehman is here\n\nTuesday: Ok it's Bear Stearns or LTCM\n\nWednesday: I mean...it was like a random 2% down day in the stock market?","date":"September 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"月曜日。リーマンの再来はここにある\n\n火曜日 ベアー・スターンズかLTCMか？\n\n水曜：そうか。つまり......株式市場で2％の下落率をランダムに記録したようなもの？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"星期一。雷曼的第二次到来是在这里\n\n周二。好吧，是贝尔斯登还是LTCM？\n\n星期三。我的意思是......这就像股市中随机出现的2%的下跌日？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"星期一。雷曼的第二次到來是在這裏\n\n週二。好吧，是貝爾斯登還是LTCM？\n\n星期三。我的意思是......這就像股市中隨機出現的2%的下跌日？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pt872a","excerpt":"U.S. auto giant Ford Motor is diving deeper into electric vehicles in an\nunexpected way.
