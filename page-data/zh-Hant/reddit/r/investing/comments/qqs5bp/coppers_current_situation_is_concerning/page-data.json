The prices are going up and down and with the demand for reviewable energy, everything’s going to be messier.

They are a pretty small producer but has no debts and recently increased the monthly dividend they are paying 16.7% to $0.035 per common share, or $0.42 annually. </p>\n\n<p>I also have <a href=\"https://www.solarisresources.com/\">Solaris Resources</a> (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/\">SLSSF</a>) which I got despite it being risky since it is an exploration. They have positive results with their drilling, and they recently started their maiden drilling at the Warintza South target, targeting the 4th major copper discovery. They also have a massive cash cushion and their cash burn is way under, plus they have about $60 million on the balance sheet right now. I also placed some on <a href=\"https://www.comstockmining.com/\">Comstock Mining Inc</a>.(<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LODE/\">LODE</a>), and their primary focus of the company’s exploration efforts are their projects in the Dayton Resource/Spring Valley as well as the Lucerne resource area.</p>\n\n<p>I am not planning to invest on any anytime soon, since I feel a little anxious with all the investments I made seeing how volatile the situation is right now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qqs5bp/coppers_current_situation_is_concerning/","title":"Copper’s current situation is concerning","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-10T12:36:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-10 12:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qqs5bp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qqs5bp/coppers_current_situation_is_concerning/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qqs5bp/coppers_current_situation_is_concerning/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"InterestingsBed","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/InterestingsBed","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"InterestingsBed","score":336,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"銅の現状が気になる","the_new_excerpt":"数ヶ月前に銅の銘柄に投資したのですが、最近の変動の激しさを見ると\n最近の銅の変動を見ていると、投資したお金を心配しなければならないような気がします。\n価格は上がったり下がったりしていますし、見直し可能なエネルギーの需要もあります。\nすべてが厄介なことになりそうです。問題になっているのは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"铜的目前状况令人担忧","the_new_excerpt":"我在几个月前投资了一些铜的股票，看到它最近的波动情况\n最近，我觉得我应该对我在上面投资的钱感到担心。\n价格忽高忽低，而且随着可审查能源的需求。\n一切都会变得更加混乱。已经有问题的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"銅的目前狀況令人擔憂","the_new_excerpt":"我在幾個月前投資了一些銅的股票，看到它最近的波動情況\n最近，我覺得我應該對我在上面投資的錢感到擔心。\n價格忽高忽低，而且隨着可審查能源的需求。\n一切都會變得更加混亂。已經有問題的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qqkbbc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqkbbc/well_its_official_this_is_all_our_fault/","title":"Well, it's official: this is all our fault.","date":"November 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"公式には、すべて私たちのせいだと言われています。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"嗯，这是官方的：这都是我们的错。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"嗯，這是官方的：這都是我們的錯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qq9vgf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq9vgf/the_real_wolf_of_wall_street/","title":"The real wolf of Wall Street","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 10, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ウォール街の真の狼","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"真正的华尔街之狼","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"真正的華爾街之狼","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qqs5bp","previousId":"RedditPost-qqkbbc","nextId":"RedditPost-qq9vgf","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qqs5bp/coppers_current_situation_is_concerning/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
