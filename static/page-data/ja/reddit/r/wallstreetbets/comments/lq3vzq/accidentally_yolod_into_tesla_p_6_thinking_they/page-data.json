Everything I could afford and still pay rent. When I bought them the buy price was 8.5 and sell 0. Yes 0. I thought that was because they were just so far OTM. Today I watched Tesla tank and neither the buy or sell price moved. I looked at some of the other Tesla options available on IG (there&#39;s only a really random assortment available, not a whole chain). I realized they were all 10000+ and calls at 60000 were something like 5x the price of puts at 60000. I&#39;m now convinced that for some stupid reason IG prices option strikes in cents for equities (I have traded VIX options with them before and they&#39;re priced in dollars). So I&#39;m 99% sure I just YOLO&#39;d into $6 puts. I can&#39;t sell them cause they&#39;re worth exactly 0. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been so stupid. Guess I 💎✋with my only hope being Tesla going bankrupt (I think they&#39;re overvalued but never going bankrupt). Wish me luck I guess. Fuck me</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: spent all my savings on Tesla $6p Jan 22 thinking they were $600p Jan 22</p>\n\n<p>Proof: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/ZTDWmVp\">http://imgur.com/gallery/ZTDWmVp</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 1: I&#39;m currently on the phone to IG and the guy is insisting that they are for $600 and IG don&#39;t have any for $6. I&#39;m trying to explain that it&#39;s impossible for them to be for $600 pls help.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3vzq/accidentally_yolod_into_tesla_p_6_thinking_they/","title":"Accidentally YOLO'd into Tesla P $6 thinking they were $600","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T13:24:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 13:24","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7f9bd565-e12b-5995-850f-ca9a62fa99f8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3vzq/accidentally_yolod_into_tesla_p_6_thinking_they/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3vzq/accidentally_yolod_into_tesla_p_6_thinking_they/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/nNfQci5uXJv70l-bcXwjqneXczLK84hxDcsc1_g1fDs.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fdd6701b478db9825921f37a27718798d8516aa2","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"NoahBLB","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoahBLB","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"NoahBLB","score":3431,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不小心YOLO到了特斯拉P 6美元，以为是600美元","the_new_excerpt":"所以我住在英国，上周我用IG买了125倍特斯拉把600 1月22日。\n那是1000英镑。我的学生贷款。我可以负担得起的一切，仍然支付租金。\n当我买入他们的时候，买入价是8.5，卖出价是0.是的0.我想这是...。\n因为他们只是远远的OTM。今天我看了特斯拉的坦克... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不小心YOLO到了特斯拉P 6美元，以爲是600美元","the_new_excerpt":"所以我住在英國，上週我用IG買了125倍特斯拉把600 1月22日。\n那是1000英鎊。我的學生貸款。我可以負擔得起的一切，仍然支付租金。\n當我買入他們的時候，買入價是8.5，賣出價是0.是的0.我想這是...。\n因爲他們只是遠遠的OTM。今天我看了特斯拉的坦克... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bc0ed1d2-897f-54cd-a430-39eacd81d197","excerpt":"Disclaimer: I'm heavily simplifying a very complex topic for the sake of keeping\nthis post brief.\n\nFolks, close your trading app. Take a deep breath.
