Taiwan responded to Xi by calling on Beijing to abandon its coercion, reiterating that only Taiwan&#39;s people could decide their future. Democratically ruled Taiwan has come under increased military and political pressure from Beijing to accept its sovereignty, but Taipei has pledged to defend its freedom. Speaking at Beijing&#39;s Great Hall of the People, Xi said the Chinese people have a &quot;glorious tradition&quot; of opposing separatism.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Taiwan independence separatism is the biggest obstacle to achieving the reunification of the motherland, and the most serious hidden danger to national rejuvenation,&quot; he said on the anniversary of the revolution that overthrew the last imperial dynasty in 1911. Peaceful &quot;reunification&quot; best meets the overall interests of the Taiwanese people, but China will protect its sovereignty and unity, he added. &quot;No one should underestimate the Chinese people&#39;s staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,&quot; Xi said. &quot;The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled.&quot; He struck a slightly softer tone than in July, his last major speech mentioning Taiwan, in which he vowed to &quot;smash&quot; any attempts at formal independence. In 2019, he directly threatened to use force to bring the island under Beijing&#39;s control.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the speech was poorly received in Taiwan. The presidential office said they were a sovereign independent country, not part of the People&#39;s Republic of China, and had clearly rejected China&#39;s offer of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; to rule the island. &quot;The nation&#39;s future rests in the hands of Taiwan&#39;s people,&quot; the office said.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q4tr4w/chinas_xi_vows_reunification_with_taiwan/","title":"China's Xi vows 'reunification' with Taiwan","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-09T22:40:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-09 22:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q4tr4w","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q4tr4w/chinas_xi_vows_reunification_with_taiwan/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q4tr4w/chinas_xi_vows_reunification_with_taiwan/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"WickedSensitiveCrew","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WickedSensitiveCrew","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"WickedSensitiveCrew","score":727,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"習近平氏、台湾との「統一」を宣言","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-says-reunification-with-taiwan-must-will-be-realised-2021-10-09/\n\n中国の習近平国家主席は、土曜日に台湾との「平和的統一」を実現すると宣言しました。\n中国の習近平国家主席は、台湾との「平和的統一」を達成することを宣言し、中国との間で1週間にわたる緊張状態が続いた後も、武力行使については直接言及しませんでした。\n中国と台湾の間には1週間にわたる緊張関係がありました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"中国的习近平发誓要与台湾 \"统一\"。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-says-reunification-with-taiwan-must-will-be-realised-2021-10-09/\n\n中国国家主席习近平星期六发誓要实现 \"和平统一\"。\n与台湾实现 \"和平统一\"，并在与中国的紧张关系持续一周后没有直接提到使用武力。\n在与中国的紧张关系持续了一周之后，中国国家主席习近平没有直接提到使用武力。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中國的習近平發誓要與臺灣 \"統一\"。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-says-reunification-with-taiwan-must-will-be-realised-2021-10-09/\n\n中國國家主席習近平星期六發誓要實現 \"和平統一\"。\n與臺灣實現 \"和平統一\"，並在與中國的緊張關係持續一週後沒有直接提到使用武力。\n在與中國的緊張關係持續了一週之後，中國國家主席習近平沒有直接提到使用武力。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q4shwq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q4shwq/eating_my_breakfast_at_market_open_waiting_to_see/","title":"Eating my breakfast at market open waiting to see how much I lost","date":"October 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"マーケットオープンで朝食を食べ、どれだけ減ったかを確認する。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"在市场上吃着我的早餐，等待着看我损失了多少钱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在市場上喫着我的早餐，等待着看我損失了多少錢","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q4qk7h","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q4qk7h/few_understand_this/","title":"Few understand this.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 10, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"このことを理解している人は少ない。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"很少有人理解这一点。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"很少有人理解這一點。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q4tr4w","previousId":"RedditPost-q4shwq","nextId":"RedditPost-q4qk7h","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q4tr4w/chinas_xi_vows_reunification_with_taiwan/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
