Wealthfront has me invested in dividends stocks (SCHD) at some nominal percentage (maybe 10% of portfolio) for a taxable account. I had read a post the other day where someone had commented, “why are you investing in dividend ETFs, are you retired?” Is this a consideration? Should I not be in dividend yielding ETFs unless I’m in retirement?</p>\n\n<p>Background: only about 20% of my portfolio is in WF and I manage everything else myself. I just get $40k managed free there and they do tax loss harvesting well. So I’m really wondering if I should be more in on dividend ETFs in my other taxable accounts or prioritizing more toward like VTI (which I’m heavily in as well). </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: are higher dividend yielding ETFs like SCHD worth holding for a younger investor?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r16ofc/dividend_etf_for_30s_investor/","title":"Dividend ETF for 30s investor?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-24T22:36:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-24 22:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r16ofc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r16ofc/dividend_etf_for_30s_investor/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r16ofc/dividend_etf_for_30s_investor/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"SkinnyPete16","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SkinnyPete16","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SkinnyPete16","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r0wwq6","excerpt":"I was looking at VTI somewhere and noticed the concentration in large caps,\nwhich seems significantly higher than even last year when the rule of thumb was\n75% VOO+25% VXF = VTI.
