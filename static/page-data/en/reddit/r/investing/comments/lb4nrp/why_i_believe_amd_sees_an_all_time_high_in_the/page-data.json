This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It&#39;s chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD&#39;s short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>There are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung\">https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Along with these basic facts reflecting on AMD&#39;s product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.</p>\n\n<p>AMD&#39;s Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.</p>\n\n<p>The one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it&#39;s stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this is all helpful!  </p>\n\n<p>Disclosure: I own 30 shares of AMD and will continue to hold for the years to come.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lb4nrp/why_i_believe_amd_sees_an_all_time_high_in_the/","title":"Why I believe AMD sees an All Time High in the coming months","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T23:33:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 23:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"fe13c20d-1b82-5b25-81dc-29fadaa485a3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb4nrp/why_i_believe_amd_sees_an_all_time_high_in_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb4nrp/why_i_believe_amd_sees_an_all_time_high_in_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"PeanutInvestor","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PeanutInvestor","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PeanutInvestor","score":238,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么我相信AMD在未来几个月会出现历史新高？","the_new_excerpt":"AMD是Robinhood去年年底限制性股票名单中的另一只目标股票。\n一周。这是荒唐的，因为AMD是最近芯片厂商中的主要玩家。\n似乎已经在市场份额上超过了英特尔。它的芯片既用于\nPS5和Xbox系列S/X，显示出它是一个主要的玩家在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼我相信AMD在未來幾個月會出現歷史新高？","the_new_excerpt":"AMD是Robinhood去年年底限制性股票名單中的另一隻目標股票。\n一週。這是荒唐的，因爲AMD是最近芯片廠商中的主要玩家。\n似乎已經在市場份額上超過了英特爾。它的芯片既用於\nPS5和Xbox系列S/X，顯示出它是一個主要的玩家在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1356716857236062223","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1356716857236062223","title":"Amazon Net Income (Millions)...\n'20: 21,309\n'19: 11,620\n'18: 10,070\n'17: 3,033\n'16: 2,371\n'15: 596\n'14: -241\n'13: 274\n'12: -39\n'11: 631\n'10: 1,152\n'09: 902\n'08: 645\n'07: 476\n'06: 190\n'05: 359\n'04: 588\n'03: 35\n'02: -149\n'01: -567\n'00: -1,411\n'99: -720\n'98: -125\n'97: -31\n$AMZN","date":"February 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"亚马逊净收入（百万）...\n'20: 21,309\n'19: 11,620\n'18: 10,070\n'17: 3,033\n'16: 2,371\n'15: 596\n'14: -241\n'13: 274\n'12: -39\n'11: 631\n'10: 1,152\n'09: 902\n'08: 645\n'07: 476\n'06: 190\n'05: 359\n'04: 588\n'03: 35\n'02: -149\n'01: -567\n'00: -1,411\n'99: -720\n'98: -125\n'97: -31\n$AMZN","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"亞馬遜淨收入（百萬）...\n'20: 21,309\n'19: 11,620\n'18: 10,070\n'17: 3,033\n'16: 2,371\n'15: 596\n'14: -241\n'13: 274\n'12: -39\n'11: 631\n'10: 1,152\n'09: 902\n'08: 645\n'07: 476\n'06: 190\n'05: 359\n'04: 588\n'03: 35\n'02: -149\n'01: -567\n'00: -1,411\n'99: -720\n'98: -125\n'97: -31\n$AMZN","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2d923619-f6e4-5ada-b220-e9896666765b","excerpt":"How is it going my homies\n\nI made this post on investing\n[https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8yi83/common_misconceptions_about_markets/]\na few days ago explaining all of the QAnon fantasies and why the top could\nalready be behind us.
