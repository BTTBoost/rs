Mortgage debt is at ATH, consumer debt is 2x higher than ever, lumber futures are down 60% but physical lumber isn&#39;t moving, unemployment is still 50% higher than in 2009, housing starts are double what they were in 2008, and median house prices just broke $300,000 for the first time ever, inflation adjusted. All of which are bearish indicators for the economy. Houses r fuk</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.) Mortgage Debt and Consumer Debt is at an All Time High</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having high mortgage debt makes your house a debt and not an asset. It is sitting right above <strong>10 trillion dollars.</strong> If it goes any higher, we are at an extreme risk for higher foreclosures. However, consumer debt may be a greater issue. It is currently nearing <strong>2x what it was in 2008.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rhy0xeife3b71.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31eedce488849fd4b9c956a4fea74ecb0cda4881\">https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.) Lumber Futures Have Fallen, Physical Has Not</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another way to tell if we are in a bubble is by comparing the futures market to actual prices. When there is a large gap in these two, it usually indicates people are still willing to pay much higher prices for a large supply. It doesn&#39;t make any economical sense. People still feel that lumber is in extremely high demand, and will buy lumber (which isn&#39;t in high demand), and buy as much as they can anticipating the price to continue going up. It&#39;s artificial price increases.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2z24wwlmf3b71.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a326e28b9e16725f41c0df7375d549441afeb22d\">https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.) Unemployment is Still Extremely High After COVID Restrictions Lifted</strong></p>\n\n<p>Unemployment numbers are still 50% higher than they were in 2019. There&#39;s no reason to go back to work for ~2% of the population, because the stimulus checks and unemployment add up to more than minimum wage. This money has to come from somewhere, a.k.a money printing. This in turn adds up to more inflation, which is my next point.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6nxq3o6lg3b71.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a33a45e21fbb24f61bd30f779b8ca38280b2af86\">https://www.macrotrends.net/1316/us-national-unemployment-rate</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/9gi3ygssg3b71.gif\">BRRRRRRR</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.) Inflation is the Highest it has been in 31 Years</strong></p>\n\n<p>Jpow, our lord and savior, announced today inflation was above expectations of 5%. This has not happened since 1990. Hmm. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-government-and-politics-business-3539110d1ebe308e6aa11b3e1ca77c9e#:%7E:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP\">AP article</a>%20%E2%80%94%20The%20economy,at%20a%20congressional%20oversight%20hearing)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/htltaykaj3b71.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ac29899854ff5c947344c1634c14c0a0ba1c19f\">https://www.macrotrends.net/2497/historical-inflation-rate-by-year</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.) Housing Starts are Double What They Were in 2008, Nearing 2005 (Peak) Levels</strong></p>\n\n<p>Housing starts measure how many houses are being built. It is currently at around 1,500 a month. They are still recovering from 2005 but quickly approaching 2005 levels. More houses being built means that there is more supply flowing in.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q6rimkr2l3b71.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=669ba69ad13396b8b0ef5b9a2fa0a6e95df02c84\">https://www.macrotrends.net/1314/housing-starts-historical-chart</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.) Median House Prices are at $300,000, Up Nearly 100% From 2012</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although the housing crisis ended around 2009, the bottom for housing prices was in 2012. Since then, housing prices are well above their 2008 levels, even adjusted for inflation. This is a bad sign for the housing market. Having high housing prices means more debt, which leads to more defaults.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/da8skqgxl3b71.png?width=725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e630b436031fea554fe587ee362c8df29136d43\">https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>7.) 30 Year Fixed Mortgages are at an All Time Low</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is not necessarily a bad sign for the housing economy, but it means if we were to have a recession, it could be really bad. To fix recessions, the fed usually lowers interest rates, which is like turning the economy off and on again. It works most of the time. The grey bars in this picture are recessions. Notice how about halfway through each recession, the interest rates decrease, and the recession shortly ends.</p>\n\n<p>Interest rates are already incredibly low, so this may not be an option for the next recession without making interest rates negative. Having negative interest rates triggers more panic buying houses people can&#39;t afford, which results in more defaults. It will quickly become a chain reaction of hell.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/txtovqi5n3b71.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=245b5c47fe23bb69b6753ee2eb6b399dcc6e5e6a\">https://www.macrotrends.net/2604/30-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-chart</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This is my first DD, hopefully it&#39;s decent. I will be responding to comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojw4sq/why_the_housing_market_is_likely_fucked/","title":"Why the Housing Market is Likely Fucked","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-14T13:08:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-14 13:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a72a9fd5-0a48-5c20-9c10-7cbbf3a46af0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojw4sq/why_the_housing_market_is_likely_fucked/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojw4sq/why_the_housing_market_is_likely_fucked/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"SnipperV3","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SnipperV3","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SnipperV3","score":2760,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"なぜ住宅市場は壊滅的なのか","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: 2008年の住宅市場の暴落を引き起こした主要な兆候のほとんどすべてが、かつてないほど強力に復活している。\n2008年の住宅市場の暴落を引き起こした主要な兆候のほとんどすべてが、かつてないほど強力に復活している。住宅ローンの負債額は上限に達し、消費者の負債額は2倍になっています。\n木材先物は60％下落しているが、現物の木材は動いていない。\n失業率は2009年に比べてまだ50％高く、住宅着工件数は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么住房市场很可能被搞垮？","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: 导致2008年房地产市场崩溃的几乎所有关键迹象都是\n比以往任何时候都要强大。抵押贷款债务达到了顶峰，消费者债务是以往的2倍。\n抵押贷款债务达到了顶峰，消费者债务比以往任何时候都要高2倍，木材期货下跌了60%，但实物木材并没有移动。\n失业率仍然比2009年高50%，房屋开工率是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼住房市場很可能被搞垮？","the_new_excerpt":"TL;DR: 導致2008年房地產市場崩潰的幾乎所有關鍵跡象都是\n比以往任何時候都要強大。抵押貸款債務達到了頂峯，消費者債務是以往的2倍。\n抵押貸款債務達到了頂峯，消費者債務比以往任何時候都要高2倍，木材期貨下跌了60%，但實物木材並沒有移動。\n失業率仍然比2009年高50%，房屋開工率是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a8c8b022-dbb8-5527-8cf7-2c32624b9ff0","excerpt":"Hello everyone\n\nSome may remember the guide posted in the forums.
