&lt;p&gt;Stocks advanced firmly on Friday, with market participants continuing to balance better-than-expected corporate earnings amid rising inflation. The S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.75% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.05%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) broke a three day losing streak to finish 0.51% higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Friday’s close, the SPY closed the week 0.4% lower following volatility after the release of the October Consumer Price Index. However, after five consecutive weeks of gains, the market remains marginally below previous all-time highs. The QQQ closed the week 0.91% lower, while the DIA closed the week 0.97% lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a rise in inflation was expected, the pace of the increase surprised to the upside. If the pace of increase is not moderated soon, it carries meaningful implications for corporations, consumers, and the Federal Reserve. As input costs rise, companies will pass the increase in cost to consumers to preserve their bottom line, who will be forced to pay the higher prices. The Fed would then be forced to step in and rise interest rates, which will makes the cost to borrow money more expensive, which means people and companies will likely spend less, leading to a fall in demand for goods and services. A rise in interest rates would particularly hurt high P/E tech stocks that have been flying in the last two years, as these companies rely on borrowing to fund their aggressive expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the Federal Reserve and many economists have reaffirmed that the inflationary pressures are transitory, caused by pandemic-era disruptions in global trade and will eventually ease, albeit while likely settling at a higher level than had been present before the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabriela Santos, Global Market Strategist at JP Morgan, said “Inflation should moderate. We’re talking about settling at 2%, 2.5% over the course of the next 12 months. So we&amp;#39;re still talking about real wage gains, and that&amp;#39;s extremely supportive, certainly of people&amp;#39;s livelihoods, but also of consumption and hence the economy overall. We do expect a big re-acceleration in growth starting this quarter and throughout next year, [and] 5% average growth just over the next three quarters. So we would characterize this not as stagflation, but as reflation. And that difference is, reflation is actually quite good for earnings growth and quite good for the stock market, especially cyclical sectors.&amp;quot; So far, expectations are that the Fed will step in sometime mid-2022 to raise interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of Rivian (RIVN), which is backed by Ford and Amazon,  continue to be on absolute fire. The company, which is expected to lose $1.28 billion on no more than $1 million in revenue this quarter, now has a market cap of more than $100 billion. For perspective, they are now the fourth largest automaker in the world by market cap. I’m not a stickler for valuation, but this is absolute insanity and unsustainable. The company has not started production and is already priced to perfection, which they are bound to hit a snag with. I don’t think this price is sustainable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The University of Michigan’s closely monitored Consumer Sentiment survey showed the consumer sentiment index decreased to 66.8 from 71.7 in October, missing estimates of 72.5. Waning confidence reflects “ an escalating inflation rate and the growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation,” Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Snap (SNAP) investor sued the social media company alleging it downplayed how Apple’s (AAPL) change in privacy would affect revenue. Remember, the stock plummeted 25% after an earnings miss, citing Apple’s changes as hampering ad revenue. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After more than a decade of explosive growth, China&amp;#39;s Singles&amp;#39; Day, the world&amp;#39;s biggest online shopping fest, is losing its gloss and bracing for more modest growth in coming years, hurt by a slower economy and tighter regulatory scrutiny. Alibaba (BABA) said on Friday its sales - or gross merchandise value (GMV) - during the 11 day event grew 8.5%, the slowest rate ever and the first time it came under double-digits growth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it rejected an exchange-traded fund from VanEck that would have tracked Bitc… spot prices directly. This would have stood in contrast to the ProShares ETF (BITO), which was approved and which only tracks futures rather than prices directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I followed the GameStoo saga earlier this year and recently started looking again at the two big subreddits supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my understanding, the theory goes that the shorts never actually sold their positions (because they would have gone bankrupt), but instead used all sorts of trickery to delay and avoid. Some ppl, have caught on to this and are determined to hold the stock such that when the chickens come home to roost and the shorts are forced to close, will trigger, they’ll be able to skyrocket the price. I’ve seen claims that a single share could be worth millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course sounds fantastical and far-fetched but would someone mind explaining how seemingly so many ppl have adopted this belief and are all-in on a once hated retail store? IE where are they wrong in their analysis? Is it just a case of the human factor not being realized; that once the price jumps a bit, ppl will start to sell, so the idea of holding into the 1000s plus is unrealistic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, announced a partnership that will allow customers to integrate Workplace with Microsoft Teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership between Meta and Microsoft brings together two rivals that compete in the market of enterprise communication software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership could prove most beneficial to Meta, whose Workplace service lags drastically behind its competitors in terms of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a good partnership news that will benefit both companies. Microsoft teams is gaining more marketshare as it integrates into other softwares. The partnership could prove most beneficial to Meta as teams could help to boost its Workplace enterprise social network software users. Both stocks should be in the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these are all micro-level symptoms of a macro-level problem. Don&amp;#39;t miss the forest for the trees. Journalists need to write something new every day (or every hour it seems), even if there isn&amp;#39;t anything new to say. Which leads to a lot of noise that clouds your mind from making sense of what is really happening in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, the problem is clear: governments overdid it with stimulus. Unlike the 2008 Global Financial Crisis where policymakers did too little and acted too slow, this time around governments decided to err on the side of doing too much too quickly. If you look at consumer spending on FRED, it didn&amp;#39;t just fully recovery from the 2020 shock, it&amp;#39;s arguably on a stronger trajectory than it otherwise would be without the pandemic! At the same time, unemployment is still high and labor force participation is dreadfully low! The Fed created such a tremendous wealth effect, people are earning multiple years worth of stock market returns in the span of months. I&amp;#39;m not surprised many people are taking career breaks or retiring early. So why do we have red hot inflation? Because we&amp;#39;re printing more money and making less things, it&amp;#39;s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inflation problem highlights how difficult it is to be a policymaker. On one hand, you don&amp;#39;t want to under spend and risk seeing long-term economic scarring, but if you stimulate too much, you risk fueling inflation as well as asset price bubbles. The other factor at play is the politicization of economic policy. You&amp;#39;re everyone&amp;#39;s favorite politician when you&amp;#39;re fueling spending, but it&amp;#39;s hard to get reelected when you advocate for cutbacks. Prudent policymaking requires spending when times are bad, and building reserves when times are good - politicians have forgot about the latter half of that equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like why wouldn&amp;#39;t you just buy or hold something? What advantage do options or futures give you over just traditional investing? I get things like margin or leverage as in riskily buying more than you can afford but I just don&amp;#39;t get what the point or how options or futures work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, options sounds like ok I&amp;#39;ll buy the right to buy a stock at this price, if it goes down I just won&amp;#39;t fulfill the obligation because I don&amp;#39;t have to and if it goes up then sure I&amp;#39;ll fulfill the contract. Again, that&amp;#39;s definitely not right because that would just be an infinite money glitch because you would always never take the option if it&amp;#39;s going down and always take it if it goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures makes a little more sense because you have to oblige the contract. But then why wouldn&amp;#39;t you just buy something normally? What&amp;#39;s the benefit of buying at a set time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR, genuinely have no idea how options/futures work and what their point is, and I probably sound really dumb but if someone can explain in a way that makes sense I would really appreciate that, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

That’s 32% more than General Motors (GM) is worth, and 47% more than Ford (F). Rivian has never sold a vehicle until this year. GM sells around 7 million vehicles per year; Ford, 4 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you add up the market value of Tesla (TSLA), Rivian, and 5 other startups including Lucid (LCID), Nikola (NKLA), Fisker (FSR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE) and Workhorse (WKHS), their combined capitalization is nearly $1.3 trillion. Nine of the world’s biggest automakers—GM, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler-Benz—are only worth $845 billion. So those 9 giant automakers are worth 34% less than 7 fledgling EV manufacturers. As for sales, the established manufacturers outsell the EV upstarts 100 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market now seems to view &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-ceo-sees-annual-production-144553789.html&quot;&gt;Rivian&lt;/a&gt; as a Tesla-in-the-making, especially since it already has backing from Amazon and Ford. By focusing on sport pickups and delivery vans, Rivian has one foot in consumer vehicles and the other in commercial applications, a shrewd mix that lets the company spread its bets on a trend that is already a revolution in ground transportation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth.&lt;/strong&gt; In market terms, investors consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-is-not-enough-engine-no-1-bets-on-gm-white-paper-details-electric-vehicle-landscape-124811083.html&quot;&gt;EV newcomers&lt;/a&gt; such as Tesla and Rivian to be growth and technology companies with tons of upside potential. Traditional automakers are industrial concerns capable of incremental growth, at best. While virtually every big automaker is developing EV technology, the old ones won’t attain nearly the same rapid growth as the new ones will. That’s because they have massive investments in internal-combustion engines, or ICE—a.k.a. gas-and diesel-powered cars—that will decline as the new EV technology ramps up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM, for instance, sold 202,000 EVs in 2020, which was third most of any automaker, behind Tesla and Volkswagen. But for GM the technology of the future represented just 3% of all sales. The other 97% were legacy ICE vehicles likely to decline as a share of the overall market for years to come. At Tesla, 100% of sales were EVs, with no legacy business to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new technology is where the growth is. Tesla’s revenue growth rate during the last two years has been 39%, according to S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ. GM’s has been a negative 5%. Pandemic disruptions have been a factor in both company’s performance, but the trend was the same before the pandemic. GM still makes a lot of money selling high-margin pickups and SUVs, but investors view that as a business that could someday dwindle to no profit at all. Electrics, by contrast, will only get more profitable as costs drop, technology advances and more people buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional carmakers such as GM and Ford argue that the profitability of existing lineups gives them an advantage because they have in-house funding for new EV technology. But startups haven’t needed in-house funding because capital markets have been a ready source of money. “Capital for EV [manufacturers] is widely available and cheap in current market conditions, so we believe momentum/support for many of the stocks will persist,” analyst John Murphy of Bank of America wrote in a recent research note. “As has proven the case for Tesla over the past decade, the higher the upward spiral of stock, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nvidia Stock Gets a 49% Price Target Boost Before Earnings. Why Analysts Are Bullish.&lt;br/&gt;
 Analysts led by Rick Schafer at Oppenheimer reiterated their Outperform rating on Nvidia stock and raised their target price on the shares by 49% to $350 from $235.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meanwhile, Christopher Rolland at Susquehanna reiterated his Positive rating on Nvidia stock and hiked his target price to $360 from $250. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just me or do these guys just raise their prise targets as the stock soars so their performance on websites like tipranks doesn&amp;#39;t suffer? Nothing about nvidia&amp;#39;s performance has changed this quarter that would suddenly warrant an increase of nvidia&amp;#39;s market cap by 300 billion dollars. I think price targets are an important tool, especially for retail investors, but lately these guys seem to just make it up as they go. At $350b nvidia is a 900b company on 10b of forward net earnings. That&amp;#39;s just bonkers and these guys seem to base their price targets on how far they think the current bull market can inflate the ever increasing sentiment instead of what the stock is fundamentally worth.&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#39;ve been attaching unique IDs to items for thousands of years. I think people will soon figure out that not everything needs to be on the blockchain and that NFT marketplaces would be better suited on a centralized server, not Ethereum.   When you own an NFT, you don&amp;#39;t own the legal rights to the JPEG, nor do you even own a JPEG. You are really just buying a shitcoin that has a link to a JPEG URL. In ten years time all their NFTs will be deleted 404 pages and all you will have is a worthless shitcoin. There&amp;#39;s also a lot of problems with NFTs regarding intellectual property theft, as people can auction off property they have no legal right to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is merit to a marketplace of property though. There isn&amp;#39;t a regulated exchange for collectables in America. We have the NYSE for stocks, CME for commodities, but we don&amp;#39;t have one to trade collectable/non fungible items. Because such a thing doesn&amp;#39;t exist, blockchain based marketplaces are filling the void for that niche in the meantime. I think the preferred medium is a regulated exchange where real people are KYC&amp;#39;d and vetted before pushing an auction to sale. The obvious advantage of it is that governments will recognize property rights of the sales. You can still settle all of the transactions digitally, but it will take place on centralized servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market finished mixed on Thursday, as market participants continue to grapple with the implication of the latest inflation report and third-quarter earnings, which are showing signs of slowing down as it winds down. The S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) rose after two consecutive down days, as tech stocks made a comeback, closing 0.04% and 0.28% higher, led by a rebound in technology stocks, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.44% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.8% higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a slow news days due to it being Veteran’s Day holiday in the US, market participants continue to digest the Consumer Price Index released tomorrow, which showed prices of consumer good surging 6.2%.  in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Luzzetti, Chief US Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “This [the CPI report] is certainly telling us, I think, that price pressures are more persistent. They are broader. They are not just narrowly focused on those categories, whether it&amp;#39;s autos and the supply-constrained items. And it&amp;#39;s going to last longer than expected. We do think that the Fed is going to have to raise rates next year. They&amp;#39;ve signaled that they&amp;#39;re going to taper through the middle of the year, and that&amp;#39;s our baseline at this point. But if you continue to see price pressures like this over the coming months and more persistent, it may cause them to have to act earlier than expected.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Toyota says large parts of the world are not ready for EVs and committed $240 million to building a hybrid car parts plant in West Virginia. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Mills Inc is considering the sale of its soup brand Progresso and ready-to-eat meals label Helper for $3 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings expects Beijing to allow &amp;#39;metaverse&amp;#39; virtual environment services, now the talk of Silicon Valley, to operate in China - provided they fall in line with Chinese rules. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a lot of technologies that&amp;#39;s related to the development of games as well as for the metaverse,&amp;quot; Tencent president Martin Lau told analysts on a call peppered with questions about the metaverse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google lost an appeal against a 2.42-billion-euro ($2.8-billion) European antitrust decision on Wednesday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unity Software (U) buy special effects company Weta Digital for $1.3 billion. The studio, founded by Peter Jackson, was responsible for special effects in Avatar and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people talk about low growth periods like post tech bubble 2000’s, or stagflation during the 70’s. This is often talked about as a period where “the market remains flat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But during those periods, aren’t companies (and index funds) still paying dividends? Seems to me that you’ll have growth on the way back up as an existing asset holder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence why it’s important to stay the course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the question makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the dip justify? Most will agree: heck no&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s just how the current market is operating. Miss earnings and you’ll get killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe these companies that are losing half their valuation from missed earnings are severely undervalued and will rebound in due time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe $PSFE will rebound much easier than most other beaten down stock because it was previously a spac traded publicly at $10. Institutional buyers got in at this price and now we’re 60% down from there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s trading at a low $4 penny stock range which could be appealing to retail investors. &lt;/p&gt;
