If you do not trust me I implore you to do the research yourself.</p>\n\n<p>I have spent the past days scouring over public information on business acquisitions, art sales, news articles, and stock trends. I have shown a clear pattern of manipulative and insider trading tactics that are being used on all sectors of free trading markets, including the stock market, the art market, and collectable items market. These tactics specifically point to Kenneth Griffin of Citadel and Steven Cohen of Point72 as two of the main perpetrators. I used reputable sources to back up my claims. I promise I am not a conspiracy theorist, nor strive to validate the legitimacy of any conspiracy theories, nor push any political agenda. This is just what the numbers and facts point to.</p>\n\n<p>My full report, which is insanely long with my own exposition, can be found in my profile split over 3 posts. I recommend starting with part 3. I know GameStop gets a bad rep, but it was the perfect company to prove this on. It is not limited to just video games though, collectable shoes, hand purses, NFTs, and almost any auctionable item is being price spiked by hedge fund managers to create a frenzy of buying and selling items for higher than their actual market value. These hedge fund managers profit off of the sales by personally owning multiple companies that facilitate these types of trades.</p>\n\n<p>Short version related to GME = Hedge funds short GameStop stock while simultaneously pumping the prices of collector video games and trading cards. This rises the price of used games and trading cards in general. Hedge fund managers personally purchased Collectors Universe, along with Weta Games, to sell used video games and trading cards at arbitrary appraised prices. The plan was for GameStop to fail so that they can have easier entry into this market. </p>\n\n<p>Short version related to Art/NFTs = A clear pattern of market manipulation is present in the art market by the same hedge fund managers. Pre-agreed upon record breaking prices are bought and sold at auctions, for the purpose of raising the overall price of art. This increased price benefits the auction houses, which have established business relationships with the hedge fund managers. It also makes it a more lucrative market for money laundering.</p>\n\n<p>I will not give out financial advice, but I think it is imperative that you take a hard look at the legitimacy and state of our trading markets today. I want you to be safe out there. I want our markets to be free.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Reddit has also been actively removing my posts and comments.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ot9bnq/research_and_auditing_proves_market_manipulation/","title":"Research and auditing proves market manipulation across all sectors, with evidence to support it.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-29T07:21:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-29 07:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"cab0a44e-c692-5a7a-8231-d2bd5df21700","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ot9bnq/research_and_auditing_proves_market_manipulation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ot9bnq/research_and_auditing_proves_market_manipulation/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Matador3364","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Matador3364","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Matador3364","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"調査や監査により、あらゆる分野で市場操作が行われていることが証拠として証明されています。","the_new_excerpt":"一人でも多くの人にこのことを伝えなければならないという道義的な義務があると思っています。\nと思っています。もし、私を信じられないのであれば、ご自分で調査していただきたいと思います。\n\n私はこの数日間、企業買収、美術品販売、ニュース記事などの\n企業買収、美術品販売、ニュース記事、株式動向などの公開情報を調べました。私が示したのは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"研究和审计证明了所有部门的市场操纵行为，并有证据支持。","the_new_excerpt":"我觉得我有道义上的义务与尽可能多的人分享这一点。\n尽可能多的人分享。如果你不相信我，我恳请你自己做研究。\n\n在过去的几天里，我花了很多时间搜寻关于商业的公共信息。\n收购、艺术品销售、新闻报道和股票趋势的公开信息。我已经展示了一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"研究和審計證明了所有部門的市場操縱行爲，並有證據支持。","the_new_excerpt":"我覺得我有道義上的義務與儘可能多的人分享這一點。\n儘可能多的人分享。如果你不相信我，我懇請你自己做研究。\n\n在過去的幾天裏，我花了很多時間搜尋關於商業的公共信息。\n收購、藝術品銷售、新聞報道和股票趨勢的公開信息。我已經展示了一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-46686ac0-b3db-52a3-86ca-7d1231f1bbf5","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/qualcomm-qcom-earnings-q3-2021.html\n\nEPS: $1.92 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.68 per share as expected by analysts,\naccording to Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue: $8.00 billion, adjusted, vs. $7.58 billion as expected by analysts,\naccording to Refinitiv.\n\nThe stock price is still …","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/otin9r/qualcomm_shares_rise_as_revenue_pops_63_driven_by/","title":"Qualcomm shares rise as revenue pops 63% driven by chip sales","date":"July 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"クアルコム社、チップ販売により売上高が63%増加し、株価が上昇","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/qualcomm-qcom-earnings-q3-2021.html\n\nEPS：1株当たり1.92ドル（調整後）、アナリスト予想1.68ドルに対して。\nリフィニティブ社調べ。\n\n売上高：調整後80億ドル（アナリスト予想75.8億ドル）。\nRefinitiv社調べ。\n\n株価はまだ ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"高通公司股价上涨，在芯片销售的推动下，营收爆增63%。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/qualcomm-qcom-earnings-q3-2021.html\n\nEPS：调整后每股1.92美元，而分析师预期为每股1.68美元。\n据Refinitiv报道。\n\n收入：调整后为80.0亿美元，而分析师预期为75.8亿美元。\n根据Refinitiv的数据。\n\n股价仍然是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"高通公司股價上漲，在芯片銷售的推動下，營收爆增63%。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/qualcomm-qcom-earnings-q3-2021.html\n\nEPS：調整後每股1.92美元，而分析師預期爲每股1.68美元。\n據Refinitiv報道。\n\n收入：調整後爲80.0億美元，而分析師預期爲75.8億美元。\n根據Refinitiv的數據。\n\n股價仍然是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-8805f319-0fa9-56da-8173-18711df27f45","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otind7/fb_is_undervalued_they_say_cant_go_wrong_with/","title":"FB is undervalued they say, can't go wrong with facebook they say","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 29, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FBは過小評価されていると言われていますが、facebookで間違ったことはできません。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"他们说，FB的价值被低估了，他们说Facebook不会出错","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"他們說，FB的價值被低估了，他們說Facebook不會出錯","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-cab0a44e-c692-5a7a-8231-d2bd5df21700","previousId":"RedditPost-46686ac0-b3db-52a3-86ca-7d1231f1bbf5","nextId":"RedditPost-8805f319-0fa9-56da-8173-18711df27f45","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ot9bnq/research_and_auditing_proves_market_manipulation/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
