I&#39;ve incorporated much of the discussion and feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a recap of why I believe whole-heartedly in Tellurian and the potential growth in this company. As full disclosure and being transparent,  I currently hold 117k shares and calls Jan 22 $3, $5, $10, $15 sprinkled in. I began buying Tell at the COVID crash in the .70s. I&#39;ve wheeled options while rolling money into shares as I&#39;ve gone. It&#39;s been an emotional roller coaster (especially October dips) In one year I started with 60k YOLO and now I&#39;m at 417k at Friday&#39;s close. Even with the recent growth in the last 30 days, this is just the beginning for Tell. I&#39;m holding for the long term at least until 2024 when Phase 1 construction is completed.</p>\n\n<p>I could make this post a college essay, but I&#39;ll aim to keep it short and to the point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is Tellurian?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tellurian is an LNG (liquid natural gas) provider/exporter that will be a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for sourcing, a pipeline for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic HH prices as they&#39;ll be selling on JKM.</p>\n\n<p>Driftwood has received federal permits and is 30% engineered. Capital will be funded by equity partners, most likely long-term buyers of future LNG. The equity partner will receive future contracts for at-cost LNG in exchange for the front load of capital. Current partners already include Total and GE. $5B capital is needed for the Final Investment Decision.</p>\n\n<p>Link to Tell&#39;s latest presentation: <a href=\"https://www.tellurianinc.com/news-and-presentations/new-corporate-presentation-2/corporate-presentation_tellurian_january-2021_final/\">https://www.tellurianinc.com/news-and-presentations/new-corporate-presentation-2/corporate-presentation_tellurian_january-2021_final/</a></p>\n\n<p>The Management team is comprised of heavy hitters and LNG legends including the LNG godfather Charif Souki who was the founder of Cheniere Energy.  If they can do it once, they can do it again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>LNG</strong></p>\n\n<p>Over the next decade, there will be a large difference in demand to supply for LNG as countries transition from Coal/Nuclear to &quot;cleaner renewable&quot; sources. Green Energy is forecasted to be 74% of energy generation. For renewables, Solar/Wind is forecasted at 10%-15% of the renewable sources with Bio Mass as 70%-80%. In addition to the domestic shortage of natural gas with the number of offshore rigs shutdown during COVID. Even if they turned them on, it would be 1-2 years before production would be online again.  Tell will be exporting to Asian LNG market (JKM) and European LNG market (TTF) where local markets for natural gas extraction are limited and will rely on imports from providers such as Tell.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Natural%20Gas.pdf\">https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Natural%20Gas.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>LNG will be the source for heat/cooling as it will be used for power generation including all those EVs and Tesla&#39;s that need to charge from the grid.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Electricity.pdf\">https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2020%20Electricity.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Give Planet of the Humans documentary a watch. It&#39;s on Youtube and Prime for free I think. Good explanation of LNG&#39;s role over the next 25 years.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Humans\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Humans</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Targets</strong></p>\n\n<p>At max capacity, Tell valuation would be 100B made by Souki the chairman. Break down the math from there. Tell will retain 40% of capacity for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>2021 - February = $4-$6 (1B valuation / 329M shares)</p>\n\n<p>2021 - March/April = $8-$12 - Deals announced gap up (3B valuation / 329M shares)</p>\n\n<p>2021 - May/June or FID announced = $15-$20 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 329M shares)</p>\n\n<p>2023 = $45 at Phase 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 329M shares). Note: I would expect 1 year delay to 2024 due to hurricanes or natural events.</p>\n\n<p>Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company&#39;s valuations could get frothy, much like early to mid-2000s with oil peaks.</p>\n\n<p>Future: 40% capacity equals $80 a share</p>\n\n<p>Future: 100% capacity equals $130 a share</p>\n\n<p>Max would be 100B valuation / 329M shares at $300. Equity partners could comprise 40%-60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l4822k/tell_dd_long_term_outlook_and_value_proposition/","title":"$Tell DD Long Term Outlook and Value Proposition","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T10:10:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 10:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"344f44de-8de5-505e-a076-3e94cbffd2e1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l4822k/tell_dd_long_term_outlook_and_value_proposition/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l4822k/tell_dd_long_term_outlook_and_value_proposition/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"V3Capital","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/V3Capital","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"V3Capital","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$Tell DD长期展望和价值主张。","the_new_excerpt":"编辑：谢谢大家的意见。我已经把很多讨论的内容纳入了\n和反馈。\n\n以下是我全心全意相信Tellurian的原因，以及它的潜力。\n在这家公司的成长。为了充分披露和透明，我目前\n持有11.7万股，看涨1月22日3元、5元、10元、...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$Tell DD長期展望和價值主張。","the_new_excerpt":"編輯：謝謝大家的意見。我已經把很多討論的內容納入了\n和反饋。\n\n以下是我全心全意相信Tellurian的原因，以及它的潛力。\n在這家公司的成長。爲了充分披露和透明，我目前\n持有11.7萬股，看漲1月22日3元、5元、10元、...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c3d512c2-d054-5e41-b81d-b4f88b426738","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4fhxz/a_few_of_the_memes_of_past_present_would_like_to/","title":"A few of the memes of past & present would like to formally congratulate GME gang","date":"January 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"过去和现在的一些备忘录要正式祝贺GME帮。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"過去和現在的一些備忘錄要正式祝賀GME幫。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-f6d4defc-fbf6-587a-93fe-04dddea7fd6b","excerpt":"Your daily trading discussion thread.
