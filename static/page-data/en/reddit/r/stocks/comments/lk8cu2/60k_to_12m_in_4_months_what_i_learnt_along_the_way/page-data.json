There should be no emotional attachment to stocks, do not make excuses for the stocks you hold or are planning to buy. I come out with a mental thesis and anti-thesis For &amp; Against for every move I make</li>\n<li>There are 4 main things that move stocks, Fundamentals, FOMO, Social Hype &amp; ARK Invest. Ideally, the stocks you pick should have as many of the above as possible with good catalysts in the pipeline.</li>\n<li>Diversification is for hedge fund, really rich people, or fools. Reason being your #2 pick will always have something weaker than your #1, and by the time you get down to #10, you might be simply buying a stock simply because you think you have the need to diversify</li>\n<li>Be very careful of WSB pumps on stocks with almost 0 fundamentals. Only play with money you can lose and if you think you&#39;re in early</li>\n<li>Know your strengths, I tried my hands at &quot;day-trading&quot;, and came to the conclusion that I&#39;m no day      trader. I stick purely to what works for me now.</li>\n<li>Social media (reddit, stock twits, youtube etc) is a good way to get info or tickets, but ALWAYS do your own DD. Never buy anything you are not confident in</li>\n<li>Buy on red days when people are fearful. There is nothing I love more than a red day when you are confident in your picks.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t bother with dividend plays and mega caps, those are too slow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My goal? Turn my current $1.2m into $10m so I can buy my parents a nice home and car. Living very frugally meanwhile.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current positions</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>75% Portfolio - Nano Dimensions</li>\n<li>25% Portfolio - Cinedigm</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Looking for 50:50 once NN-DM burst after their acquisitions.
