It has actually performed slightly better than the S and P 500. How can a company that has about the same revenue from 10 years ago still compete with SPY during a bull market? The answer is the valuation of the stock through its earnings and cash flow. The PE ratio and Price to Free Cash Flow are both under 20 right now, just like they were 10 years ago. This has allowed the company to purchase back almost 50% of their shares during this time.   </p>\n\n<p>Looking to the future, Ebay is not going to grow at a fast pace, but literally any growth, even a few percent annualized would have great upside potential for the stock considering it was able to perform well with no growth over and 10 year period and still remain reasonably valued. While the 10 year revenue growth is roughly at 0, the past 5 year growth is at about 5%, and analysts are predicting modest revenue growth over at least the next 5 year period. </p>\n\n<p>I ran 3 models based on 0%, 2%, and 4% revenue growth per year over the next 7 years to determine what a fair value would be today for the stock to expect a 9 percent return per year. My assumptions included 8% buyback of shares per year, which is in between their 10 and 5 year average of 7-12 percent. I kept their FCF as % of Rev at the historic average of 24%. And I assumed a future PE in 7 years of 15 and a future P/FCF of 19. </p>\n\n<p>At 0 percent revenue growth, I got a fair value of about $90-100. At 2 percent revenue growth I got a fair value of $100 to 110. And at 4 percent I got $115-120. Based on these numbers the stock is undervalued or at the very least near fair value if you want to be more conservative. </p>\n\n<p>As a disclaimer, while my assumptions are based on conservative historic performance of the last 10 years and future analyst estimates, they could not materialize in the future. But I do think that the upside potential is much better than the downside potential.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oylxf2/ebay_stock_is_a_perfect_example_of_why_valuation/","title":"Ebay stock is a perfect example of why valuation does matter over the long term.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-06T05:18:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-06 05:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"14a56504-aba9-5d8f-b53a-e4d397caf1af","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oylxf2/ebay_stock_is_a_perfect_example_of_why_valuation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oylxf2/ebay_stock_is_a_perfect_example_of_why_valuation/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Hayden97","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hayden97","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Hayden97","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Ebay社の株式は、長期的にはバリュエーションが重要であることを示す完璧な例です。","the_new_excerpt":"Ebayは過去10年間、収益の伸びがありませんでした。しかし、株価は\n過去10年間の株価はどうだったでしょうか？実際には、S＆P500よりも若干良いパフォーマンスをしています。\nS＆P500よりもわずかに優れています。10年前とほぼ同じ収益を上げている会社が、どうして\n10年前とほぼ同じ収益の会社が、強気の市場でSPYと競争することができるでしょうか？その答えは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Ebay股票是一个完美的例子，说明为什么长期来看估值确实很重要。","the_new_excerpt":"在过去10年里，易趣网的收入没有任何增长。但该股在过去10年\n在过去10年的表现如何？它的表现实际上略好于\nS和P 500指数。一家收入与10年前差不多的公司怎么可能\n在牛市中仍能与SPY竞争？答案是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Ebay股票是一個完美的例子，說明爲什麼長期來看估值確實很重要。","the_new_excerpt":"在過去10年裏，易趣網的收入沒有任何增長。但該股在過去10年\n在過去10年的表現如何？它的表現實際上略好於\nS和P 500指數。一家收入與10年前差不多的公司怎麼可能\n在牛市中仍能與SPY競爭？答案是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1423460920446046209","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1423460920446046209","title":"lSRAEL: 95% OF SEVERE COVID PATIENTS VACCINATED, 85-90% OF HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE  BREAKTHROUGHS  **\nhttps://t.co/dZxn25k8Jr","date":"August 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"イスラエル：重症感染者の95％がワクチン接種を受け、入院の85～90％が重症感染者。\nhttps://t.co/dZxn25k8Jr","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"以色列：95%的重症患者接受了疫苗接种，85-90%的住院患者为破伤风患者 ** 。\nhttps://t.co/dZxn25k8Jr","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"以色列：95%的重症患者接受了疫苗接種，85-90%的住院患者爲破傷風患者 ** 。\nhttps://t.co/dZxn25k8Jr","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-388be653-e018-5926-af51-937a5a53005a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/oyjefi/growing_at_a_few_percent_a_year_is_what_were_all/","title":"\"Growing at a few percent a year is what we're all used to.
