I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!</p>\n\n<p>During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s talk about their evaluation…</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.</li>\n<li>Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.</li>\n<li>Nvidia&#39;s current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia&#39;s plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EBITDA</strong>, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qx1l1a/i_analyzed_nvda_so_you_dont_have_to/","title":"I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-19T02:08:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-19 02:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qx1l1a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qx1l1a/i_analyzed_nvda_so_you_dont_have_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qx1l1a/i_analyzed_nvda_so_you_dont_have_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Jodyhighrolex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jodyhighrolex","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Jodyhighrolex","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"NVDAを分析してみました。","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。今日はNVDA、通称Nvidiaの分析を行います。I\nまた、他の企業の分析も行っています。私のプロフィールをご覧ください。\n私のプロフィールをご覧ください。ご存知ない方もいらっしゃるかもしれませんが、Nvidiaはアメリカに本拠地を置く企業です。\nグラフィックス、プロセッシングユニット、チップを設計しているアメリカの会社です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我分析了$NVDA，所以你不必去分析。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，今天我将分析$NVDA，也就是Nvidia。I\n也对其他公司进行了分析。请随时查看\n在我的个人资料中! 对于那些不知道的人来说，Nvidia是一家位于美国的公司。\n美国，设计图形、处理单元和芯片。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我分析了$NVDA，所以你不必去分析。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，今天我將分析$NVDA，也就是Nvidia。I\n也對其他公司進行了分析。請隨時查看\n在我的個人資料中! 對於那些不知道的人來說，Nvidia是一家位於美國的公司。\n美國，設計圖形、處理單元和芯片。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qww4qv","excerpt":"Before I start, letting you know I have no short positions on any company\nwhatsoever.
