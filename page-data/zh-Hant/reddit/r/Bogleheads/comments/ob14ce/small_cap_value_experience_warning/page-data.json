I wanted to share my experience with it for those considering taking the plunge.</p>\n\n<p>During the 2008 and More recently the Covid corrections, I had absolutely no fear that the markets would eventually recover. I just kept putting money into the market with every paycheck according to my investment plan. In both cases my diligence paid off and I was able to experience significant return. I didn’t lose any sleep and thought my risk tolerance was very high.</p>\n\n<p>Given the recent discussions about small cap value, I was excited to add it to my portfolio. I thought I wouldn’t mind the increased risk as I felt I still had many years from retirement. At first it was great. it was making good returns and seemed to offer some diversification from VT. It would go down some days when VT was up and up some days VT was down. However, I then experienced a sell off week where it fell almost 9% in a single week for no reason. It caused me anxiety for no reason. I was researching the persistence of the small cap and value factors and doubting myself given the past decade of underperformance. I was also constantly trying to figure out the optimal ratio for my portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to wait until it returned to a more reasonable level and then sold my position yesterday. I returned to my portfolio of 100% VT and slept like a baby last night.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately my experience did not cost me anything as the trades were made in my Roth IRA and I was able to get out at a similar gain as VT made during the period. Just thought I’d share my experience with it for those interested in the value premium. It does make a lot of sense but is not worth the additional risk and sleepless nights for me.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ob14ce/small_cap_value_experience_warning/","title":"Small Cap Value Experience Warning","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"July 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-01T01:12:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-01 01:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c039d86d-d799-59e9-a652-dae942450887","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ob14ce/small_cap_value_experience_warning/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ob14ce/small_cap_value_experience_warning/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"Andrige3","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Andrige3","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Andrige3","score":36,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"スモール・キャップ・バリュー・エクスペリエンス・ワーニング","the_new_excerpt":"ボーグルヘッズ\n\n最近、スモール・キャップ・バリューへの関心が高まっています。\nこのサブのBen Felixに興味を持ったからです。私の経験をお伝えしたいと思います。\n踏み出そうと考えている人のために、私の経験を紹介したいと思います。\n\n2008年、そして最近のCovidの修正の間、私は全く恐れていませんでした。\n恐れていませんでした...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"小盘股价值经验警告","the_new_excerpt":"Bogleheads。\n\n我看到最近有很多人对小盘股价值感兴趣，比如由于\n对本-菲利克斯的兴趣。我想和大家分享我在这方面的经验\n那些正在考虑投资的人。\n\n在2008年和最近的Covid修正期间，我完全不担心\n担心...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"小盤股價值經驗警告","the_new_excerpt":"Bogleheads。\n\n我看到最近有很多人對小盤股價值感興趣，比如由於\n對本-菲利克斯的興趣。我想和大家分享我在這方面的經驗\n那些正在考慮投資的人。\n\n在2008年和最近的Covid修正期間，我完全不擔心\n擔心...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ca4470f9-519b-55c9-916e-2b5acd56ebf8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ob518m/when_you_see_green_within_minutes_of_buying/","title":"When you see green within minutes of buying. 🤑📈","date":"June 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"買って数分で緑が見えてきたら 🤑📈","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"当你在购买后几分钟内看到绿色。🤑📈","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當你在購買後幾分鐘內看到綠色。🤑📈","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-bae26ef8-88f8-537f-8b39-cd61e5eee953","excerpt":"Your daily hype thread.
