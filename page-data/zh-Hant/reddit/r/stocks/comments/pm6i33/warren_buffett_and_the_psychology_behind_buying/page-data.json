Instead, he suggests looking for great companies and then go all in if the price is fair. Great companies you can hold for many many years. I think this is an amazing advice that I certainly adopted.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s a lot of psychology behind evaluating if a stock is at a fair price.  When I want to buy a new stock, I would be very critical of the price. I will look at all the metrics and compare it to other companies in its industry, etc. However, after I buy a stock, I&#39;d be much less critical. For example, let&#39;s say Shopify today traded at ATH around $1800. I&#39;d probably not buy the stock at it looks expensive and I might get it at a better price in the future. However, if I bought it a year ago at $900 I&#39;d probably keep holding it at $1800 cause I believe it&#39;s a great company that will keep growing.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring tax implications of holding vs selling (short vs long term gain), we can say that every time we decide to hold a stock we make a decision to buy it. Why do we more likely to hold than buy? I think that&#39;s because the psychology of making and losing money. If I buy Shopify at $1800 and tomorrow it goes down to $1600, I&#39;ll lose money. No one likes to lose money. If I bought it at $900 and it went to $1800 and then $1600, I&#39;m still happy with my return.</p>\n\n<p>I think another reason for holding is that it&#39;s easier. If you sell you need to find something else to invest in that you think will give you better returns. Once we found a company that has given us nice returns we&#39;re happy with, it&#39;s just easier to keep betting on it, even though it doesn&#39;t always work (winners keep winning until they don&#39;t).</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how you deal with the hold or sell decision? Do you often take short term profits and exit a position unlike Buffet&#39;s advice to hold for many years? Do you alway set stop losses to ensure your profit doesn&#39;t go below a certain price? etc.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pm6i33/warren_buffett_and_the_psychology_behind_buying/","title":"Warren Buffett and the psychology behind buying, holding, and selling","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-11T17:40:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-11 17:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pm6i33","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pm6i33/warren_buffett_and_the_psychology_behind_buying/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pm6i33/warren_buffett_and_the_psychology_behind_buying/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ravivg","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ravivg","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ravivg","score":180,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ウォーレン・バフェットと買い・持ち・売りの心理学","the_new_excerpt":"ウォーレン・バフェットは、自分の最大の失敗の一つは、最も安い株を探すことだと言っています。\n得ることができる最も安い株を探すことだと言っています。その代わりに、優れた企業を探して、価格が妥当であれば\n適正な価格であれば購入することを勧めています。偉大な企業は何年も持ち続けることができます。I\nこれは素晴らしいアドバイスだと思いますし、私もそう思います。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"沃伦-巴菲特和购买、持有和出售背后的心理学","the_new_excerpt":"沃伦-巴菲特曾经说过，他最大的错误之一是寻找最便宜的\n的股票。相反，他建议寻找伟大的公司，然后在价格低廉的情况下全力以赴。\n如果价格合理的话，就全额买入。伟大的公司你可以持有很多很多年。I\n我认为这是一个了不起的建议，我肯定会...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"沃倫-巴菲特和購買、持有和出售背後的心理學","the_new_excerpt":"沃倫-巴菲特曾經說過，他最大的錯誤之一是尋找最便宜的\n的股票。相反，他建議尋找偉大的公司，然後在價格低廉的情況下全力以赴。\n如果價格合理的話，就全額買入。偉大的公司你可以持有很多很多年。I\n我認爲這是一個了不起的建議，我肯定會...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pm8lew","excerpt":"He (56y/o M) sold all of his stocks first, then most of his funds, though he is\nkeeping my mom's 12 shares of Amazon and his own FCNTX fund, because he says\nit's been making him a lot of money, (even though it has a relatively high\nexpense ratio).
