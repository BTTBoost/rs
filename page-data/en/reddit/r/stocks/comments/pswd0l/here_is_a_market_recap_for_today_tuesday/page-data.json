If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrande’s lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor’s said, it was unlikely that Evergrande’s default would cause a credit crisis “by itself” but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, “Banks’ exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for China’s financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time.” </p>\n\n<p>In other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Wednesday. The monetary policy statement and subsequent press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday afternoon will lay out what the Fed thinks of the current state of the economy and potential signal when the Fed will begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. </p>\n\n<p>Julia Coronado, President of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said “I think on balance the Fed is still marching forward. They&#39;re going to tell us that they&#39;re about to taper this year, or their plan is still to taper this year. That sets up November or maybe December as a formal announcement. So this meeting is really not about doing anything, it&#39;s just about reminding us that the economy is making progress, the recovery is under way and the Fed is beginning a very gradual process of normalizing, as they like to say, monetary policy.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The policy decision will also come alongside an updated economic projection from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, including the first look at their expectations for 2024. Based on the central bank&#39;s latest projections from June, the FOMC&#39;s &quot;dot plot,&quot; or chart of interest rate expectations, suggested the median member expected two rate hikes by the end of 2023.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sorry no highlights again today</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.&quot;</em> -Eleanor Roosevelt</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pswd0l/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_tuesday/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, September 21, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-22T07:22:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-22 07:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pswd0l","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pswd0l/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_tuesday/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pswd0l/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_tuesday/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":56,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本日2021年9月21日（火）のマーケット・リカップをご紹介します。","the_new_excerpt":"サイコ・マーケット・リカップ - 2021年9月21日(火)\n\nこのレポートの投稿が遅れて申し訳ありません。\nしていました。\n\n市場参加者は、中国のEvergrande社からの影響を考慮している。\n市場参加者は、中国のEvergrandeからの影響を消化し続けており、今後の動向を気にしている。\n市場参加者は、中国のEvergrandeからの影響を消化し、不安を抱えたまま...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"以下是今天的市场回顾，2021年9月21日，星期二","the_new_excerpt":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年9月21日，星期二\n\n很抱歉推迟发布回顾，我的终端遇到了技术困难。\n我这边\n\n股市在另一个动荡的时段再次收低，因为市场参与者继续消化中国恒大的影响和\n市场参与者继续消化来自中国恒大的影响，并焦急地等待着中国经济的复苏。\n焦虑地等待着...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是今天的市場回顧，2021年9月21日，星期二","the_new_excerpt":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年9月21日，星期二\n\n很抱歉推遲發佈回顧，我的終端遇到了技術困難。\n我這邊\n\n股市在另一個動盪的時段再次收低，因爲市場參與者繼續消化中國恆大的影響和\n市場參與者繼續消化來自中國恆大的影響，並焦急地等待着中國經濟的復甦。\n焦慮地等待着...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pswbus","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pswbus/a_bear_bull_market/","title":"A bear bull market","date":"September 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ベア・ブル・マーケット","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"一个熊市牛市","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個熊市牛市","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-psu3gz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/psu3gz/ground_hog_day_for_wish_investors/","title":"Ground hog day for $WISH investors","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 22, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WISHの投資家にとってのグランドホッグデー","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"WISH投资者的土豪日","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"WISH投資者的土豪日","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pswd0l","previousId":"RedditPost-pswbus","nextId":"RedditPost-psu3gz","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pswd0l/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_tuesday/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
