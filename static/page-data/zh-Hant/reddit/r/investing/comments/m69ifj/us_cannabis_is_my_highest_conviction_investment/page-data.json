These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Market:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. </p></li>\n<li><p>Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>US Cannabis as an investor:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. </p></li>\n<li><p>The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Haven’t we already missed the boat?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. </p></li>\n<li><p>It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Canada vs USA</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. </p></li>\n<li><p>In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. </p></li>\n<li><p>Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. </p></li>\n<li><p>In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. </p></li>\n<li><p>Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. </p></li>\n<li><p>The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.</p></li>\n<li><p>As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Canada vs USA - The Numbers</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0\">Canadian LPs</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8\">US MSOs</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Who are these US cannabis companies?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Curaleaf:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.</li>\n<li>2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.</li>\n<li>Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY</li>\n<li>Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY</li>\n<li>Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA</li>\n<li>Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. </li>\n<li>Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.</li>\n<li>They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.</li>\n<li>Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019</li>\n<li>Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The bear cases</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.</p></li>\n<li><p>Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. </p></li>\n<li><p>In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.</p></li>\n<li><p>I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.</p></li>\n<li><p>Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.</p></li>\n<li><p>The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:</p></li>\n<li><p>The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. </p></li>\n<li><p>There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. </p></li>\n<li><p>Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. </p></li>\n<li><p>Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>My Strategy:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. </p></li>\n<li><p>I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and headwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Discloser:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m69ifj/us_cannabis_is_my_highest_conviction_investment/","title":"US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-16T17:18:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-16 17:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8743028d-e408-5416-8a51-3a535ed6b8a5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m69ifj/us_cannabis_is_my_highest_conviction_investment/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m69ifj/us_cannabis_is_my_highest_conviction_investment/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Tiaan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tiaan","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Tiaan","score":268,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"美国大麻是我未来3-5年信念最高的投资品(DD和分析)","the_new_excerpt":"总体概述\n\n * 我们目前正处于投资者需求在大麻领域得到证明的时刻。\n   板块，但该领域美国龙头企业的股票却在。\n   难以买入，而且与他们被炒作的加拿大人相比，价值被低估了。\n   同行。这些美国公司的资产负债率要强得多...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國大麻是我未來3-5年信念最高的投資品(DD和分析)","the_new_excerpt":"總體概述\n\n * 我們目前正處於投資者需求在大麻領域得到證明的時刻。\n   板塊，但該領域美國龍頭企業的股票卻在。\n   難以買入，而且與他們被炒作的加拿大人相比，價值被低估了。\n   同行。這些美國公司的資產負債率要強得多...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6ebf1fb1-e4e2-5c09-b38c-5b990c7f5326","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5nofh/gme_has_been_a_wild_ride_one_reason_i_want_it_to/","title":"GME has been a wild ride, one reason I want it to end.
