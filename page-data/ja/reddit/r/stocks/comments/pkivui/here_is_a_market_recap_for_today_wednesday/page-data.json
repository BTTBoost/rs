So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn&#39;t have the time</em></p>\n\n<p>Stocks fell today, extending the previous day’s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.</p>\n\n<p>Yung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, “We think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what’s going to support the market for the rest of the year.” </p>\n\n<p>The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly ⅓ of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month’s numbers. Here are the numbers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Change in non-farm payrolls:</strong> +235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July</li>\n<li><strong>Unemployment rate, August:</strong> 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July</li>\n<li><strong>Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:</strong> 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July </li>\n<li><strong>Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:</strong> 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>President Biden said of the report, “While I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we’ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.”</p>\n\n<p>Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” August was not the report they were looking for. </p>\n\n<p>In its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, “The deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.” </p>\n\n<p>In the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge\">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html\">https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, “While SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation” and suggested “as it falls behind competitors [Amazon] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind” (ouch).</p>\n\n<p>In response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.” SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 — hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.</li>\n<li>El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country’s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don’t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador</li>\n<li>Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure’s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion</li>\n<li>Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. </li>\n<li>Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car&#39;s battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight.
