Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Lowe’s (LOW), and Home Depot (HD) are set to release quarterly earnings this week, giving us more information into the state of consumer spending in the US. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected</li>\n<li>Core Retail Sales: +1.6%</li>\n<li>Manufacturing Production: +1.2%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. </p>\n\n<p>Matthew Shay, President of the National Retail Federation, said of the report, “Today’s numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping. We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books”.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, two of the largest retailers in the US, Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD), reported earnings today, with both companies demolishing earnings (though WMT stock did not react positively). Here are the numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Walmart (WMT)</strong> \n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue: $140.53 billion vs $135.60 billion expected </li>\n<li>Earnings per Share (EPS): $1.45 vs $1.40 expected</li>\n<li>Sames Store Sales: +9.2% vs +6.9% expected </li>\n<li>eCommerce Sales: +8% vs +1.9% expected </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Home Depot (HD)</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue: $36.82 billion vs $35.01 billion expected</li>\n<li>Earnings per Share (EPS): $3.92 vs $3.40 expected</li>\n<li>Same Store Sales: +6.1% vs 1.9% expected</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These reports came at the tail end of what has already been an exceptionally strong earnings season. As of Friday, 92% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results, and of these, 81% of them had reported better-than-expected earnings results, according to FactSet.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_111221.pdf\">https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_111221.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Somehow, someway, shares of Rivian (RIVN) keep rising after its blockbuster IPO, with the company now being the third largest auto manufacturer by market cap at roughly $150 billion despite barely completing any deliveries. This is, by far, the craziest valuation I’ve ever seen. </li>\n<li>The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that import prices rose 1.2% on a monthly basis in October, coming in well above the 0.4% rise for September. This was also above the 1.0% increase consensus economists expected for October, according to Bloomberg data.</li>\n<li>Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) are on fire after the company projected that its chipset business will average “midteens” revenue growth through its fiscal year 2024. That’s well above the 8% average contemplated by Wall Street’s current estimates.</li>\n<li>Netflix (NFLX) is set to release the highly anticipated sequel to Tiger King tomorrow. It seems like Netflix has been on an amazing roll as of late and now has a higher market cap than Disney (DIS)</li>\n<li>Lucid Motors (LCID) has now overtaken Ford Motors (F) in market cap</li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) is reportedly working to make its own in-house modem chip that allows wireless connection for iPhones by 2023. Qualcomm (QCOM), which currently supplies modem chips for all Apple devices, estimates Apple will self-supply 80% of modem chips by 2023. </li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with four target raises. Stock currently around $235\n\n<ul>\n<li>Citigroup from $282 to $290 at Buy</li>\n<li>Wedbush from $250 to $270 at Outperform</li>\n<li>Credit Suisse from $250 to $255 at Outperform</li>\n<li>Bank of America from $256 to $282 at Buy</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Datadog (DDOG) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $210 to $230 at Buy.
