This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It&#39;s a tricky game they&#39;re playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.</p>\n\n<p>As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I&#39;ve seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what&#39;s happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.</p>\n\n<p>Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is <strong>NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts</strong> for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy. When you&#39;re up it seems great, but it really has a negative effect on me.  I&#39;m forcing myself to work out, to get outside, get some sun, and focus onw what really matters in life.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone needs to chat - by all means shoot me a note. Until then - enjoy your Friday. Love the ones close to you. Try your best to view this in perspective - life is so much more than the value of your portfolio. And so are you.</p>\n\n<p>To the entire stock community - please know you&#39;re not alone. <strong>Life is beautiful in so many ways, all you need to do is find the right places to look. Your loved ones, your family, and those in your circle love the positive you</strong> - so let&#39;s work together to foster a community beyond memes and tendies, but honest and open truth about how we&#39;re feeling.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m8k0yn/on_red_days_take_a_moment_and_think_green_mental/","title":"On RED DAYS: Take a moment and think GREEN.
