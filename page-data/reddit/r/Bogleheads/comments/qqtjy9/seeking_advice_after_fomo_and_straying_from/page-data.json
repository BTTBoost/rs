Then I discovered a certain meme stock in Jan and made many multiples off my initial investment. I should have realized that I got lucky getting in early but I was stubborn and overconfident. I started doing research on other sectors and individual stocks, and decided to allocate 25% of my net worth in an actively managed strategy. That strategy did not work very well. I either didn’t have conviction and sold or had too much conviction to sell when there were “bad signs” that indicated trouble. As a result, my actively managed portfolio has underperformed VT by 10%. I am still up 57% for the year (thanks to the initial meme stock and some crypto). I suppose I should feel grateful that I am still positive for the year but I can’t help but feel like I have failed. </p>\n\n<p>At this point I want to sell everything and either go cash/DCA or go lump sum back into a broad market index fund. I have realized that it isn’t great for my mental health to obsess over my portfolio like this.  </p>\n\n<p>I see posts from people who have gotten insanely rich off this bull run and it makes me feel FOMO. But I have also seen people who blow up their portfolio and end up with nothing. It makes me wonder about the distribution of gains/losses by during this bull run. </p>\n\n<p>Do you have any advice for me? How do you deal with the FOMO?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qqtjy9/seeking_advice_after_fomo_and_straying_from/","title":"Seeking advice after FOMO and straying from boglehead philosophy","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-10T19:01:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-10 19:01","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qqtjy9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qqtjy9/seeking_advice_after_fomo_and_straying_from/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qqtjy9/seeking_advice_after_fomo_and_straying_from/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"plokigg","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/plokigg","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"plokigg","score":16,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qqseif","excerpt":"Given the growing hype surrounding the $65 Billion Rivian IPO\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/rivian-raises-ipo-price-range-and-could-now-be-worth-up-to-65-billion.html]\n[1], I felt this is the perfect time to follow up on my first analysis on…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/","title":"What is the best time to buy an IPO? - I analyzed 1,000+ IPO's over the last two decades!
