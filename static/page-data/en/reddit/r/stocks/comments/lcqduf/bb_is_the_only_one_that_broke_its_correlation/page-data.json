So they rode the BB/AMC/NOK/GME wave, and then pulled out leaving retail as the bag holders.</p>\n\n<p>But unlike AMC, NOK and GME, BB finally broke out of the correlation, and traded upward today. Which is a good sign and maybe due to the common sentiment that it&#39;s very undervalued and potentially has a very bright future with the IoT and EV market.</p>\n\n<p>Fidelity Research gives it an average analyst score rating of 8.9/10 (9-10 is in the very bullish range), with the most notable analyst being Zacks Ranking. Seeking Alpha seems to place it at a fair value price of around $15-17. It&#39;s now around $12.
