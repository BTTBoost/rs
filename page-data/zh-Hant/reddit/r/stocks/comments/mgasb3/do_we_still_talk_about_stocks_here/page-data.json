Honestly, the market goes down 0.001 percent and the subs flooded with reassuring posts to stop some guy who&#39;s lost 10 cent from selling at a loss.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s embarrassing. We are supposed to be a sub that talks about stocks. Why can&#39;t we just sticky a post that states that stocks go down as well as up and that a red day doesn&#39;t mean anything and be done with it?\nHalf the subs in this post aren&#39;t even about a stock anymore. Between that and the constant pump and dumps from WSBs we aren&#39;t a fraction of the sub we was before covid.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone else feel this way? Or do you enjoy the daily reassurance posts for when a stock you own goes down one percent after going up 200 percent this year?</p>\n\n<p>Worst part is that the posts reassuring people are always based of nothing from bag holders from pump and dump posts. BB is up an obscene amount. No it&#39;s not going back up to 25 dollars anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p>Pump and dumps have left us with tons of bag holders and now they all constantly make posts to help themselves and others hold the bags based on zero evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Can&#39;t wait for all the triggered BB holders but it&#39;s just an example of a Wsb pump and dumped that&#39;s screwed half the sub over that now gets a daily cry post</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mgasb3/do_we_still_talk_about_stocks_here/","title":"Do we still talk about stocks here?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-30T10:30:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-30 10:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"edcf7e94-544d-5e2b-9b8e-4ba44b70bc66","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mgasb3/do_we_still_talk_about_stocks_here/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mgasb3/do_we_still_talk_about_stocks_here/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"markhalliday8","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/markhalliday8","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"markhalliday8","score":160,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我们还在这里谈股票吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我不相信这个子变得这么软。老实说，市场下跌\n0.001%，子上涌现了很多让人放心的帖子，阻止某个人的\n亏本卖出，损失了1毛钱。\n\n这是很尴尬的。我们应该是一个谈论股票的子。怎么会呢？\n我们就不能贴个帖子... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們還在這裏談股票嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我不相信這個子變得這麼軟。老實說，市場下跌\n0.001%，子上湧現了很多讓人放心的帖子，阻止某個人的\n虧本賣出，損失了1毛錢。\n\n這是很尷尬的。我們應該是一個談論股票的子。怎麼會呢？\n我們就不能貼個帖子... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b9e3de0d-ea48-5ac8-8f2b-d11e3461b92d","excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/bsszab850zp61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba55d9db2b33a9f30163afa70f670c4867c4a48d\n\nSo if you were trading late Friday as I was, you noticed the crazy EOD upward\naction in the SPY AND RKT (pictured above)\n\nWe found out over the weekend that a major HF blew up on…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfq2se/rkt_hedge_fund_archegoes_had_40b_short_exposure/","title":"RKT 🚀🚀🚀, Hedge Fund ARCHEGOES had 40B short exposure and the price action looks like RKT was in his short book and is being covered now!!!! 🚀🚀🚀 + MOAR","date":"March 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"RKT 🚀🚀🚀，对冲基金ARCHEGOES有40B的空头风险，价格走势看起来RKT在他的空头书中，现在被覆盖!!!!。🚀🚀🚀+ MOAR","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/bsszab850zp61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba55d9db2b33a9f30163afa70f670c4867c4a48d\n\n所以，如果你和我一样在周五晚些时候交易，你就会注意到疯狂的EOD上行\n在SPY和RKT（上图）的行动。\n\n我们发现在周末，一个主要的高频炸毁了... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"RKT 🚀🚀🚀，對沖基金ARCHEGOES有40B的空頭風險，價格走勢看起來RKT在他的空頭書中，現在被覆蓋!!!!。🚀🚀🚀+ MOAR","the_new_excerpt":"https://preview.redd.it/bsszab850zp61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba55d9db2b33a9f30163afa70f670c4867c4a48d\n\n所以，如果你和我一樣在週五晚些時候交易，你就會注意到瘋狂的EOD上行\n在SPY和RKT（上圖）的行動。\n\n我們發現在週末，一個主要的高頻炸燬了... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-d67d7dc9-8b80-550a-9988-d69008fd8a9d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mg7fx5/we_still_holding/","title":"We still holding 🤲🏾💎🚀🌕","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 30, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我们仍然持有🤲🏾💎🚀🌕。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們仍然持有🤲🏾💎🚀🌕。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-edcf7e94-544d-5e2b-9b8e-4ba44b70bc66","previousId":"RedditPost-b9e3de0d-ea48-5ac8-8f2b-d11e3461b92d","nextId":"RedditPost-d67d7dc9-8b80-550a-9988-d69008fd8a9d","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mgasb3/do_we_still_talk_about_stocks_here/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
