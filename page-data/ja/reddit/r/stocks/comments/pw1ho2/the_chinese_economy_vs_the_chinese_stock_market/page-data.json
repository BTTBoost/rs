We certainly all have the feeling that rapid growth = higher stock returns.  So, lets put that to the test, shall we?</p>\n\n<p>There is a thing called the MSCI China index which has been around since at least 1992.  It has a wonderful website which I encourage you to visit, go look them up!  According to the website, “The MSCI China Index captures large and mid cap representation across China A shares, H shares, B shares, Red chips, P chips and foreign listings (e.g. ADRs). With 730 constituents, the index covers about 85% of this China equity universe. Currently, the index includes Large Cap A and Mid Cap A shares represented at 20% of their free float adjusted market capitalization.”</p>\n\n<p>So if rapid growth = higher stock returns, what would you guess the annualized return would be on the MSCI China index measured in US dollars since 1992?  Should be way over 10%, right? Maybe 15 or 20?  Well, the website very conveniently tells you what the annualized return is……A whopping 2.2%.   Yep, thats it, just 2.2%!  Compare that to the MSCI Emerging Markets index which over the same time span returned 7.75%.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know how to explain this or why it is, but facts are facts.  While China’s economy has no doubt been a world beater, it’s stock market has been a dud.  Anyone have any ideas why?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pw1ho2/the_chinese_economy_vs_the_chinese_stock_market/","title":"The Chinese Economy Vs.
