I mean, I&#39;m smart right? At least smarter than half of you! Then I read Bogle and all the other data showing its single digit % of investors beat the market long term. To understand this I&#39;ve come to a theory that &quot;The Market&quot; is an optimization, not an average. </p>\n\n<p>The theory: as long as society maintains stability (bigger &quot;if&quot; these days), the economy will grow (for reasons) and thus companies and stocks along with it. There is always churn and noise but over the long term the duds get filtered out and the studs end up making a majority of the market. Even if you&#39;re picking good stocks, so is the broader market. That makes it hard to beat when the market also has your winners every time. It also has mostly winners and very few losers so if you happen to pick one bad stock you can easily get crushed vs the index. The market is continually optimizing so the effort and reward for trying to beat it are not justified. </p>\n\n<p>This concludes my surface level, non-economist, inexperienced justification for why I consolidated everything into SNDL...j/k, it starts with a V. Please destroy my optimization theory so I can learn about a hammer candle.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qumaht/journey_to_cant_beat_the_market_acceptance_final/","title":"Journey to \"cant beat the market\" acceptance - final step","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-15T23:17:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-15 23:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qumaht","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qumaht/journey_to_cant_beat_the_market_acceptance_final/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qumaht/journey_to_cant_beat_the_market_acceptance_final/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"lifejacketpreserver","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lifejacketpreserver","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lifejacketpreserver","score":16,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1460261845818920970","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1460261845818920970","title":"WeWork has had net losses totaling $13.4 billion since the start of 2016.
