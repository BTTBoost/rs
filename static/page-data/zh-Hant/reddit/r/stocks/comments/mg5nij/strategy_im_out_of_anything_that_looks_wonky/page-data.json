Bonds are being sold off like crazy and real yields are negative. </p>\n\n<p>GE?  Out.  Going through a restructuring right now which seems to look promising, but they&#39;re doing wonky things like a reverse stock split that I don&#39;t like.</p>\n\n<p>GME? Out.  Yeah it might go to the moon, and Ryan Cohen might save it, but then again I might also be dead by the time any of that happens. </p>\n\n<p>(I was holding all 4 of these at one point)</p>\n\n<p>Other hypothetical examples:\nARKK? Pass. If I had bought in 12 months ago, great play.   But right now?  It&#39;s not something I&#39;m sure I want to be holding, and definitely don&#39;t want to be buying at this price.  Cathy Wood did great, but her God talk is wonky to me and anyone who was heavy in tech had a great year, not just her.  I don&#39;t know if I trust her abilities going forward. </p>\n\n<p>ARKX? Pass, for same reasons plus I don&#39;t understand why she picked the stocks she did at all.  Wonky.  God talk, etc. </p>\n\n<p>TSLA? Pass.  Way too expensive right now even if future earnings might (keyword <em>might</em>)  justify this P/E ratio. Too volatile, too. </p>\n\n<p>XXII? Pass.  You probably haven&#39;t heard of this one, but someone recommended them to me because they might be the future of smoking with their &quot;zero nicotine cigarettes&quot;.  That&#39;s just wonky, folks, even if there might be a small market for that, ugh, maybe. </p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin?  Out.  Not a real currency and way too volatile and uncertain. </p>\n\n<p>I probably triggered some people. Feel free to explain why I&#39;m wrong about any of these.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, no risk, no reward.  So if you want to put a little bit into Bitcoin or Tesla, by all means.  But my current philosophy is that we can just avoid all the wonkiness and go for the straight forward plays.  You know, the Apples, Microsofts, Costcos, Phillip Morris, etc.  Or hell, go ahead and stick it in VOO. I didn&#39;t, that&#39;s not my style, but it&#39;s a safer play than probably everything I listed at the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m new to this so take what I&#39;m saying with a grain of salt.  But I think I understand why they say that &quot;most people lose money in the stock market&quot;.  It&#39;s because they&#39;re always chasing performance (buying ARKK at ATH) and picking winners based off some vague notion like &quot;Elon Musk and Tesla are the future&quot;.  It&#39;s not smart, and it&#39;s a recipe for disaster. </p>\n\n<p>If you are like Mr. Keith Gill and can truly identify deep value, more power to you.  But you don&#39;t find deep value by buying the same stocks that everyone else is. </p>\n\n<p>TL; DR: the markets are pretty weird and uncertain right now.  So, IMO, why make things any more uncertain or wonky?  Just stick with good businesses that will do well in the sort, mid, and long term.</p>\n\n<p>Or do index funds. I chose individual stocks because with my picks I think I will be safer in the event of a correction.  The market can be kinda wonky sometimes, too.  But that&#39;s just my style based on my current risk tolerance. </p>\n\n<p>So far I am slightly up on the month and on the YTD, with a look for the long-term.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/","title":"Strategy: I'm out of anything that looks wonky right now.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-30T03:45:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-30 03:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"114e599c-d77d-5212-a3f8-f4e664eb569d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"shortyafter","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/shortyafter","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"shortyafter","score":272,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"策略。我现在没有任何看起来不正常的东西。","the_new_excerpt":"BABA? 出。中国的不确定因素太多。\n\nBND？出局。债券被疯狂抛售，实际收益率为负。\n\nGE? 出局。现在正在进行重组，看起来很有希望。\n但他们在做一些不正常的事情 比如说我不喜欢的反向股票拆分\n\nGME? 退出。是的，它...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"策略。我現在沒有任何看起來不正常的東西。","the_new_excerpt":"BABA? 出。中國的不確定因素太多。\n\nBND？出局。債券被瘋狂拋售，實際收益率爲負。\n\nGE? 出局。現在正在進行重組，看起來很有希望。\n但他們在做一些不正常的事情 比如說我不喜歡的反向股票拆分\n\nGME? 退出。是的，它...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8ab1c738-81c0-5cc1-95ca-814c6ed891a2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfzcar/bb_yolo_because_marketwatch_can_kiss_my_gorilla/","title":"$BB YOLO because MarketWatch can kiss my gorilla ass for spreading FUD before earnings","date":"March 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$BB YOLO，因为MarketWatch可以亲吻我的大猩猩的屁股，因为它在财报之前散布FUD。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BB YOLO，因爲MarketWatch可以親吻我的大猩猩的屁股，因爲它在財報之前散佈FUD。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-70178930-978d-560f-8caa-d844e6368c91","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mg69rk/walking_into_rwallstreetbets/","title":"Walking into r/WallStreetBets","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 30, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"走进r/WallStreetBets","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"走進r/WallStreetBets","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-114e599c-d77d-5212-a3f8-f4e664eb569d","previousId":"RedditPost-8ab1c738-81c0-5cc1-95ca-814c6ed891a2","nextId":"RedditPost-70178930-978d-560f-8caa-d844e6368c91","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
