The entire story is just a tip of the ice berg of what is really happening every day behind the curtains all the while 50% of the world is suffering from hunger and war.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion from the paper:\nThe extreme volatility in meme stocks in January 2021 tested the capacity and resiliency of our securities markets in a way that few could have anticipated. At the same time, the trading in meme stocks during this time highlighted an important feature of United States securities markets in the 21st century: broad participation. There are many different types of investors, and they buy and sell stocks for many different reasons. However, when share prices change rapidly and brokerage firms suddenly suspend trading, investors may lose money.\nUnderneath the memes are actual companies, with employees, customers, and plans to invest in the future. Those who bought GameStop became co-owners of a company through a system of mutual trust and participation that sustains our economy. People may disagree about the prospects of GameStop and the other meme stocks, but those disagreements are what should lead to price discovery rather than disruptions. These events present an opportunity to reflect on the market structure and regulatory framework and identify additional areas for potential study and further consideration in the interests of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qawqku/secs_take_on_what_happened_in_january_2021_full/","title":"SEC's take on what happened in January 2021 - full official report","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-18T22:45:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-18 22:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qawqku","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qawqku/secs_take_on_what_happened_in_january_2021_full/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qawqku/secs_take_on_what_happened_in_january_2021_full/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"magadget","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/magadget","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"magadget","score":819,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2021年1月に起きたことについてのSECの見解-公式レポート全文","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf\n\n私は絶対に魅力的だと思います。この物語は、日々起きていることの氷山の一角に過ぎません。\n世界の50％の人々が飢えに苦しんでいる中、カーテンの裏では毎日何が起きているのか。\n世界の50％が飢餓に苦しんでいるというのに...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国证券交易委员会对2021年1月发生的事情的看法--官方报告全文","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf\n\n我觉得这绝对是个好主意。整个故事只是冰山一角\n在50%的世界人口遭受饥饿的同时，每天在幕后真正发生的事情。\n世界上50%的人正在遭受饥饿和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國證券交易委員會對2021年1月發生的事情的看法--官方報告全文","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf\n\n我覺得這絕對是個好主意。整個故事只是冰山一角\n在50%的世界人口遭受飢餓的同時，每天在幕後真正發生的事情。\n世界上50%的人正在遭受飢餓和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qaqrg0","excerpt":"Industrial production fell a sharp 1.3% in September, the Federal Reserve\nreported Monday.
