Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.</p>\n\n<p>But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.</p>\n\n<p>Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m77ggf/morgan_stanley_becomes_the_first_big_us_bank_to/","title":"Morgan Stanley becomes the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-17T19:41:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-17 19:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f3a21d9f-8e55-5536-8b60-f14f380f84ca","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m77ggf/morgan_stanley_becomes_the_first_big_us_bank_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m77ggf/morgan_stanley_becomes_the_first_big_us_bank_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"megacurl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/megacurl","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"megacurl","score":2793,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"摩根士丹利成为第一家为其富裕客户提供比特币基金的美国大银行。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html\n\n摩根士丹利是第一家为其财富管理客户提供服务的美国大银行。\n获得比特币资金，CNBC独家获悉。\n\n该投行是一家巨...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"摩根士丹利成爲第一家爲其富裕客戶提供比特幣基金的美國大銀行。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html\n\n摩根士丹利是第一家爲其財富管理客戶提供服務的美國大銀行。\n獲得比特幣資金，CNBC獨家獲悉。\n\n該投行是一家巨...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ad8405ce-68d0-5e97-a093-392cf5164994","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6snc6/finally_some_recognition_from_cnn_but_notice_no/","title":"Finally some recognition from CNN but notice no figure...","date":"March 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"终于得到了CNN的认可，但注意到没有身影... ...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"終於得到了CNN的認可，但注意到沒有身影... ...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1372258052313862144","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1372258052313862144","title":"The Fed:\n\nhere's the same stuff we've been telling you for months\n\nThe stock market:\n\nI'm going to rally again on these comments just to be safe","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 17, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美联储\n\n这就是我们几个月来一直告诉你的东西\n\n股市。\n\n为了安全起见，我打算再次反弹","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美聯儲\n\n這就是我們幾個月來一直告訴你的東西\n\n股市。\n\n爲了安全起見，我打算再次反彈","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-f3a21d9f-8e55-5536-8b60-f14f380f84ca","previousId":"RedditPost-ad8405ce-68d0-5e97-a093-392cf5164994","nextId":"TweetPost-1372258052313862144","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m77ggf/morgan_stanley_becomes_the_first_big_us_bank_to/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
