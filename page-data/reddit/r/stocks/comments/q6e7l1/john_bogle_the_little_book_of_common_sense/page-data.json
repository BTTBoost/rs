Investor return decrease as motion increases.</li>\n<li>Winning Strategy for investing is to buy a fund that holds all market portfolio and hold it forever</li>\n<li>The index fund eliminates the risks of individual stocks, market sectors, and manager selection. Only stock market risk remains, which is large</li>\n<li>A traditional index fund operates with minimal expenses, no advisory fees, with tiny portfolio turnover, and high tax efficiency.</li>\n<li>Investing in equities long term is a winner&#39;s game</li>\n<li>The returns earned by business are ultimately translated into the stock market</li>\n<li>Investing is a zero-sum game, for every person that beats the market by 1% someone else lost by 1%.</li>\n<li>Mutual fund investors are confident they can easily select the right fund managers. They are WRONG</li>\n<li>When the stock temporarily overperforms or underperforms the business, a limited number of shareholders receive outsized benefits at the expense of those they trade with…. Over time, the aggregate gains made must of necessity match the business gains of the company</li>\n<li>The stock market returns must equal the business returns over a long period. But this goes up and down in cycles. As investors are willing to pay higher or lower P/E.</li>\n<li>Investment yield on stocks (dividends plus dividend earnings growth) tracks with the total market return. About 9.5% for the last 100 years</li>\n<li>Reversions to the mean – Tendency for P/E ratios to return to their long-term norms over time.</li>\n<li>Economics controls the long-term stock market return. Emotions control the short term. Accurately predicting short term emotions is impossible</li>\n<li>Occam&#39;s razor – when there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the most simple</li>\n<li>Solution – buy and hold a diversified, low cost portfolio that tracks the stock market</li>\n<li>Investors as a group must earn precisely the market return, BEFORE THE COSTS OF INVESTING ARE DEDUCTED – when we subtract all the fees, turnover, taxes, commissions, sales loads, advertising, and legal fees – the returns of investors will fall short of the market by precisely those costs. The lower these costs the better</li>\n<li>Before costs, beating the market is a zero-sum game, after costs, it is a loser&#39;s game</li>\n<li>Focus on the lowest cost funds – the more managers take, the less investors make</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t invest in funds based on past performance. Performance comes and goes. But costs go on forever</li>\n<li>Costs\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expense Ratio</li>\n<li>Sales Charge</li>\n<li>Purchase and sale of securities or turnover</li>\n<li>Assume the turnover costs equal 1% the turnover rate. IE - 100% turnover = 1%. 50% turnover = 0.5%</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Low cost funds beat high cost funds</li>\n<li>Most equity fund investors actually get lower returns than the funds they invest in.…. why? Counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection. Most investors put money in as a fund is rising and pull money out as it is falling. Investors chase past performance.</li>\n<li>Actively managed funds are tax inefficient due to turnover</li>\n<li>Fund returns are devastated by costs, adverse fund section, bad timing, taxes and inflation</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t look for the needle, just buy the whole haystack</li>\n<li>355 equity funds from 1970 to 2006 – 80% had gone out of business. Only 2 of the 355 funds had superior performance during this time (beat the index by 2%) 8 funds beat the index by 1%. The odds of you picking one of these funds is extremely low.</li>\n<li>As the active fund does better, it has more inflows of cash which makes it difficult to maintain that advantage.</li>\n<li>Picking a winner based on the past is hazardous duty</li>\n<li>Over the long-term stocks have provided higher returns than bonds, so why own bonds?\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bonds have beat stocks in 42 of the last 112 years</li>\n<li>They reduce volatility in the portfolio</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Investors who seek to increase yields in their bonds by investing in junk bonds should be careful. If you are going to do it make it a very small percent of your portfolio.</li>\n<li>Long term bonds are much more volatile than short term</li>\n<li>Ben Graham – The average manager cannot obtain better results than the S+P 500. Investors should be content with earning the markets return. Only low-cost index investing can guarantee that outcome.</li>\n<li>Asset allocation accounts for 94% of return. 2 factors that determine how you should allocate your portfolio\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to take risk – depends on financial position, liabilities, years. In general, you are able to take more risks the longer time horizon you have</li>\n<li>Willingness to take risk – matter of preference. Some investors can handle the up and downs. If you can&#39;t sleep at night, you have too much risk.</li>\n<li>These two factors determine your risk tolerance</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Rebalance portfolios at most once per year</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Bogleheads Guide to Investing</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Have a 3 month to 1-year emergency fund available. Most people 6 months is good</li>\n<li>How much you save is the primary driver of wealth accumulation</li>\n<li>Buying a new car every few years can decrease your net worth more than anything</li>\n<li>Stock – you are an owner in the business</li>\n<li>Bond – you are a creditor</li>\n<li><p>Make sure you put your least tax efficient funds in a tax-sheltered account and your more efficient funds in a taxable account. Stocks are more tax efficient than bonds.</p></li>\n<li><p>Order from least to most tax efficient</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>High-Yield Bonds – least tax efficient</li>\n<li>International Bonds</li>\n<li>Taxable Domestic Bonds</li>\n<li>TIPS</li>\n<li>REITs</li>\n<li>Balanced Funds</li>\n<li>Active Stock funds</li>\n<li>Stock trading accounts</li>\n<li>Small cap stocks</li>\n<li>Large value stocks</li>\n<li>International Stocks</li>\n<li>Large growth stocks</li>\n<li>Stock index funds</li>\n<li>Tax managed funds</li>\n<li>EE and I bonds</li>\n<li>Money Market funds</li>\n<li>Municipal bonds – most tax efficient</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Don&#39;t try to time the market. You can&#39;t do it. No one knows where it will be next year.</p></li>\n<li><p>A large study was done on financial newsletters, &quot;experts&quot;, and TV shows and it was determined there is no evidence that they can time the market and consistent with mutual fund studies, winners rarely win again and losers often lose again.</p></li>\n<li><p>Picking mutual funds based on Morningstar&#39;s rating system doesn&#39;t work. 5-star portfolios have underperformed the S+P 500</p></li>\n<li><p>Rebalancing works on the theory of RTM (reversion to the mean) so you are essentially selling high and buying low.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can rebalance by selling your winners, putting new money into the underweight funds, or instead of reinvesting dividends, direct them toward the underweight funds. Think about the tax consequences of this if the funds are in a taxable account</p></li>\n<li><p>It is not a good idea to not rebalance and let your winner&#39;s ride. If you had done this in the late 90&#39;s, tech would have been massively overweighed in your portfolio and you would have taken a huge hit. But if you rebalanced, you locked in some of those gains.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tune out the &quot;noise&quot;</p></li>\n<li><p>No one knows what the market will do short term</p></li>\n<li><p>Mutual fund reporters lead a secret life. By day they write &quot;Six funds to buy NOW!!!!.... By night, they invest in index funds</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q6e7l1/john_bogle_the_little_book_of_common_sense/","title":"John Bogle The Little Book of Common Sense Investing and The Bogleheads Guide to Investing Book Summary","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-12T13:29:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-12 13:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q6e7l1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q6e7l1/john_bogle_the_little_book_of_common_sense/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q6e7l1/john_bogle_the_little_book_of_common_sense/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"captmorgan50","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"captmorgan50","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ジョン・ボーグル The Little Book of Common Sense Investing and The Bogleheads Guide to Investing 書籍概要","the_new_excerpt":"ジョン・ボーグル\n\n常識的な投資のための小さな本\n\n * バフェット - ニュートンズの第4運動法則 運動が大きくなると投資家のリターンは減少する\n   増加する。\n * 投資の必勝法は、すべての市場ポートフォリオを保有するファンドを購入し、それを永遠に保有すること。\n   ポートフォリオを購入し、それを永遠に保有すること\n * インデックスファンドはリスクを排除します。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"约翰-博格《投资常识小书》和《博格尔赫德投资指南》书摘","the_new_excerpt":"约翰-博格\n\n常识性投资小书》（The Little Book of Common-Sense Investing\n\n * 巴菲特 - 纽顿第四运动定律。投资者的回报随着运动的增加而减少。\n   增加。\n * 投资的制胜策略是购买一个持有所有市场投资组合的基金，并永远持有。\n   投资的成功策略是购买一个持有所有市场投资组合的基金，并永远持有它\n * 指数基金消除了风险...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"約翰-博格《投資常識小書》和《博格爾赫德投資指南》書摘","the_new_excerpt":"約翰-博格\n\n常識性投資小書》（The Little Book of Common-Sense Investing\n\n * 巴菲特 - 紐頓第四運動定律。投資者的回報隨着運動的增加而減少。\n   增加。\n * 投資的制勝策略是購買一個持有所有市場投資組合的基金，並永遠持有。\n   投資的成功策略是購買一個持有所有市場投資組合的基金，並永遠持有它\n * 指數基金消除了風險...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1447764175489540096","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1447764175489540096","title":"Re: Gruden emails\n\nIs it now commonplace to presume any private email sent can and will be leaked for purposes of cancellation?
