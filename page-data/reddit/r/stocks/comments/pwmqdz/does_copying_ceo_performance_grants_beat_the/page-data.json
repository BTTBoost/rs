The initial results are very promising (12-25% ɑlpha on average depending on the timeframe), but more research needs to be done!</p>\n\n<h1>How it works:</h1>\n\n<p>I wrote a python script that scraped every single Form 4 filed in 2017. It was only looking for filings that matched the below criteria:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The grant was a Performance Grant. Performance Grants are used to reward executives with stock only if they reach certain performance targets</li>\n<li>The Performance Grant targets were for the stock to reach specified price targets. This means that the executive would receive stock <strong><em>only</em></strong> if the stock hit certain price targets during the given timeframe</li>\n<li>The executive receiving the grant was a CEO or President.</li>\n<li>The grant was not regularly scheduled (i.e. it wasn’t a grant they would receive every year). FIltering these out makes it more likely that the grant was given because the CEO and Board of Directors have confidence that the stock can reach the price targets.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Overall Results</h1>\n\n<p>These kinds of grants don’t happen very often, there were only 9 of them in 2017, but they did indeed beat the market.</p>\n\n<p>Of the 9 stocks that were found, all of them peaked at a price more than 35% above the performance grant and 6 of them peaked up more than 100% in the 3 years following the grant.</p>\n\n<p>The below table is the average returns by months since the performance grant for the SPY and the stocks I found.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Num months =&gt;</th>\n<th align=\"left\">1</th>\n<th align=\"left\">3</th>\n<th align=\"left\">6</th>\n<th align=\"left\">12</th>\n<th align=\"left\">18</th>\n<th align=\"left\">24</th>\n<th align=\"left\">30</th>\n<th align=\"left\">36</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>SPY Returns</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">1.83%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">4.62%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">7.41%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">13.50%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14.40%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">17.80%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">22.87%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">30.50%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Our Returns</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">7.35%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">20.24%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">37.45%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">46.55%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">29.10%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">31.61%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">46.38%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">60.13%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Alpha</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">5.52%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">15.62%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">30.04%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">33.05%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14.70%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">13.81%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">23.51%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">29.63%​</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This table is median returns by months since the performance grant.

I felt like these gave a pretty good overview of the short, medium, and long-term returns for each grant.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>9 stocks aren’t very many</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>True. The sample size is very small. I am in the process of doing the analysis for more years to increase this number, but the number will never get very large as these types of grants don&#39;t happen super often.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This isn&#39;t adjusted for risk in any way</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is also true. These stocks vary from small to large market cap and have different levels of volatility which can affect the returns on a risk-adjusted basis. It may be worth diving into risk adjustments at some point, but right now I want to focus on gathering more data and seeing if there are any potentially viable investment strategies around the data.</p>\n\n<h1>Takeaways</h1>\n\n<p>I definitely think this is promising, but the hard part is putting it into action. Obviously, if we could see the future and sell at the max price for all of the stocks, we’d all make millions, but the stocks don’t all just go up and to the right.</p>\n\n<p>Some of them fall before popping, some pop and then fall, some pop then fall then pop even more.</p>\n\n<p>There is potentially a viable strategy involving holding the stocks until they reach some return threshold (maybe like 25%) and then letting it run with a stop-loss, but I think I need more data to build better strategies. I will work on gathering more data.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pwmqdz/does_copying_ceo_performance_grants_beat_the/","title":"Does copying CEO Performance Grants beat the market?
