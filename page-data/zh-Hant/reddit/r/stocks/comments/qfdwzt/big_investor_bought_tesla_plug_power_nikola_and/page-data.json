In the third quarter, DNB Asset Management increased investments in EV giant Tesla (ticker: TSLA), and tripled holdings in Plug Power (PLUG), a maker of fuel cells that run on hydrogen. It also initiated positions in embattled electric and hydrogen trucking firm Nikola (NKLA) and Chinese EV maker XPeng (XPEV). The bets appear to be mostly paying off, as three of the shares are comfortably ahead of the market so far in the fourth quarter. DNB Asset Management, a unit of Norway’s largest financial-services firm DNB, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>\n\n<p>DNB, which manages more than $70 billion in assets, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the transactions. DNB bought 23,403 more Tesla shares to end September with 146,516 shares. Tesla stock managed to gain 9.9% in the first three quarters of 2021, compared with a 14.7% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index. But Tesla shares have surged 17% so far in the fourth quarter, topping the 5.5% rise in the S&amp;P 500. </p>\n\n<p>Tesla’s fiscal third-quarter earnings set a record, and analysts raised price targets. The company has been having an impressive run in China. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently taunted <a href=\"https://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a> (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos over who had a higher net worth. Tesla stock itself set a closing high on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>DNB Asset Management bought 1.2 million more Plug Power shares to end the third quarter with 1.6 million shares. Plug Power stock slipped 25% in the first nine months of 2021, but so far in October, shares have surged 28%. Plug Power’s second-quarter sales beat expectations, and investors looked past its wider-than-expected losses, as the company is focused on growth. We noted earlier this month that Plug Power hasn’t been lacking catalysts. CEO Andy Marsh has talked up the company’s partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>DNB bought 188,606 Nikola shares in the third quarter. It hadn’t owned any at the end of the second. Nikola stock tumbled 30% in the first nine months of the year. In July, Nikola founder and former CEO Trevor Milton was charged by federal prosecutors with making misleading and false statements to the company’s investors. Milton, who resigned from the company in 2020, denied wrongdoing at the time of the charges. The company is trying to distance itself from the charges, noting that the government actions are against Milton individually, and not against Nikola itself. The charges stem from Milton’s alleged actions from November 2019 to September 2020, while he was CEO. Nikola become a publicly traded company by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, a transaction completed in June 2020. This month, however, Nikola stock rose after the company reached a lease agreement for 100 vehicles. Shares have lost half a percentage point so far in October.</p>\n\n<p>The asset manager also initiated a position in XPeng, buying 12,060 American depositary receipts. XPeng ADRs slid 17% in the first nine months of the year, but so far in October it has surged 21%. XPeng, along with other publicly traded Chinese companies, face sregulatory risk at home. Yet China also holds potential, as seen by XPeng’s strong deliveries. Last week, XPeng announced an investment in flying cars.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-stock-plug-nikola-xpeng-51634825437?mod=mw_quote_news\">https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-stock-plug-nikola-xpeng-51634825437?mod=mw_quote_news</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qfdwzt/big_investor_bought_tesla_plug_power_nikola_and/","title":"Big Investor Bought Tesla, Plug Power, Nikola, and XPeng Stock","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-25T20:23:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-25 20:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qfdwzt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qfdwzt/big_investor_bought_tesla_plug_power_nikola_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qfdwzt/big_investor_bought_tesla_plug_power_nikola_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Johnblr","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Johnblr","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Johnblr","score":49,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"大物投資家がテスラ、プラグパワー、ニコラ、XPengの株を購入","the_new_excerpt":"大規模な資産運用会社が、米国の上場株式の投資先を変更し、電気自動車産業への投資を増やしました。\n米国の上場株式の投資先を変更し、電気自動車産業への投資を増やしました。DNBアセットマネジメントは第3四半期に\nDNB Asset Managementは、第3四半期に電気自動車大手のTesla (ticker: TSLA)への投資を増やすとともに\n第3四半期には、電気自動車大手のTesla（ticker: TSLA）への投資を増やし、電気自動車用燃料電池メーカーのPlug Power（PLUG）への投資を3倍に増やしました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"大投资者买入特斯拉、Plug Power、Nikola和XPeng股票","the_new_excerpt":"一家大型资产管理公司最近加大了对电动汽车行业的押注，改变了其在美国交易的股票投资。\n改变了其在美国交易的股票投资。在第三季度，DNB\n资产管理公司增加了对电动汽车巨头特斯拉（股票代码：TSLA）的投资。\n在第三季度，DNB资产管理公司增加了对电动车巨头特斯拉（股票代码：TSLA）的投资，并将对Plug Power（PLUG）的持股增加了两倍，该公司是一家燃料电池制造商。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"大投資者買入特斯拉、Plug Power、Nikola和XPeng股票","the_new_excerpt":"一家大型資產管理公司最近加大了對電動汽車行業的押注，改變了其在美國交易的股票投資。\n改變了其在美國交易的股票投資。在第三季度，DNB\n資產管理公司增加了對電動汽車巨頭特斯拉（股票代碼：TSLA）的投資。\n在第三季度，DNB資產管理公司增加了對電動車巨頭特斯拉（股票代碼：TSLA）的投資，並將對Plug Power（PLUG）的持股增加了兩倍，該公司是一家燃料電池製造商。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qfm5qh","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qfm5qh/leave_the_pontificating_to_rpolitics_were_here/","title":"Leave the pontificating to r/politics.
