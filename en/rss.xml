&lt;p&gt;The stock market traded mixed today, with the both the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) slipping whiled the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed on the day, driven higher by a strong performance in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable Numbers Today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPY: -0.19%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QQQ: +0.56%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DIA: -0.76%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.91%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (AAPL): +1.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox (RBLX): +6.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PayPal (PYPL): -3.44%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucid Motors (LCID): 17.34%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said “Just like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:&lt;/strong&gt; 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing claims, week ended November 5:&lt;/strong&gt; 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FDA approved boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE, BNTX) and Moderna (MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines for all adults in the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple regained the mantle of most valuable company from Microsoft, with the company reaching a fresh all-time high today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a pop in the beginning of November, weed stocks continued their steep declines as nationwide legalization efforts in the US continue to falter. The largest fund tracking the pot industry, ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) tumbled to its lowest price since last year and is down 60% from its high in February.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As talked about yesterday, Apple (AAPL) is reportedly accelerating development on its fully autonomous Apple Car, set to debut in 2025. A Morgan Stanley analyst said the car would double revenues and market value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pentagon announced it has issued formal solicitations to Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Oracle (ORCL) for a multibillion-dollar cloud-computing contract to replace the JEDI procurement, which became mired in litigation between Microsoft and Amazon and objections from Congress.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Elon/Tesla has defied all the odds and Tesla is now the Trillion dollar company, but other EV companies stock has skyroketted to skyhigh valuation in last one year without any or much deliveries like FORD (up 117% ),   Rivian up 60%  last week  with no delivery or may be few to their employees&lt;/p&gt;

Right now I’m investing 300 a month  but that would be cut to around 50-100 a month if we moved out. We would be moving out in February 2022. I’m wondering if I should just keep investing and save as much as I can until I can or just get the apartment, live by ourselves and be free, but have no money to invest for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

But often overlooked is how their Omniverse and AI can help companies build virtual factories and identify optimal paths to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-DaWgg4zF8&quot;&gt;great video&lt;/a&gt; showcasing what they&amp;#39;ve done to help BMW&amp;#39;s factories become 30% more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/nvidia-ceo-says-the-metaverse-could-save-companies-billions.html&quot;&gt;Jensen said&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to simulate &lt;strong&gt;all factories&lt;/strong&gt; in metaverses, in this omniverse. We want to simulate plants in omniverse. We want to simulate the world’s power grids in the omniverse.... By doing that, we could decrease the amount of waste, and that’s the reason why the economics are so good for companies,” he continued. “They’re willing to invest a small amount of money to buy into this artificial intelligence capability but what they save is hopefully hundreds and hundreds and &lt;strong&gt;hundreds of billions of dollars&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this explains why Nvidia&amp;#39;s valuation is skyrocketing. This line of business is not reliant on securing chips. This is a subscription based software model -- and right now no one else is close to doing anything like this except for Nvidia. Their combination of Omniverse + AI seems like an unassailable moat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 ) Was this intentionally done by Ford, They invested $500M in Rivian, then Rivian IPOed, Stock p[rice was pumped up and now Ford exits out, Did they they make billions by investing $500M in Rivian ? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Ford also is now openly entering as official competitor for Rivian. They have already released their F150 Lightning and for sure looks good (at least to me)&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know if this is possible but I just want to know what would happen. Let’s take a company with a very small market cap. $WORX has a market cap of 16M at the moment. Could a retail trader buy out half or even an entire float on a broker like robinhood? I know putting a huge buy order would inflate the price dramatically but let’s say it stays around this range for the next 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the price action stable, I buy 10K-50K shares per order. I do this every few hours. I have about $10M of fake money in my account. I do this in stealth mode for the next 30 days till I own more than 70% of the float. Current free float is over 8M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Would this cause it to skyrocket way before the 30 day mark? 
2) Is this illegal? 
3) Would I have to file 13D or would my broker automatically file it for me and put it under the company’s newsfeed? 
4) Would management find out immediately and can they just dilute me even though I’m technically a majority shareholder?&lt;/p&gt;

Shockingly, I find almost everyone who overweights USA stock will consciously look you in the eyes and say that it is quite obvious that USA stock is less risky, and it is because of that lower risk that USA stock will bring a higher return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often make the mirror claim as well: They point out that investing in Chinese or EM companies is far riskier than investing in the USA, and therefore if you want long term high returns you&amp;#39;d be a fool to overweight China/EM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another related claim: Some say that ESG/clean energy companies are obviously the safe future bet, and at the same time they say that ESG/clean energy companies will obviously outperform the rest of the market going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these cases, -you can only pick one.- Given that in none of these instances is the person claiming to be a subject matter expert who is knowledgeable beyond the total knowledge of the market. They will in all cases give basic, known information such as: &amp;quot;America has long been the center of corporate innovation, and maintains a business friendly environment regardless of political party, whereas China is becoming increasingly controlling of their market.&amp;quot; Or ESG folks will say, &amp;quot;Fossil fuel consumption is down across the board, and solar energy is now cost competitive or cost superior in most areas of the globe.&amp;quot; This is day-one minute-one basic information for any institutional investor or fund manager. Since they all know that the risk of Chinese stock is higher than the risk of American stock, then they will demand a lower price and therefore a higher expected return to take on that risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are tempted to believe USA stock is safer and less risky due to it&amp;#39;s superior environment, or sector positioning, or technological foundation, or whatever, then the next words out of your mouth should be, &amp;quot;and that&amp;#39;s why USA stock is expensive and I expect it to underperform.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Even if you can&amp;#39;t see it, there&amp;#39;s always a house, and the house...we know what the house does, and it ain&amp;#39;t losing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that&amp;#39;s where the market&amp;#39;s at with the big players. Even the most boomer or normie-tier investors have, at the very least, HEARD of these. It&amp;#39;s been made extremely available, too. It&amp;#39;s almost easier to buy it than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s what people are doing. They&amp;#39;re hearing the buzz and forking over the dough. But why? Is it the low price? Is it the success stories? Is it the easy access? Is it the presence in the cultural zeitgeist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably all of these, really. But in all of these things, one critical element is missing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honest, real discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just try to have any real discussion about these types of coins with anyone who holds, or is purported to hold, a big-ass bag. Or a small bag. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start talking about market cap, inflation, burn - honestly, any real concern that any reasonable buyer or holder may have, and watch how far you get. Watch how quickly your reasonable questions or concerns get swallowed up by the fervor of the irritated hivemind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what it feels like to be one of those huge hornets that gets vibrated to death by a bunch of bees? Just do the above. Closest human approximation there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no actual reason for the few of these tokens to have succeeded beyond pure novelty and greed, but that won&amp;#39;t be enough for long. They&amp;#39;re simply vehicles by which the illusion of potential riches are delivered to the hungry, wanting masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly disheartening to see how many people there are who are so eager to march to the beat of any drum, even if that march is gonna take them right off a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent some time lurking many, many crypt-communities. All are largely what I&amp;#39;ve described above: willing masses easily duped into closing their minds and opening their wallets, and their attitude reflects it. There&amp;#39;s no real sense of community or belonging. It&amp;#39;s simply &amp;quot;I put my money here, and now I must defend my money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That shit don&amp;#39;t work. Money&amp;#39;s no sufficient coagulating agent for the commingled blood of men. Pursuit of money and wealth alone are, by nature, selfish and isolating. Any community built around those as a central principle are doomed either to fail honestly or - worse - succeed dishonestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, no one really gives a shit about these tokens. Nobody in those communities, or any others like them, gives a shit about each other on an individual level either. You&amp;#39;re a drone. You&amp;#39;re a Wallet. You&amp;#39;re not Steve or Jane or William or Kate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To them, you&amp;#39;re a Nobody. You&amp;#39;re only as good as your ability to buy or sell, because there is no other element to their culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think they will all always be like this, I think you&amp;#39;ve got the wrong of it. The next generation will be those that have a culture and community in in which the making of money is NOT the central element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s mostly about content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly. If a true community can be created, one where creating content on its behalf is the fun of it, it can be an extremely powerful flywheel. When the basis of the coin is community and fun, a self-reinforcing and bootstrapping process can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money comes because of content, the creativity, and the enjoyment everyone gets from it. This is what attracts and retains new holders. It isn&amp;#39;t the other way around. If participating in the community is a fun thing to do, generating money just happens to be a convenient side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TLRY/&quot;&gt;Tilray &lt;/a&gt;is the number one leading international company in the cannabis game.&lt;br/&gt;
They already have operations in Canada, US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would compare weed today to where tobacco were for 100 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;
Investing in weed right now is a opportunity of a life time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the fact that &lt;strong&gt;ROTTEN CITADEL INC&lt;/strong&gt; just increased their short position in Tilray with +20%. Shoutout to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/UMNMURTY/&quot;&gt;u/UMNMURTY&lt;/a&gt; for finding that out!

&lt;em&gt;Edit: For informational purposes Citadel Inc is actually NET LONG on Tilray. They however massively increased their short position the stock on 18th of November in order to bring the price down, before the German legalisation news hit the market).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this account&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/KatheKnuth/submitted/&quot;&gt;post history&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;#39;ll see a common pattern: a few karma-farming posts from a couple of months ago that invariably come in subreddits like &lt;a href=&quot;/r/aww&quot;&gt;/r/aww&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/nextfuckinglevel&quot;&gt;/r/nextfuckinglevel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/MadeMeSmile&quot;&gt;/r/MadeMeSmile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/funny&quot;&gt;/r/funny&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Then nothing, then a submission to a stock subreddit. Anybody with experience moderating subreddits can pick this out as a bought account immediately. This is an extremely common pattern where people build up some easy karma on a clean account and then sell it for use in various promotional campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the post content and you&amp;#39;ll see a pattern that will repeat: one or two paragraphs of content-free &amp;#39;analysis&amp;#39; about events in whatever mining sector, then a series of &amp;#39;pitch&amp;#39; paragraphs where they link to a random junior miner and include the ticker. Presumably this is an attempt to pump/draw attention to these stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been noticing this happening in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/investing&quot;&gt;/r/investing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/r/stocks&quot;&gt;/r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; over the past few months, here are a few examples that I picked up in just 15 minutes by searching for recent posts about &amp;#39;mining&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;copper&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;gold&amp;#39;, and other such keywords. On each of these posts note the exact same post framework and then click on the username -&amp;gt; &amp;#39;posted&amp;#39; tab to see the exact same type of post history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just quickly scanning over posts in these two subreddits over the past month - it&amp;#39;s been going on longer than that and I&amp;#39;m guessing is probably in other investing-related subreddits as well that I just don&amp;#39;t see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&amp;#39;t have any personal opinion on the stocks or sectors in question, but I do feel it&amp;#39;s good to point this out and to remind everybody that when you&amp;#39;re reading stuff on Reddit you are not necessarily reading agenda-free or good faith discussions, you are being marketed to.

Literally every shared portfolio, due diligence and stock opinion is finshed with the I invest for the long term, so I do not really care about the price fluctuations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the sheer panic and mood changes on stocks are made after every small dip, missed earnings or change in analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, that the value of company and mass concensus here is not made by anything, but simple price change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s stock rose singnificantly in the last year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a complete beast and literally everyone needs it in their portfolio!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They missed earnings by 50 basis points, there is small change in the estimates for next year and the stock had not changed in a 6 months?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately sell the company, because you are lacking after the last year biggest homeruns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why this thing is happening is, because most people do not know or have the slightest idea about how much they value their business! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would have a strong opinion on how much you value your business, you want sell it after you believed that you have paid 50 cents on a dollar for it. Most of you are valueing business on the market price that is quoted last second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that you do not understand the businesses you own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, saying Iunderstand Coca-Cola because i know it sells Coke is not understanding business. How many of you know the balance sheet of KO, how many of you read the 10Q and 10K, do you know that KO’s payout ratio of their dividends is above 80% and often was 100% plus? Do you know the management? Can you give a pricetag on these cash flows, that KO will make? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is talking about KO, which is relatively easy to understand company, that nearly everyone has some experience with. I really do not believe that even 0,1% of people who read palantirs reports, looked at its valuation, and most importantly understand the business of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer honestly to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really know the business you own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly i would want to say a story about mass opinions on companies. Microsoft and Apple were for many years considered mature companies with limited growth. Apple was even considered with negative growth rate. After last three years rally in their prices, the opinion on them changed so much that literally everyone believes that they must have them in their portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you also consider this if the price of the stock did not change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this account&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/KatheKnuth/submitted/&quot;&gt;post history&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;#39;ll see a common pattern: a few karma-farming posts from a couple of months ago that invariably come in subreddits like &lt;a href=&quot;/r/aww&quot;&gt;/r/aww&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/nextfuckinglevel&quot;&gt;/r/nextfuckinglevel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/MadeMeSmile&quot;&gt;/r/MadeMeSmile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/r/funny&quot;&gt;/r/funny&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Then nothing, then a submission to a stock subreddit. Anybody with experience moderating subreddits can pick this out as a bought account immediately. This is an extremely common pattern where people build up some easy karma on a clean account and then sell it for use in various promotional campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the post content and you&amp;#39;ll see a pattern that will repeat: one or two paragraphs of content-free &amp;#39;analysis&amp;#39; about events in whatever mining sector, then a serious of &amp;#39;pitch&amp;#39; paragraphs where they link to a random junior miner and include the ticker. Presumably this is an attempt to pump/draw attention to these stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been noticing this happening in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/investing&quot;&gt;/r/investing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/r/stocks&quot;&gt;/r/stocks&lt;/a&gt; over the past few months, here are a few examples that I picked up in just 15 minutes by searching for recent posts about &amp;#39;mining&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;copper&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;gold&amp;#39;, and other such keywords. On each of these posts note the exact same post framework and then click on the username -&amp;gt; &amp;#39;posted&amp;#39; tab to see the exact same type of post history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a roth IRA with Chase (because that’s where I happened to be when I opened it in my mid 20’s) with $32k in it. The vast majority is invested in SAGPX, entirely because that’s what they decided to do based on my age and tolerance risk at the time. I’m told it’s doing “well” but Bogle makes sense to me and I think things could use alterations. My question is- should I be investing in 70% stocks, or more/less than that? What portfolio/stocks/bonds would more educated people recommend? Is Chase garbage or pretty average? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m risk tolerant and intend to work til 68+. I have a 403B that’s invested via Fidelity in an age based plan. I have two young kids for whom I save in 529’s for school. I don’t know what I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

The situation is still volatile but I am planning to buy copper stocks because of the dip knowing that the demand for copper will just keep on increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already placed some in&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southerncoppercorp.com/&quot;&gt; Southern Copper Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (SCCO) since they are paying a dividend of $2.70 per share. I’m thinking of placing in Fortitude Gold, since they’re also paying a dividend which they just increased recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also into getting some juniors seeing how these companies might have some future once the demand for copper increases even more. I’m thinking of getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://cumtn.com/&quot;&gt;Copper Mountain Mining&lt;/a&gt; (CMMC), since they are already producing approximately 100 million pounds of copper equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threevalleycopper.com/&quot;&gt;Three Valley Copper&lt;/a&gt; (TVC) is also promising especially after their upsize with a recent deal financing up to $16 million. Their second quarter results are also remarkable and they are expected to start annual production by the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copper demand is rising and will probably increase and even double in the next few years so I’m taking my chance on this metal. I didn’t put much anyways since I’m making sure I only invest the money I know I might lose in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

So i came here for more informed opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; Question is do i buy in more while its below 40 or do i hold on what i have and just try to get what i can back and invest my money somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
