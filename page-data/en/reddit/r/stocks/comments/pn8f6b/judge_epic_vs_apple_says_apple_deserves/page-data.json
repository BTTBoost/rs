(As mentioned previously, the ruling is full of dunks on the expert witnesses.) But she says Apple is still entitled to license that intellectual property for a fee of some sort, and requiring developers to use Apple’s payment system “accomplishes this goal in the easiest and most direct manner.”</p>\n\n<p>Epic’s unbundling alternative, meanwhile, would “severely undermine” the system, says the ruling. “Indeed, to the extent Epic Games suggests that Apple receive nothing from in-app purchases made on its platform, such a remedy is inconsistent with prevailing intellectual property law.”</p>\n\n<p>Even if developers could entirely stop using the IAP system, “Apple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission,” Rogers writes. </p>\n\n<p>End of quotes.</p>\n\n<p>The judge clearly states that Apple deserves compensation for hosting an App even if payment is made outside the App store. </p>\n\n<p>Apple can still charge the 30% commission according to the judge even if alternate payment is used. </p>\n\n<p>The App Store clearly states the 30% commission is due regardless if Apples payment system is used or not.
