This has sparked discussions about the Metaverse and its future effect on society, and rightfully so. Although I have seen many posts online and especially on Reddit which don’t quite seem to grasp what the Metaverse is and why it&#39;s the future, please note if you are one of these people don’t worry - it’s complicated for sure! This post will explain simply what the Metaverse is and why you should get on board now. I will do my best to explain but if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments and I will be sure to reply.</p>\n\n<p>The Metaverse put simply is the combination of multiple elements of technology, but put more complexly is where virtual reality, blockchain and web3 meet.</p>\n\n<p>The best way of explaining web3 is to first understand web1 and web2. Web1 is what many may consider the first stage of the internet, if you look at what the first iterations of the internet were, it was just code on a screen. It was complex to use and only really used for sharing scientific work. Web2 is what we now know as the internet. This includes Youtube, Reddit etc. The main downside of web2 is for the longest time other than a domain name you couldn’t own anything online. You could make a video and post it on Youtube, even though you feel you own the video and control it, Youtube at any point can remove the video and even your channel. At any point in time everything online can be controlled by someone else. This is where web3 comes in. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. Web3 may as well be called the decentralised internet. It allows users to freely use the internet run on blockchain, so anyone can participate without having your personal data involved or monetized.</p>\n\n<p>This is a big reason crypto based items such as coins and NFT’s have taken off as they are based on web3 technology. For the first time normal everyday people are able to own their own little part of the internet, and no one, including the government, can tell you what to do. It&#39;s the next step for total freedom online.</p>\n\n<p>The Metaverse isn’t a place, the Metaverse isn’t something you can touch. A big mistake I see is people think that there is going to be some sort of invention or overnight change where suddenly the Metaverse is mainstream and that&#39;s our lives, no. It will be a gradual change which has already started and will continue to the point that our virtual life is worth more to us than our physical lives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is the Metaverse the next big thing?:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think the best place to start on why the Metaverse will be the next big thing will be to look back at previous technology. 99% of human attention used to be on our physical environment. TV’s dropped that to 85%. Computers dropped that to 70%. Phones dropped that to 50%. It&#39;s clear that as technology advances it absorbs more and more of our time and energy. At some point something new will drop that to lower and lower numbers to the point where we are using technology 100% of the time, this may take decades but it&#39;s entirely possible. </p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t have to be something mind-blowing but just imagine some type of augmented reality device which either connects to your brain or you see it through contact lenses, imagine it just helped with basic everyday things like arrows on a road so you don&#39;t have to distract yourself with a GPS, or walking into a McDonalds and being able to see the calories of each food item on the menu. These are just basic examples of what the first iteration of augmented reality can do.</p>\n\n<p>The Metaverse will be the next big thing because <strong>it will be everything.</strong> Anything you could imagine will be in the Metaverse. It can range from anything from gaming to concerts to seeing family members from the other side of the world. There is no beginning, middle and end, it&#39;s just infinite code waiting to be filled.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Real life application and potential benefits:</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the potential benefits I want to start with isn’t about what will be good inside the Metaverse but outside it. A comment I’m seeing a lot online is people saying “I want to work on fixing the real world, not create a fake one”. But I think people are missing the point that this will make the real world better. Imagine the millions of cars we can get off the road and reduce pollution if people no longer had to drive to work and school, and instead would stay at home and work in the Metaverse. Of course this may vary depending on the industry but even if we could get 50% of cars off the road it would be a massive achievement.</p>\n\n<p>As I write this more and more benefits keep popping in my head, I will just briefly write some ideas but it&#39;s really going to be endless. Surgeons can practice their work virtually. Architects can design and walk around buildings before construction. Home buyers can visit a home from their own home. People on lower incomes can travel the world from their living room. Schools can visit any museum. Entrepreneurs and businesses can save money on office space. Lovers of history can travel to any time desired (DINOSAURS!). The list really is endless, so I will stop there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Potential negatives and why it won’t matter:</strong></p>\n\n<p>As with any new technology there are always downsides. When the microwave first came out people were terrified of it, same with TV, radio, social media and now the Metaverse. I will note that is a good thing. As a society we should always look to protect ourselves and do what&#39;s best.</p>\n\n<p>The Metaverse won’t be perfect. Even nowadays cyber bullying is a major issue and it may not be any better in the Metaverse. We will distance ourselves further from the real world. Spending less and less physical time with our friends and family and more virtual time with them. The thing is though, the negatives don’t matter. Whether it&#39;s good or bad technology has always advanced on and those who don’t get on board are left behind. Many said at the birth of the internet that it would be bad but it is undoubtedly the best thing to happen to humanity in the past century, and this will have the same effect. I greatly encourage those to at least have an open mind when it comes to the Metaverse, we are on the dawn of something great and those who capitalise on it will be rewarded.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long until the Metaverse is ready and becomes mainstream?:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think this is a very hard question. Actually, I think this is an impossible question. You could try and rephrase it to ‘How long until the internet is ready and becomes mainstream?’ At no point does anyone announce the internet is ready and at no point is it officially called mainstream. At some point it just became what it is.</p>\n\n<p>The Metaverse creation will be gradual, it will most likely take a decade minimum but my guess is as good as yours. I think the point at which we accept as a society that the Metaverse is ready is when our digital selves are worth more than our physical selves. You even start to see it now. Kids care more about how they look on Fortnite than in real life. Teens care more about how many followers they have on Instagram than in real life. The world has and always will be  changing with technology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What to buy and how to make profit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I could list any number of companies which could make you great gains in the near future, including FB, MSFT, U, RBLX, AMZN, ADSK etc. and I would be completely wrong! </p>\n\n<p>Even though I and many others may know a lot about the Metaverse, the truth is we won’t be able to predict even 1% of what the final product will be. If you asked a million people before the internet what the most popular websites would be you wouldn’t get a single right answer. No one knows so anyone telling you what to buy don’t actually have a clue. Yes you can make money in the short term but that’s it. Remember the dot com bubble? Watch out for a Metaverse bubble.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></p>\n\n<p>My thoughts are to tell people now to worry. This isn’t some doomsday device, it’s better to just see it as an extension of your phone. The truth is we are years off of anything serious and no one is going to be forced to use it. I also don’t see any chance of it being stopped by the government as I see some people online say. Sugar and cigarettes are bad but they are legal too. I would recommend anyone to at least try and allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to one of the bigger stock names linked to the Metaverse.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qvc6fr/the_metaverse_and_why_you_should_pay_attention/","title":"The Metaverse and why you should pay attention - Basic breakdown","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-17T03:32:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-17 03:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qvc6fr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qvc6fr/the_metaverse_and_why_you_should_pay_attention/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qvc6fr/the_metaverse_and_why_you_should_pay_attention/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"RealSquishBoy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RealSquishBoy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"RealSquishBoy","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"メタバースと注目すべき理由 - 基本的な内訳","the_new_excerpt":"はじめに、メタバースとは何か？\n\n皆さんもご存知のように、以前はFacebookとして知られていた人気のソーシャルメディア企業が\nFacebookがMetaに社名変更しました。これは、メタバースとその将来の社会への影響についての議論を引き起こしました。\nこれは、メタバースとその将来の社会への影響についての議論のきっかけとなりました。しかし、私は\n多くの投稿を目にしましたが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Metaverse以及为什么你应该关注 - 基本分类","the_new_excerpt":"介绍和什么是Metaverse？\n\n你们现在可能都知道，流行的社交媒体公司，即以前称为\n脸书已将其名称改为Meta。这引发了关于\n这引发了关于Metaverse及其对社会未来影响的讨论，这也是理所当然的。虽然我已经\n看到许多帖子...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Metaverse以及爲什麼你應該關注 - 基本分類","the_new_excerpt":"介紹和什麼是Metaverse？\n\n你們現在可能都知道，流行的社交媒體公司，即以前稱爲\n臉書已將其名稱改爲Meta。這引發了關於\n這引發了關於Metaverse及其對社會未來影響的討論，這也是理所當然的。雖然我已經\n看到許多帖子...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qvo3kl","excerpt":"Remember your lives 10 years ago?
