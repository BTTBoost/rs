For example she spent over a month researching which car to buy, and caught the car salesmen twice trying to sneak higher prices past her during negotiation. She is the perfect person I would expect to be a boglehead.</p>\n\n<p>She is currently sitting on $60k in cold hard cash, that she has been building up for over 3 years. I knew she must have some but I didn&#39;t know it was this much. I introduced her to the bogleheads philosophy, sent her a link to The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, sent her a link to the bogleheads forum.</p>\n\n<p>That was about 6 months ago. I have tried to engage her since then, but she just does not seem interested in the topic. Which is even more infuriating because that&#39;s exactly the type of person who should be investing in low cost index funds. Someone who literally doesn&#39;t care and will only check it every 5 years or so. She said she is too scared to invest, too risk adverse. I tried to tell her (and her sisters) that in fact the riskier thing by far is to not invest. But I don&#39;t seem to be getting through to them.</p>\n\n<p>She is still kind of young, so I think she thinks she still has time, but my analytical brain is on fire thinking of the compounding interest she is losing out on.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else faced this issue? How do I convince her what she is doing, while it may feel safe, is actually way more dangerous?</p>\n\n<p>edit: I should clarify that I am NOT trying to force Bogleheads philosophy on my sister-in-law. I&#39;m not even really a Boglehead myself, although I do admire and desire to be a Boglehead. I have had maybe 3 conversations with her about investing, each less than 5 minutes long. This post is about my anxiety and concern for my family&#39;s financial health.</p>\n\n<p>My mother became very ill when I was 20 years old, and was forced into early retirement. She didn&#39;t have enough saved up by then to survive on her own. It has been very tough for me to witness, and I think my fears are coming out in anxiety when I see other people I love make decisions that might set them up for a similar fate.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qt5em6/cannot_convince_my_sisterinlaw_to_start_investing/","title":"Cannot convince my sister-in-law to start investing","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-13T20:25:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-13 20:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qt5em6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qt5em6/cannot_convince_my_sisterinlaw_to_start_investing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qt5em6/cannot_convince_my_sisterinlaw_to_start_investing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"rickay64","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rickay64","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rickay64","score":37,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"義理の妹に投資を始めるように説得できない","the_new_excerpt":"私の義理の姉は27歳の特別教育の教師です。彼女は、私が知っている中では\n私が知っている中で最も優れたマネーマネージャーの一人です。例えば、彼女はどの車を買うか1ヶ月以上かけて調べ、車のセールスマンが\n例えば、彼女は1ヶ月以上かけてどの車を買うか調べ、車のセールスマンが交渉中に高額をごまかそうとするのを2度も捕らえました。\nしようとしているのを2回もキャッチしました。彼女は、私にとって完璧な人物です...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"无法说服我的嫂子开始投资","the_new_excerpt":"我的嫂子是一名27岁的特殊教育教师。她是我认识的\n我认识的最好的理财者之一。例如，她花了一个多月的时间来研究要买哪辆车。\n她花了一个多月的时间研究买哪辆车，并在谈判中两次抓住汽车销售员试图偷偷提高价格的行为。\n她在谈判过程中被抓住。她是我心目中的完美人选。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"無法說服我的嫂子開始投資","the_new_excerpt":"我的嫂子是一名27歲的特殊教育教師。她是我認識的\n我認識的最好的理財者之一。例如，她花了一個多月的時間來研究要買哪輛車。\n她花了一個多月的時間研究買哪輛車，並在談判中兩次抓住汽車銷售員試圖偷偷提高價格的行爲。\n她在談判過程中被抓住。她是我心目中的完美人選。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qt5xkg","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qt5xkg/vanguards_new_app_flops_with_investors/","title":"Vanguard’s new app flops with investors complaining of user-experience glitches.
