Recent events suggest their suspicion that the decks are stacked against them is justified – which is a terrible look for capitalism.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School, has amassed evidence of widespread insider trading by company executives, Bloomberg Businessweek reported this week. An investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that more than 130 U.S. federal judges failed to recuse themselves from 685 court cases involving companies in which they or their families had investments. And at the Federal Reserve, two policymakers have resigned amid a probe into their personal trading activity.  </p>\n\n<p>Wharton professor Taylor’s research has shown that corporate insiders consistently dumped holdings before official legal probes hurt their company’s shares, Businessweek reported. They also increased their buying and selling in the gaps between audit reports being produced for company boards and being made publicly available, and exploited rules governing scheduled trading schedules for profit.</p>\n\n<p>His analysis suggests the existing regulations governing insider trading are inadequate. It also implies that the Securities and Exchange Commission is asleep at the wheel: The watchdog instigated only 33 insider trading cases last year and just 32 in 2019, the fewest in more than two decades, according to Businessweek.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1974, federal law has explicitly prohibited U.S. judges from overseeing cases in which they or their immediate family have a “legal or equitable interest, however small,” the Journal reported earlier this week. But the newspaper found that in two-thirds of the cases in which judiciary members had a stake, the rulings would have benefited their finances.  </p>\n\n<p>At the U.S. central bank, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan both resigned within hours of each other on Monday. Both had revealed questionable investing activity in their annual financial disclosures. And while they said the trades were within the central bank’s rules, both are being scrutinized further. “We’re looking carefully at the trading that was done to make sure that it’s in compliance with our rules and with the law,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee.</p>\n\n<p>In light of those embarrassing events in the U.S., you’d hope that every central bank in the world is currently getting busy reviewing the protocols governing what policy makers are allowed to do with their personal portfolios while in office. You’d also hope that every central banker in the world is examining their investment activities and tappity-tapping a resignation letter if their pursuit of personal profit is at odds with the probity of their position.</p>\n\n<p>Capitalism is still tarnished by the aftershocks of the global financial crisis, when the risks taken by private capital had to be bailed out by public funds. And the growing prevalence of the fastest-growing companies staying off public markets and funding their expansion instead with private capital keeps them out of the portfolios of retail buyers, further stoking suspicion that the covenant between capitalism and society is asymmetrical and biased against individual investors.</p>\n\n<p>When corporate executives, judges and policy makers line their own pockets by either bending or breaking rules designed to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, they do a disservice to society as a whole. “Most Americans today believe the stock market is rigged, and they’re right,” Wharton’s Taylor told Businessweek.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, public officials have the same right to set aside income for their retirement or to pay school fees or even to buy sport cars or boats. But they can achieve those goals by putting their money into blind trusts or index funds or other financial products that don’t involve them selecting specific individual stocks of companies. Leave day trading to the day traders.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pz8tjh/redditors_are_right_about_the_unfairness_of_the/","title":"Redditors Are Right About the Unfairness of the Market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-01T15:24:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-01 15:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pz8tjh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pz8tjh/redditors_are_right_about_the_unfairness_of_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pz8tjh/redditors_are_right_about_the_unfairness_of_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"_hiddenscout","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_hiddenscout","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_hiddenscout","score":5080,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Redditors are right about the Unfairness of the market","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-01/ordinary-investors-don-t-get-a-fair-shot-when-the-powerful-flout-the-rules\n\nReddit Inc.の株式市場フォーラムに集うデイトレーダーたちの叫び。\nの株式市場フォーラムに集うデイトレーダーたちの叫びは、力を合わせてこそ、本来敵対的な環境の中で繁栄することができるというものです。\n団結してこそ、本質的に敵対的な環境で繁栄することができるのです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Redditors对市场的不公平性是正确的","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-01/ordinary-investors-don-t-get-a-fair-shot-when-the-powerful-flout-the-rules\n\n流连于Reddit Inc.股市论坛的日间交易员们的一个口号是，只有联合起来才能使他们繁荣起来。\n论坛的日间交易员的口号是，只有通过联合起来，他们才能在这个环境中繁荣发展。\n本身就充满敌意...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Redditors對市場的不公平性是正確的","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-01/ordinary-investors-don-t-get-a-fair-shot-when-the-powerful-flout-the-rules\n\n流連於Reddit Inc.股市論壇的日間交易員們的一個口號是，只有聯合起來才能使他們繁榮起來。\n論壇的日間交易員的口號是，只有通過聯合起來，他們才能在這個環境中繁榮發展。\n本身就充滿敵意...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pz6sps","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pz6sps/analysts_explaining_the_current_state_of_the/","title":"Analysts explaining the current state of the stock market","date":"October 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アナリストが語る株式市場の現状","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"分析师解释股票市场的现状","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"分析師解釋股票市場的現狀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pz8v7p","excerpt":"I swear I don’t need sex anymore I have been getting screwed daily by the stock\nmarket.
