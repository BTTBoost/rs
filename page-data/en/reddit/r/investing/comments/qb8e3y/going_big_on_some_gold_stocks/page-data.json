The latter was recently among stocks that can possibly beat inflation.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I’m looking into going for some <a href=\"https://www.firstmajestic.com/\">First Majestic</a> not just for the gold but also since they have the most expensive silver stock out there. Another one would be Equinox Gold since they are showing a lot of potential too. Their operations are not deterred by the pandemic, so they are constantly producing and is possibly headed for a breakout.</p>\n\n<p>For explorations, I think <a href=\"https://collectivemining.com/\">Collective Mining</a> has a lot of room to grow. They already started drilling and have released good results in the recent months. The cash burn is so low and the company is set up for a long timeline. So far that’s the only one I’m going to look into since they’re already showing promise in their drilling results. I also want to be safe so I’m more focused on the bigger ones since they’re more certain and I don’t think I’d lose that much on them.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I have only invested on the bigger producers and is still looking into the others that i have mentioned. I need your thoughts. Is it smart to invest on gold right now since there’s a lot going on with the prices?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qb8e3y/going_big_on_some_gold_stocks/","title":"Going big on some gold stocks","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-19T12:37:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-19 12:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qb8e3y","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qb8e3y/going_big_on_some_gold_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qb8e3y/going_big_on_some_gold_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"DecentSounds","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DecentSounds","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DecentSounds","score":325,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"いくつかの金の銘柄を大きく狙う","the_new_excerpt":"金は再び1750ドルに近づいていますが、最近金が下落したので、私はいくつかの金の銘柄に投資しています。\n最近、金が暴落したので、金の銘柄に投資してみようと思っているんだ。\nというのも、現在の高インフレの環境下では、金の銘柄はうまくいくと思うからです。\n\n私が現在保有しているバリックゴールドは、金の生産量（速報値）が1.09......\n1.09...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"大举买入一些黄金股","the_new_excerpt":"因此，黄金再次接近1750美元，而且由于黄金最近经历了一次下跌，我想投资一些黄金股票，因为我觉得它们会做得更好。\n我想投资一些黄金股票，因为我觉得它们会做得更好。\n在当前的高通胀环境中表现良好。\n\n我目前持有巴里克黄金公司，其初步黄金总产量上升至\n至1.09%。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"大舉買入一些黃金股","the_new_excerpt":"因此，黃金再次接近1750美元，而且由於黃金最近經歷了一次下跌，我想投資一些黃金股票，因爲我覺得它們會做得更好。\n我想投資一些黃金股票，因爲我覺得它們會做得更好。\n在當前的高通脹環境中表現良好。\n\n我目前持有巴里克黃金公司，其初步黃金總產量上升至\n至1.09%。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qavo9k","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 18, 2021\n\nThe market carried on its incredible momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) bouncing\nfor the fourth straight day to add to gains after experiencing the first -5%\ndecline all year.
