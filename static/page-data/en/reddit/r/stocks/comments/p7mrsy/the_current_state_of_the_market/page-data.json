The market these days doesn&#39;t give a f*** about fundamentals. It&#39;s mostly driven by events and the technicals. Companies beat earnings and drop by 10%. Companies miss earnings and go up by 5%. It&#39;s a mess.</p>\n\n<p>The only stable companies are the likes of $FB $GOOG $MSFT etc. Small and mid-caps are being stomped. A conspiracy theory floating on the web: hedge funds are trying to show the retail investors &quot;who&#39;s the boss&quot;. Therefore, retail favourite stocks like $CRSR $TTCF and others are being thrashed. Particularly outside of regular trading hours.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the market is extremely volatile right now and we can see that by getting mini crashes and selloffs whenever J Powell is scheduled to speak. Just gotta stay strong, keep some extra cash on hand to buy any good dips and manage expectations. We can probs expect the same conditions (or worse) for at least 6 months IMO (due to taper, interest rate talks, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts? I really want to hear other opinions. Are you guys bullish / bearish? What are some ways that you cope with the current market (if you&#39;ve changed your strategy at all)?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. This is an amazing learning experience IMO although it&#39;s likely to cost me (us) a decent chunk of cash. That&#39;s the way I&#39;m looking at it :D it&#39;ll just make my investing better in the long-term.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p7mrsy/the_current_state_of_the_market/","title":"The Current State of The Market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-20T16:30:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-20 16:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6a600efe-387f-5efc-b4b6-77e8b7470e67","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p7mrsy/the_current_state_of_the_market/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p7mrsy/the_current_state_of_the_market/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"y_angelov","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/y_angelov","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"y_angelov","score":37,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"市場の現状","the_new_excerpt":"トレーダーの友人と話をしていると 最近の市場はファンダメンタルズを気にしない。\n最近の市場はファンダメンタルズを気にしない。ほとんどがイベントとテクニカルに振り回されている。\n企業は収益を上げても10％下落する。業績が悪くても5％上昇する。\n5%. 混乱しています。\n\n安定しているのは、$FBのような企業だけです...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"市场的现状","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在和我的一个交易员朋友聊天。这些天的市场并不关心\n基本面的问题。它主要由事件和技术驱动。\n公司盈利好，就下跌10%。公司盈利不佳，却上涨了\n5%. 这是一个混乱。\n\n唯一稳定的公司是像FB这样的公司......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場的現狀","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在和我的一個交易員朋友聊天。這些天的市場並不關心\n基本面的問題。它主要由事件和技術驅動。\n公司盈利好，就下跌10%。公司盈利不佳，卻上漲了\n5%. 這是一個混亂。\n\n唯一穩定的公司是像FB這樣的公司......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1428549825700696069","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1428549825700696069","title":"HINT: it’s not the masks https://t.co/T95HOsIA2y","date":"August 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ヒント：マスクではありません https://t.co/T95HOsIA2y","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"提示：这不是面具https://t.co/T95HOsIA2y。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"提示：這不是面具https://t.co/T95HOsIA2y。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1428757008816254980","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1428757008816254980","title":"TALIBAN HAS INHERITED $80B WORTH OF US MILITARY EQUIPMENT OR ~10% OF AMERICA'S ANNUAL DEFENSE BUDGET VALUE *","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 20, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"タリバンは800億ドル相当の米国の軍備を継承しており、これは米国の年間防衛予算額の10％に相当します。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"塔利班继承了价值800亿美元的美国军事装备，占美国年度国防预算价值的10%。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"塔利班繼承了價值800億美元的美國軍事裝備，佔美國年度國防預算價值的10%。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-6a600efe-387f-5efc-b4b6-77e8b7470e67","previousId":"TweetPost-1428549825700696069","nextId":"TweetPost-1428757008816254980","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p7mrsy/the_current_state_of_the_market/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
