I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.</li>\n<li>Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it&#39;s discord community), <em>but it&#39;s vital for the final decision to be yours</em>.</li>\n<li>Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn&#39;t resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead</li>\n<li>Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.</li>\n<li>Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.</p>\n\n<p>Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlvay0/after_3_years_of_learning_investment_my_5_tips/","title":"After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"May 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-27T05:19:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-27 05:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"10c472be-443a-51f5-a9e9-9ce3eb9d1ab1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlvay0/after_3_years_of_learning_investment_my_5_tips/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlvay0/after_3_years_of_learning_investment_my_5_tips/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"msdivinity3d","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/msdivinity3d","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"msdivinity3d","score":3580,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投資を学び始めて3年目の私が、始めたばかりの人に伝えたい5つのこと","the_new_excerpt":"私は、お金を失ったり、取引資金が減少したり、自分の取引資金が破綻したりすることを何度も経験しました。\n過去の失敗から学び、より良いトレーダーになり、カジノのようなことはしないようにしました。\nて、より良いトレーダーになり、カジノのようなことはやめました。\n\n私は、皆さんが何度も耳にしたことを皆さんと共有したくはありません。\nI...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"经过3年的学习投资：我给刚开始的人的5个建议","the_new_excerpt":"我也有过亏损、交易资本缩水的经历，我自己的交易资本也被打碎了很多次。\n在最终从过去的错误中吸取教训，成为一个更好的交易员之前，我曾有过多次亏损、交易资本缩水、击垮自己的交易资本的经历。\n成为一个更好的交易员，不再像在赌场里那样做事情。\n\n我不想与你们分享你们都听过很多次的东西（是的。\nI...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"經過3年的學習投資：我給剛開始的人的5個建議","the_new_excerpt":"我也有過虧損、交易資本縮水的經歷，我自己的交易資本也被打碎了很多次。\n在最終從過去的錯誤中吸取教訓，成爲一個更好的交易員之前，我曾有過多次虧損、交易資本縮水、擊垮自己的交易資本的經歷。\n成爲一個更好的交易員，不再像在賭場裏那樣做事情。\n\n我不想與你們分享你們都聽過很多次的東西（是的。\nI...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-49eedddd-c57a-55b4-9eee-e81223a01973","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021\n\nStocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain\nin the Nasdaq (QQQ).
