AT-301 was considered safe and well tolerated in healthy male and female participants in this study at two different dose levels over 14 days. AT-301 is being developed for at home use for patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19.</li>\n<li>&quot;The intended mechanism of action of AT-301 is to prevent virus entry into human cells by inhibiting the obligatory Spike Protein activation. The activation is performed by three human cell surface enzymes, ACE2, furin, and TMPRSS2, and is therefore unaffected by mutations and variants in SARS-CoV-2.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/02/25/2182576/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Final-Results-from-Phase-1-Clinical-Study-Showing-Safety-and-Tolerability-of-AT-301-Nasal-Spray-Being-Developed-for-COVID-19.html\">Source</a></li>\n<li>“We continue to experience encouraging progress in our MBD and COVID-19 programs, with new regulatory approvals being granted in Sweden for a Phase 2 trial in MBD and authorization in Australia to commence a Phase 2 study of AT-H201 for respiratory illness associated with COVID-19,” said Dr. Steven Quay, Atossa’s President and Chief Executive Officer.</li>\n<li>&quot; Scheduled a special stockholder meeting for September 7, 2021 for the purpose of approving an increase in authorized shares of common stock. If the proposal is approved by the stockholders, Atossa does not intend to issue any of the newly authorized shares of common stock for the purpose of raising capital in the nine months following approval of the proposal at a price less than $10 per share. The newly authorized shares of common stock are intended to be used at any time to complete and/or support acquisitions, collaborations, partnerships and licensing transactions.”</li>\n<li>The fact they’re requesting authorization of common stock like this means there’s obviously something big happening in the backend.</li>\n<li>&quot;Through the completion of capital raising transactions and the exercise of warrants, Atossa has grown its cash balances quarter over quarter for the past three quarters, ending the second quarter 2021 with $142.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.&quot;</li>\n<li>The latest corporate presentation PDF <a href=\"https://atossatherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Final-ATOS-Investor-Presentation-August-9-2021_HF-2.pdf\">https://atossatherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Final-ATOS-Investor-Presentation-August-9-2021_HF-2.pdf</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Expenses</strong></p>\n\n<p>Total operating expenses were approximately $10,534,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021</p>\n\n<p>R&amp;D expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2021, were approximately $5,177,000G&amp;A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2021, were approximately $5,357,000Cash burn rate is at $21,068,000 every 6 months.</p>\n\n<p>So they have enough cash on hand for a minimum of <strong>3 years</strong> without any dilution or funding.</p>\n\n<p>Look at all the institutions that opened up or added to their positions.

They have been buying Atossa before the Russell inclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s talk about the timeline on Phase 3 for Endoxifen. FDA 505(b)(2) may bring Endoxifen to market without the need of Phase 3.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t post. The video because it&#39;s on YouTube. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Interviewer]can you shed some colour on what maybe a phase 3 study may look like … since the FDA is already familiar with Tamoxifen and it’s outcomes…?  </p>\n\n<p>[Dr Quay] .. first of all it’s very hard to answer that, but I think one of the things we have talked about in the past is that there’s a pathway called 505(b)(2) which allows you to submit applications for metabolites of drugs that are already approved. There are some special aspects of that package … you’re allowed to reference the data with the primary drug, you’re typically allowed to do one instead of two controlled clinical trials, and you typically get 7 years of market exclusivity independent of your patent situation. So it’s a nice model and we’ve publicly said that this is our target. We’ve obviously not had conversations with the FDA about all of the aspects of our programs qualifying for 505(b)(2), but I mean I think that’s how I would answer that question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>What is 505(b)(2) ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) is a streamlined NDA process in which the applicant relies upon one or more investigations conducted by someone other than the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained right of reference. In other words, the 505(b)(2) pathway enables investigators and/or manufacturers to apply for approval without having to repeat all the drug development work done for an innovator drug.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/atos%5D(https://fintel.io/so/us/atos\">https://fintel.io/so/us/atos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/atos/blackrock%5D(https://fintel.io/so/us/atos/blackrock\">https://fintel.io/so/us/atos/blackrock</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/13/2280555/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Provides-Corporate-Update-and-Information-about-Upcoming-Stockholder-Meeting.html%5D(https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/13/2280555/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Provides-Corporate-Update-and-Information-about-Upcoming-Stockholder-Meeting.html\">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/13/2280555/0/en/Atossa-Therapeutics-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-Provides-Corporate-Update-and-Information-about-Upcoming-Stockholder-Meeting.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>If you want to contact the CFO/CEO with any questions they&#39;re pretty good at responding, here are their emails.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kyle Guse CFO <a href=\"mailto:kyle.guse@atossainc.com\">kyle.guse@atossainc.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Steven Quay CEO <a href=\"mailto:steven.quay@atossainc.com\">steven.quay@atossainc.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Scott Gordon Investor relations <a href=\"mailto:scottg@coreir.com\">scottg@coreir.com</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p5vktr/atossa_therapeutics_dd_updates_on_their_at301/","title":"Atossa Therapeutics DD , updates on their AT-301 / AT-H201 COVID and Endoxifen breast cancer treatments.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-17T05:42:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-17 05:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a2a747a0-eb9e-50c8-b924-72ed98a23e9d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p5vktr/atossa_therapeutics_dd_updates_on_their_at301/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p5vktr/atossa_therapeutics_dd_updates_on_their_at301/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Youwishh","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Youwishh","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Youwishh","score":60,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Atossa Therapeutics DD社は、乳がん治療薬であるAT-301 / AT-H201 COVIDおよびEndoxifenに関する最新情報を発表しました。","the_new_excerpt":"そろそろAtossa Therapeuticsについて、あまりネガティブにならずにもう一度議論してみませんか？I\nショートスクイーズやガンマスクイーズというナンセンスな話があったが、これは長期的なホールドだ。\n長期的なホールドです。塵も積もれば山となるで、私はこの銘柄を再検討しています。\n特に今は、様々なバリエーションがあるので、これはコビットプレイになるかもしれません...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Atossa Therapeutics DD ，关于他们的AT-301 / AT-H201 COVID和Endoxifen乳腺癌治疗的最新情况。","the_new_excerpt":"现在是时候再次讨论阿托萨治疗学了，没有那么多的负面情绪。I\n我知道有关于空头挤压/伽马挤压的胡言乱语，但这是一个\n长期持有。现在尘埃落定，我正在重新审视这个游戏。\n特别是现在有了所有的变种，这可能是一种创新的游戏，因为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Atossa Therapeutics DD ，關於他們的AT-301 / AT-H201 COVID和Endoxifen乳腺癌治療的最新情況。","the_new_excerpt":"現在是時候再次討論阿託薩治療學了，沒有那麼多的負面情緒。I\n我知道有關於空頭擠壓/伽馬擠壓的胡言亂語，但這是一個\n長期持有。現在塵埃落定，我正在重新審視這個遊戲。\n特別是現在有了所有的變種，這可能是一種創新的遊戲，因爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1a66d5ac-1fff-549f-8db0-f910ce897804","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5mvqr/bb_stock_remember_bb_stock/","title":"$BB stock -
