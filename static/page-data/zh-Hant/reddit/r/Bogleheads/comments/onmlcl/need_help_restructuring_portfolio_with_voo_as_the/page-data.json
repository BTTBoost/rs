I did buy VOO and have been contributing into it every month but I also got caught up in the meme stocks and chasing the gains. I didn&#39;t do very well with that and the amount of energy I was spending on it was starting to interfere with my life. Then I found this community and started to change my portfolio to a more passive account. I&#39;m 36 and would just like to set and forget until its time to retire all while contributing monthly ~$500 to some ETF&#39;s. After some selling my portfolio consists of :</p>\n\n<p>VOO, MSFT, APPL, QQQ, DIS, V, BAC, SMH, QQQJ, ICLN.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to Keep VOO as my core ETF mainly because I do not want to sell it and pay taxes on it only to invest it again. If I sold the other ones (or kept them and contributed more towards other ETF&#39;s) what would pair the best with VOO since it does not contain any small or mid caps? I&#39;m definitely weighted toward large caps right now and very tech heavy which I do not like and would like to diversify more.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people recommend VTI, VXUS, BND but with VOO as my core I was thinking something like these or am I complicating things again.</p>\n\n<p>VOO, VXF, VXUS</p>\n\n<p>VOO, VO, VB, VXUS</p>\n\n<p>VOO, VXF, VWO, VEA</p>\n\n<p>VOO, VIG, VUG, VXUS</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for any advice</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/onmlcl/need_help_restructuring_portfolio_with_voo_as_the/","title":"Need help restructuring portfolio With VOO as the core","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"July 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-20T01:42:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-20 01:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7c03e075-3fb9-5afb-858c-2284bcd478ea","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/onmlcl/need_help_restructuring_portfolio_with_voo_as_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/onmlcl/need_help_restructuring_portfolio_with_voo_as_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"LiquidOrbStudios","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LiquidOrbStudios","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"LiquidOrbStudios","score":29,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"VOOを核としたポートフォリオの再構築を手伝ってほしい","the_new_excerpt":"私が投資を始めたのはコヴィッドが発生する直前で、言うまでもなく私は何も知らなかった。\n自分が何をしているのかわからなかった。VOOを購入し、毎月出資していました。\nしましたが、ミームストックに夢中になり、利益を追い求めてしまいました。私はあまりうまくいきませんでした。\nそのために費やしていたエネルギーの量は、あまり良いものではありませんでした...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"需要帮助重组以VOO为核心的投资组合","the_new_excerpt":"我在Covid袭击之前就开始投资，不用说我也不知道自己在做什么。\n我在做什么。我确实买了VOO，并且每个月都在向它捐款。\n但我也陷入了纪念性股票和追逐收益的行列。我并没有做\n我没有做得很好，而且我在上面花费了大量的精力......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"需要幫助重組以VOO爲核心的投資組合","the_new_excerpt":"我在Covid襲擊之前就開始投資，不用說我也不知道自己在做什麼。\n我在做什麼。我確實買了VOO，並且每個月都在向它捐款。\n但我也陷入了紀念性股票和追逐收益的行列。我並沒有做\n我沒有做得很好，而且我在上面花費了大量的精力......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-077c8f86-ff62-5f60-9515-8285961481c5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onho2t/beary_happy/","title":"Beary Happy","date":"July 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ベアリーハッピー","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"熊熊的快乐","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"熊熊的快樂","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2d592739-9d04-5c81-9654-c2a1d4b3e362","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/onh4rt/held_mrna_almost_a_full_year_gain_porn_the_old/","title":"Held MRNA almost a full year (gain porn, the old fashion way)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 20, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"MRNAを1年近く開催（昔ながらの方法でAVを獲得","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"持有MRNA近一整年（获得色情，老式的方式）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"持有MRNA近一整年（獲得色情，老式的方式）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-7c03e075-3fb9-5afb-858c-2284bcd478ea","previousId":"RedditPost-077c8f86-ff62-5f60-9515-8285961481c5","nextId":"RedditPost-2d592739-9d04-5c81-9654-c2a1d4b3e362","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/onmlcl/need_help_restructuring_portfolio_with_voo_as_the/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
