As of now, the Fed is pacing its purchases at a clip of about $120 billion per month.</p>\n\n<p>But the Fed said Wednesday it will gradually slow the pace of those purchases by about $15 billion per month, as part of a plan to bring its so-called quantitative easing program to a full stop by the middle of next year. The taper will begin “later this month” and will continue at that $15 billion pace through December, although the FOMC clarified it could change the pace of taper as needed.</p>\n\n<p>The Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook,” the FOMC statement reads.\nThe FOMC still maintained short-term interest rates at near zero. The decision on rates and taper was unanimous.\nThe Fed statement continued to double down on its view that high inflation readings will prove to be “transitory,” noting that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.”\nAnticipation for a Fed taper has ramped up discussion over the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee’s next steps: raising interest rates.\nFed officials have made it clear that the timing of taper has no direct implications for the timing of raising short-term borrowing costs from the current setting of near zero.</p>\n\n<p>But markets appear to be getting ahead of the Fed. As Powell and other Fed officials all but signaled that taper was coming, bets on interest rates reflected expectations for a more hawkish cycle of Fed rate hikes through 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Headed into Wednesday afternoon’s announcement, Fed funds futures contracts priced in a strong chance that the central bank will have hiked rates at least three times by the end of 2022. Those expectations ratcheted up in the four weeks leading up to the Fed’s taper announcement.\nThe central bank’s next policy-setting announcement is scheduled to take place Dec. 14 and 15.\nStill, Fed officials have emphasized the need to close the jobs shortfall of 5 million workers (compared to pre-pandemic levels), policymakers have insisted that near-zero interest rates should still support employment as it tapers.\n“I do think it’s time to taper, and I don’t think it’s time to raise rates,” said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Oct. 22.\nIn his press conference, Powell could field questions about whether or not the Fed&#39;s tapering plans are connected to future interest rate hikes. But Powell will also likely face questions regarding the central bank&#39;s ongoing trading scandal, as well as Powell&#39;s own updates on whether or not he&#39;s in consideration for another term as Fed chairman.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qm2ym7/fed_to_begin_taper_later_this_month/","title":"Fed to begin taper later this month","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-03T23:40:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-03 23:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qm2ym7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qm2ym7/fed_to_begin_taper_later_this_month/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qm2ym7/fed_to_begin_taper_later_this_month/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"putsonbears","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/putsonbears","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"putsonbears","score":199,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FRBは今月末にテーパリングを開始","the_new_excerpt":"ソース\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-chairman-powells-odds-at-confirmation-complicated-by-trading-scandal-180153752.html\n\n米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は20日、資産売却のペースを減速し始めると発表した。\nこれは、COVID時代の金融緩和政策を縮小するための最初のステップである。\"In the\n考慮して...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美联储将在本月晚些时候开始缩表","the_new_excerpt":"资料来源。\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-chairman-powells-odds-at-confirmation-complicated-by-trading-scandal-180153752.html\n\n美联储周三表示，它将开始放缓其资产购买的步伐。\n购买，这是缩减其COVID时代的宽松货币政策的第一步。\"考虑到\n鉴于...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美聯儲將在本月晚些時候開始縮表","the_new_excerpt":"資料來源。\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-chairman-powells-odds-at-confirmation-complicated-by-trading-scandal-180153752.html\n\n美聯儲週三表示，它將開始放緩其資產購買的步伐。\n購買，這是縮減其COVID時代的寬鬆貨幣政策的第一步。\"考慮到\n鑑於...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qm5zad","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qm5zad/leveled_up_in_my_100_vtsax_and_relax_ira_account/","title":"Leveled up in my 100% VTSAX and relax IRA account today","date":"November 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の100％VTSAXとリラックスIRAの口座で今日レベルアップしました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"今天在我的100% VTSAX和放松IRA账户中提高了水平","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天在我的100% VTSAX和放鬆IRA賬戶中提高了水平","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qlyzwq","excerpt":"I’m already invested in an index fund, and I know some people suggest leaving\nabout 5% to mess around, but does it even make sense to “learn” about stock\nmarket strategies if I’m committed to being a Boglehead?
