I&#39;ve made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn&#39;t just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. </p>\n\n<p>Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn&#39;t looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It&#39;s easy to tell yourself you aren&#39;t making such a &quot;rookie&quot; mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can&#39;t afford to lose what you&#39;ve put in which means you&#39;ve put too much in. If you&#39;re losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn&#39;t a day trader than you need to lower your investment.</p></li>\n<li><p>panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you&#39;re putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you&#39;re terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you&#39;ll find you&#39;re able to weather the dips long term</p></li>\n<li><p>thinking about your investment as &quot;money you have&quot; to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it&#39;s OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are some tips I&#39;ve learned along the way that might help some others:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Don&#39;t beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you&#39;re in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you&#39;ll be able to climb back out.</p></li>\n<li><p>DON&#39;T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can&#39;t afford in. </p></li>\n<li><p>If you&#39;ve put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It&#39;s extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you&#39;ve lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Just because you aren&#39;t losing money doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t over-investing. Even if you&#39;re seeing gains but you&#39;re living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren&#39;t a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that&#39;s how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you&#39;ll sleep better st night </p></li>\n<li><p>Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.</p></li>\n<li><p>Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say &quot;assume it&#39;s money down the drain,&quot; but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you&#39;re active in trading, it&#39;s hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you&#39;re planning a vacation and the money you&#39;re putting in is what you&#39;re spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you&#39;re dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don&#39;t ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
