The problem is that fee revenue will slowly decline over time, as more competition comes in that offers less fees steal customers away. A new app called <a href=\"https://strike.me/\">Strike</a> offers Bitcoin trading at 0 fees (technically not 0, but less than a penny per transaction). Coinbase will eventually need to evolve it&#39;s business model to stay competitive with companies like Strike.</li>\n<li><strong>Morally questionable VC investing will lead to regulation</strong>: Coinbase is doing some really slimy things with the tokens they list, and it will ultimately be their downfall. For those who are unaware, Coinbase has a VC arm called <em>Coinbase Ventures</em>. Basically, Coinbase buys up the supply in these early presales of these worthless tokens no one ever heard of, brings these obscure tokens to market by listing them on their exchange, and then dumps these tokens on retail investors at ridiculous valuations. Regulators will see this morally repugnant behavior and crack down on it.</li>\n<li><strong>Most of the tokens on Coinbase will be retrospectively classified as securities</strong>: Gary Gensler has said that &quot;Every ICO is a Security&quot;, which makes the majority of tokens listed on the platform securities, including the second largest coin, Ethereum. Classifying them as securities means that Coinbase must legally delist them and will take away 70% of their revenue.</li>\n<li><strong>Bitcoin ETF will steal the majority of volume away:</strong> Grayscale has announced that they are looking to convert <em>all of</em> their funds into crypto ETFs, not just Bitcoin. Meaning, you will see every altcoin like Solana, Cardano Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc... all have their own ETF. So, at some point, you must ask, what&#39;s the point in using Coinbase if all of the coins are going to have their own ETF tickers?</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q3i6uu/thesis_why_im_long_term_bearish_for_coinbase/","title":"THESIS: Why I'm long term bearish for Coinbase stock under their current business model.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-08T17:28:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-08 17:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q3i6uu","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q3i6uu/thesis_why_im_long_term_bearish_for_coinbase/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q3i6uu/thesis_why_im_long_term_bearish_for_coinbase/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ShotBot","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShotBot","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ShotBot","score":37,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"THESIS：現在のビジネスモデルの下で、私がCoinbase株に長期的に弱気な理由。","the_new_excerpt":" 1. 手数料の底辺競争がコインベースを殺す コインベースの収益のほとんどは\n    収入のほとんどを取引手数料で得ています。問題は、手数料収入が時間の経過とともに徐々に減少することです。\n    問題は、手数料収入が時間とともに徐々に減少していくことです。\n    顧客を奪うことになります。ストライク[https://strike.me/]という新しいアプリ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"论题：为什么在Coinbase目前的商业模式下，我长期看跌其股票。","the_new_excerpt":" 1. 在费用上的竞争将杀死Coinbase。Coinbase的大部分收入\n    收入来自于交易费。问题是，随着时间的推移，手续费收入会慢慢下降\n    随着时间的推移，越来越多的竞争者加入进来，提供更少的费用来抢夺\n    抢走客户。一个名为Strike的新应用程序[https://strike.me/]...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"論題：爲什麼在Coinbase目前的商業模式下，我長期看跌其股票。","the_new_excerpt":" 1. 在費用上的競爭將殺死Coinbase。Coinbase的大部分收入\n    收入來自於交易費。問題是，隨着時間的推移，手續費收入會慢慢下降\n    隨着時間的推移，越來越多的競爭者加入進來，提供更少的費用來搶奪\n    搶走客戶。一個名爲Strike的新應用程序[https://strike.me/]...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1446462287011893251","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1446462287011893251","title":"US Unemployment Rate moves down to 4.8%, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. https://t.co/Y0gzZd5V0D","date":"October 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国の失業率が4.8％に低下、パンデミック開始以来の最低水準に https://t.co/Y0gzZd5V0D","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国失业率降至4.8%，是大流行病开始以来的最低水平。https://t.co/Y0gzZd5V0D","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國失業率降至4.8%，是大流行病開始以來的最低水平。https://t.co/Y0gzZd5V0D","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q3wg4r","excerpt":"Over the last year e.g. used cars, timber, recently gas and uranium have\nexploded in price.
