I am interested in advice/strategies to make the best use of this money for the long run. I plan to invest the vast majority of it into Index funds but am looking for help in regards to which funds and what ratios would fit my specific position. A rough   breakdown of what I&#39;ve been told to expect is below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>~250k in cash. This will come over time in fractions as accounts/assets are liquidated.</li>\n<li>~250k  in the form of two separate Inherited IRAs (one in Vanguard, one in TD  Ameritrade). I do not yet know how these are allocated in regards to  Traditional or Roth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some   background: I am engaged (and have told my fiance about the windfall)   to be married October 2022. We are both 30 and government employees   making ~100k each (with expectation of each of our salaries to increase   to ~125k over the next 10 years). Upon knowledge of the windfall, we   immediately altered our TSP contributions for this year to max out the   $19,500 limit by the end of the year (I did the math to ensure we don&#39;t   miss out on the government match) and intend to max our TSP   contributions going forward. We just purchased a house (~380k left on   mortgage @ 2.75%). Fiance has student loans totaling ~100k, however she   is 6 years into the Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve   done research on Inherited IRAs and understand that I will have 10   years to withdraw this money. I understand that I will want to choose   how much to withdraw per calendar year to avoid bumping ourselves into   another tax bracket. We plan to file separately until her student loans  are forgiven via PSLF. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What   should I do with the new found cash and withdrawals from the Inherited   IRAs? I know enough to say I want to invest it into Vanguard Index  funds  but I am looking for advice into the specifics of this as a  beginner (specific funds, ratios, etc.). Is it wise for us to  split/diversify our windfall  outside of throwing it into Index funds  (open another IRA?, switch our health insurance to utilize an HSA?,  etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I  recognize this  is significant amount of money that could set us up  incredibly well in  the future and I would like to make sure it is  properly managed and  invested. While I recognize we are lucky and will be set up very well,  I&#39;m wondering exactly how well setup we can expect to be (if we chose to  retire early, how early is realistic and what we need to do to get  there?). Any and all additional advice is welcome.  I can add any  clarifying information as needed. Thanks in advance  everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/orfjlt/how_to_best_invest_large_windfall_inheritance/","title":"How to Best Invest Large Windfall Inheritance","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"July 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-25T22:17:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-25 22:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9f105af3-e601-5ded-a474-6bde823d6c9e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/orfjlt/how_to_best_invest_large_windfall_inheritance/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/orfjlt/how_to_best_invest_large_windfall_inheritance/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"windfall_throwaway12","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/windfall_throwaway12","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"windfall_throwaway12","score":28,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"莫大な額の相続財産をいかに有効に活用するか","the_new_excerpt":"最近、近親者が亡くなり、多額の相続財産を残してくれました。\n支出しているところです。この遺産を最大限に活用するためのアドバイスや戦略を知りたいのですが\nこのお金を長期的に有効活用するためのアドバイスや戦略に興味があります。私は、このお金の大部分を\nインデックス・ファンドに投資する予定ですが、そのための助言を求めています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如何以最佳方式投资大笔意外收入的遗产","the_new_excerpt":"一位近亲最近去世了，给我留下了一笔可观的遗产。\n正处于支付过程中。我对建议/策略感兴趣\n以使这笔钱得到最好的长期使用。我计划将其中绝大部分投资于\n我计划将其大部分投资于指数基金，但我想在以下方面寻求帮助。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何以最佳方式投資大筆意外收入的遺產","the_new_excerpt":"一位近親最近去世了，給我留下了一筆可觀的遺產。\n正處於支付過程中。我對建議/策略感興趣\n以使這筆錢得到最好的長期使用。我計劃將其中絕大部分投資於\n我計劃將其大部分投資於指數基金，但我想在以下方面尋求幫助。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9879aef3-481d-5fbb-8bbe-068cd9701810","excerpt":"A friend who works at waste management got offered an employee stock purchase\nprogram where they get shares at a discounted rate.
