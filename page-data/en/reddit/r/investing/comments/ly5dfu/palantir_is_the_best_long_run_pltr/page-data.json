Essentially these two software work by integrating with the customer&#39;s existing system and simulating different operational models and outcomes for different decisions that the customer makes. To me, this technology is revolutionary as proven by how unpredictable the state of the world economy is right now. </p>\n\n<p>A few of the big names that are working with them now is <strong>IBM</strong>, <strong>PG&amp;E</strong>, <strong>BP</strong>, and many hedge funds and banks, and a big one recently is a 31m contract with <strong>NHS England</strong> where they are working to handle vaccine allocation <strong>(</strong>this is significant as the UK is facing a historically tough recession<strong>)</strong></p>\n\n<p>They have been consistently working with the US government on multiple contracts using Gotham, from finding bin Laden to verifying Iran&#39;s nuclear presence in 2018. Palantir is <strong>one of the four</strong> institutions that were given DoD IL-5 and on their way to DoD IL-6, to give you a scale Google is DoD IL-2 and Oracle is DoD IL-4, meaning they are responsible for handling extremely sensitive information for the DOD, their most recent contract is <em>project Maven</em>. Essentially Palantir is the CIA&#39;s AI twin.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back at the fundamentals, especially with the P/S ratio of over 40 right now, it can be overpriced to get in. But in the near future, PLTR will be the best stock to hold for 5+ years as the sky is their limit.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: forgot to put my position 300 @24.9</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/","title":"Palantir is the best long run $PLTR","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T07:27:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 07:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8bf7fd00-17b0-58ef-b591-870f94b149ea","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"jacquesmioff","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jacquesmioff","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jacquesmioff","score":565,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Palantir是最好的长跑$PLTR。","the_new_excerpt":"TL，DR：$PLTR是一个巨大的多头游戏，该公司有其脚趾浸在\n基本上每个行业都有。\n\n以下是一些基本面：市值446亿，2020年营收11亿（4.82亿起）。\n商业，6.18亿来自于政府），以及持续的盈利节拍。\n\n2020年，其营收增长47%，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Palantir是最好的長跑$PLTR。","the_new_excerpt":"TL，DR：$PLTR是一個巨大的多頭遊戲，該公司有其腳趾浸在\n基本上每個行業都有。\n\n以下是一些基本面：市值446億，2020年營收11億（4.82億起）。\n商業，6.18億來自於政府），以及持續的盈利節拍。\n\n2020年，其營收增長47%，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1367100963597791235","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1367100963597791235","title":"Covid-19 hospitalizations in the US have declined 49 days in a row, down 65% from their peak on Jan 6. 🙏 https://t.co/ld6uEFszzk","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"科维德-19在美国的住院人数已经连续49天下降，比1月6日的高峰期下降了65%。🙏https://t.co/ld6uEFszzk。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"科維德-19在美國的住院人數已經連續49天下降，比1月6日的高峯期下降了65%。🙏https://t.co/ld6uEFszzk。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-282671f1-269a-5ffb-8b2a-747cb41dfcb4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly1kwr/waited_till_i_cashed_out_to_post/","title":"Waited till I cashed out to post","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 05, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"等到我兑现了才发","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"等到我兌現了才發","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-8bf7fd00-17b0-58ef-b591-870f94b149ea","previousId":"TweetPost-1367100963597791235","nextId":"RedditPost-282671f1-269a-5ffb-8b2a-747cb41dfcb4","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
