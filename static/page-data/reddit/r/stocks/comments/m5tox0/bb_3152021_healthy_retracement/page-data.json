If you missed it, here&#39;s the link on <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/</a>  </p>\n\n<p>This is a healthy retracement, we were not respecting the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour and hourly chart, and were in the overbought territory on the RSI. Everything else is falling into place, we are looking good.  </p>\n\n<p>Although I myself was excited to see $BB in the $12 range premarket and in the morning, I myself was wondering if we were about to see a blow-off, it looks like AMC ruled the day today.    </p>\n\n<p>Average volume daily today too which is nice to see, probably some profit-taking as we are up 40% from the bottom at 8.83 which is fine by me. People can take their pennies if they wish, I&#39;m more into the long game and swing trading ain&#39;t really my jam.</p>\n\n<p>Continue accumulating and holding, we are looking extremely strong and this pullback was very very healthy.   </p>\n\n<p>From all aspects of technical analysis standpoint, this is an absolute screaming buy.<br/>\nFrom a fundamentalist&#39;s view, those who know the sentiment, the deals, the products, and the history, this is a screaming buy.<br/>\nFrom a speculatory view or the ultra-long like 2-3 years down the road, this is a screaming buy.  </p>\n\n<p>Think of this stock as smoking a brisket or making a nice prime rib roast. We want this baby to cook low and slow, or in another way set it and forget. If you do that you&#39;ll get the tastiest, juiciest reward.   </p>\n\n<p>Take care.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m5tox0/bb_3152021_healthy_retracement/","title":"$BB 3/15/2021 - Healthy Retracement","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T23:51:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 23:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b5d978c5-3c47-558e-9602-8d7b6ee61ff5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m5tox0/bb_3152021_healthy_retracement/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m5tox0/bb_3152021_healthy_retracement/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Virtual-Pin1025","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Virtual-Pin1025","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Virtual-Pin1025","score":148,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$BB 3/15/2021----健康矫正术","the_new_excerpt":"大家好!\n\n这是我上一篇文章的交集。如果你错过了它，这里是链接在\nr/stocks [/r/stocks]\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/\n\n这是一个健康的回调，我们在布林线上没有尊重。\n4…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BB 3/15/2021----健康矯正術","the_new_excerpt":"大家好!\n\n這是我上一篇文章的交集。如果你錯過了它，這裏是鏈接在\nr/stocks [/r/stocks]\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/\n\n這是一個健康的回調，我們在布林線上沒有尊重。\n4…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1371511660335263744","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1371511660335263744","title":"https://t.co/ORyzZYGXdv","date":"March 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"https://t.co/ORyzZYGXdv","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"https://t.co/ORyzZYGXdv","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-518ed2ee-aec4-5f3e-93aa-585c265569ae","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5s7ir/surprise_mf/","title":"Surprise mf","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 16, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"惊喜mf","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"驚喜mf","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-b5d978c5-3c47-558e-9602-8d7b6ee61ff5","previousId":"TweetPost-1371511660335263744","nextId":"RedditPost-518ed2ee-aec4-5f3e-93aa-585c265569ae","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m5tox0/bb_3152021_healthy_retracement/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
