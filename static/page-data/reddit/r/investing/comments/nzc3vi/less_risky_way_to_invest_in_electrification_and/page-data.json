The company&#39;s stock fell 20%. March did not bring relief. The decline did not continue, but things still don’t go their way, while the general market continues to grow.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla is a great company, but I don&#39;t want to buy its shares even today. In order for the company&#39;s valuation to be justified, in a few years, Elon Musk and his team must not only maintain leadership in the growing segment of electric cars, but also win competition in new segments. For example, self-driving cars, driverless taxis, you can also take over the orbital transport sector. Oh, this is already SpaceX...</p>\n\n<p>In short, Tesla is still unreasonably expensive. However, a reasonable investor today should take a course towards clean energy. All developed countries&#39; politicians talk about this, and they are ready to provide support. It is a really promising investment trend.</p>\n\n<p>Cheaper companies developing renewable energy sources (renewables) would be a good alternative to Tesla. Here is a list of ETFs (<a href=\"https://www.etf.com/channels/renewable-energy-etfs\">https://www.etf.com/channels/renewable-energy-etfs</a>) that you can use. By investing in them, we get more diversification, lower risks (P/E of companies in the sector is in the 30-40x region; most companies are profitable), as well as the same &quot;discount&quot; as on Tesla shares (renewables fell with it).</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at the graph below. Renewables are just as profitable as tech companies.</p>\n\n<p>Graph:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sun9-59.userapi.com/impg/GsmKApdEmg-MY4jGpcFQsjttkdiRrcfsYdKKJQ/k1bFdI6il08.jpg?size=806x623&amp;quality=96&amp;sign=71e8a8b5e53038856700029eb687bb8d&amp;type=album\">https://sun9-59.userapi.com/impg/GsmKApdEmg-MY4jGpcFQsjttkdiRrcfsYdKKJQ/k1bFdI6il08.jpg?size=806x623&amp;quality=96&amp;sign=71e8a8b5e53038856700029eb687bb8d&amp;type=album</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/nzc3vi/less_risky_way_to_invest_in_electrification_and/","title":"Less risky way to invest in electrification and ecology than Tesla","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-14T10:57:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-14 10:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dbed5eba-25a8-5830-b008-1ea21c9beb07","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nzc3vi/less_risky_way_to_invest_in_electrification_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nzc3vi/less_risky_way_to_invest_in_electrification_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"gemparkanbj","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gemparkanbj","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"gemparkanbj","score":74,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テスラよりもリスクの少ない電動化とエコロジーへの投資方法","the_new_excerpt":"皆さんもご存知の通り、2月はテスラにとって非常に悪い月でした。同社の株価は\n20％下落しました。3月になっても安心はできませんでした。落ち込みは続きませんでしたが\n市場全体が成長を続ける中、同社は依然として思い通りにはいきません。\n\nテスラは素晴らしい会社ですが、今でもその株を買いたいとは思いません....","locale":"ja"},{"title":"与特斯拉相比，投资电气化和生态学的风险更小","the_new_excerpt":"大家都知道，2月份对特斯拉来说是一个非常糟糕的月份。该公司的股票\n跌了20%。三月并没有带来缓解。跌势没有继续，但事情\n仍然不顺，而总体市场继续增长。\n\n特斯拉是一家伟大的公司，但我今天也不想买它的股票....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"與特斯拉相比，投資電氣化和生態學的風險更小","the_new_excerpt":"大家都知道，2月份對特斯拉來說是一個非常糟糕的月份。該公司的股票\n跌了20%。三月並沒有帶來緩解。跌勢沒有繼續，但事情\n仍然不順，而總體市場繼續增長。\n\n特斯拉是一家偉大的公司，但我今天也不想買它的股票....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0e0f3efe-d3f4-5a5b-8655-cec9fb72efe6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/nzgzla/it_is_the_feds_job_to_make_sure_banks_arent/","title":"It IS the Fed’s job to make sure banks aren’t lending recklessly to funds like Archegos, whose blow ups reverberate back to the tax payer-backed banking system","date":"June 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"銀行がアルケゴスのようなファンドに無謀な融資をしないようにするのがFRBの仕事であり、その破綻は納税者が支援する銀行システムにまで波及する。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"美联储的工作是确保银行不鲁莽地贷款给像Archegos这样的基金，他们的爆炸会回荡到纳税人支持的银行系统。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"美聯儲的工作是確保銀行不魯莽地貸款給像Archegos這樣的基金，他們的爆炸會迴盪到納稅人支持的銀行系統。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-59e6c08b-731b-5ca3-84a9-64e1a9b7f57b","excerpt":"Your daily trading discussion thread.
