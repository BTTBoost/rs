Thought this would be useful for all your DD efforts.</p>\n\n<p>ROE (Return on Equity) aka Net Income / Average Shareholders&#39; Equity</p>\n\n<p>People love throwing out ROE numbers to get you to love whatever they are pitching, but you should be automatically suspicious of ROE as a headliner number.</p>\n\n<p>ROE can be written another way: ROE = ROA x Financial Leverage.</p>\n\n<p>ROA is an <strong>operating</strong> metric.</p>\n\n<p>Financial Leverage is a <strong>capital structure</strong> metric.</p>\n\n<p>So ROE is a blended metric of both: operations and capital structure.</p>\n\n<p>This is significant because when you are comparing two competitors and think that one with a higher ROE is a better value play that may be a mistake. </p>\n\n<p>Those two hypothetical companies may have the same exact ROA but company A may just have borrowed heavily, which will jack up ROE. No change in business model, operations, efficiency, etc, just a simple increase in debt will make your ROE go up, even if you just sit on the cash and don&#39;t use it.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, debt is risky for equity holders, no guarantee that a company will use it for productive projects. This risk is further compounded in a near zero rate environment.</p>\n\n<p>ROA is a more relevant metric if you are commenting on the core business model.</p>\n\n<p>At best, ROE without context is a distraction. At worst, it can be downright misleading.</p>\n\n<p>Happy Investing!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>btw this wouldn&#39;t apply to bank stocks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lkm91d/why_you_should_be_suspicious_of_roe/","title":"Why You Should be Suspicious of ROE","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T22:24:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 22:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8cd07b35-222a-5847-b7b7-cd16793c7010","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lkm91d/why_you_should_be_suspicious_of_roe/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lkm91d/why_you_should_be_suspicious_of_roe/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"russel_leffingwell","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/russel_leffingwell","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"russel_leffingwell","score":1147,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么你应该对ROE产生怀疑？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我只是想给大家额外介绍一下一个常用的小指标\n我一直看到的太松散的各种投资周围抛出。\n子reddits。觉得这对你所有的DD工作都是有用的。\n\nROE(Return on Equity)又名净收入/平均股东权益。\n\n人们喜欢...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼你應該對ROE產生懷疑？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我只是想給大家額外介紹一下一個常用的小指標\n我一直看到的太鬆散的各種投資周圍拋出。\n子reddits。覺得這對你所有的DD工作都是有用的。\n\nROE(Return on Equity)又名淨收入/平均股東權益。\n\n人們喜歡...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-56267b9b-99b2-5841-9c41-e4bf07d7c0d1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkm7pa/so_i_saw_this_scrolling_through_gofundme/","title":"So I saw this scrolling through GoFundMe...","date":"February 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我在GoFundMe上看到了这个... ...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我在GoFundMe上看到了這個... ...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-1abc3209-2d1d-59e2-975f-46c8416fceeb","excerpt":"I’d like to know which ARK fund you think is the best investment going forward.\nEach of them have grown over 100% within the past year, with no signs of slowing\ndown.
