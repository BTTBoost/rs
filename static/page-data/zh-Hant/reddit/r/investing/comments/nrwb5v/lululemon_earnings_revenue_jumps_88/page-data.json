Lululemon also reported a net income of $145 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to $29 million last year, or 22 cents per diluted share. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Our first quarter results reflected strength across all drivers of growth, fuelled by the continued expansion in our e-commerce business and a rebound in brick and mortar stores,&quot; chief executive Calvin McDonald said in a statement released after markets closed on Thursday. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Our strong performance across categories, channels and geographies demonstrates the momentum and strength of Lululemon as we shift into the new normal.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Lululemon said traffic to its bricks and mortar stores increased significantly in the first quarter of the year, with 93 per cent of the company&#39;s retail stores open by the end of the three month period. </p>\n\n<p>The company also saw growth in both its women&#39;s and men&#39;s categories. Sales of women&#39;s products increased 23 per cent when compared to 2019 sales, and men&#39;s sales jumped 27 per cent compared to 2019.</p>\n\n<p>McDonald expects that momentum to continue, even as economies reopen and customers begin to resume normal routines. He said sales growth has continued, even as consumers shift their daily habits. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;We have not seen a meaningful shift in our activewear categories through the first quarter,&quot; McDonald said. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;The big piece of our business and sales are in athletic activewear. I think with that, it has embedded strength to not be purely trend driven or fashion driven... Overall growth is across almost every category and is very balanced across geographies.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>The stronger-than-expected results pushed Lululemon to raise its sales targets for the full fiscal year. The company now expects net revenue to be between $5.83 billion and $5.91 billion in 2021, up from its prior range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion. Lululemon also expects adjusted earnings to be between $6.73 and $6.86 per share, compared to a prior range of $6.30 to $6.45. </p>\n\n<p>The projections surpass what analysts had anticipated. According to IBES data from Refinitiv, analysts had expected net revenue of $5.68 billion and earnings of $6.48 per share. </p>\n\n<p>With files from Reuters</p>\n\n<p>Alicja Siekierska is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance Canada.
