I also own a Porsche and Audi (no Toyota products). I’m also not good with investing. So don’t listen to me.</p>\n\n<p>Wow, some of the best plays truly are right in front of you, because Toyota is hilariously undervalued now that they’ve decided to enter the EV market.</p>\n\n<p>Toyota, is an engineering and business legend. Nobody engineers better than Toyota, nobody optimizes businesses and Toyota.</p>\n\n<p>When I went through business school we studied Toyota in almost ever classroom. Toyota practically invented modern business practices and engineering practices.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t heard of Toyota as a professional in business or engineering, you should probably be fired.</p>\n\n<p>The following statements may sound like opinions, I’m pretty sure they’re facts.</p>\n\n<p>- Dominates the manufacturing supply practice. Nothing is wasted in Toyota’s business, everything runs <strong>LEAN and AGILE.</strong> During economic downturns Toyota will always come out on top simply  because they’ve <strong>perfected</strong> the art of <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>- The finest engineers work at Toyota. Everything Toyota produces is an engineering marvel. Products optimized perfectly for each single demographic to be as affordable and reliable as possible  while being practical and usable.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Toyota officially entered the EV business. The company with a perfect supply chain, the company with the highest amount of consumer trust, the company that has the finest engineers in the entire automotive industry and a practically infinite amount of wealth…has entered the room. So let’s look at their positioning.</p>\n\n<p>- Toyota is bound to be a huge recipient of the Biden’s plan to supply the federal government with EVs.</p>\n\n<p>- Fun fact, the top “American” companies are asian. The big three make most of their junk abroad.</p>\n\n<p>- Toyota is planning on being the <strong>first</strong> to deploy the <strong>SOLID STATE BATTERY.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>- MASSIVE Energy density</strong> compared to existing technology.</p>\n\n<p>- Solid state batteries can easily reach <strong>500+ mile range.</strong></p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Much</strong> faster charge time.</p>\n\n<p>- Have already begun the production process</p>\n\n<p>- Toyota plans on unveiling the first solid state powered EV this year with release soon after.</p>\n\n<p>- Toyota produces over 10,000,000 vehicles a year. Tesla reached 500,000 this year with a goal of 20% growth a year.</p>\n\n<p>- Toyota is the most trusted brand internationally in the automotive world.</p>\n\n<p>So Toyota, a manufacturing behemoth is switching to fully electric with aims of putting their world class engineers to produce the world’s first solid state battery commercial vehicle. Nice.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s talk about some numbers:</p>\n\n<p>- Price to book ratio of 1.137. Anything under 3 is considered undervalued. Tesla is around 40.</p>\n\n<p>- PE ratio of 17.17. Anything under 20 is undervalued, Apple is at 37 and <strong>Tesla is 1301.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>-</strong> Expected to increase margin from 5.5 -&gt; 7.2</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>121% increase in operating income from China</li>\n<li>24% Increase in cash/cash equivalents since Apr 2019. Impressive considering covid</li>\n<li>Relatively stable/balanced asset/liability ratio, has barely budged since covid).</li>\n<li>Has somehow decreased cost and expenses by 16% during covid.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If Tesla is the King Kong of the EV world, then Toyota is Godzilla, a nuclear powered dinosaur of a company from outer space. He’s landed and he’s gonna blow up your bubble. Yes I’m aware of the “Not just a car company” phrase, but as Burry said, “Enjoy it while it lasts”, because no company should be trading with a century of growth priced in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong></p>\n\n<p>Toyota is here and it’s going to devour the EV market. Good long term purchase, but I have 75,000$ in calls.</p>\n\n<p>Not a Toyota fanboy( I drive a Porsche and Audi). Don&#39;t take my advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhdjf1/a_rough_analysis_on_toyota_motors/","title":"A rough Analysis on Toyota Motors","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T13:33:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 13:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"00ee0789-d021-50b2-b150-acab9218c3ce","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhdjf1/a_rough_analysis_on_toyota_motors/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhdjf1/a_rough_analysis_on_toyota_motors/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Slow_Seaworthiness15","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Slow_Seaworthiness15","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Slow_Seaworthiness15","score":117,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"对丰田汽车的粗略分析","the_new_excerpt":"$TM 丰田汽车公司\n\n**Full disclosure: I own 75k in Toyota calls. 我还拥有一辆保时捷和奥迪(无\n丰田产品）。) 我也不擅长投资。所以不要听我说。\n\n哇，有些好戏真的就在你面前，因为丰田是\n价值被低估，现在他们已经... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對豐田汽車的粗略分析","the_new_excerpt":"$TM 豐田汽車公司\n\n**Full disclosure: I own 75k in Toyota calls. 我還擁有一輛保時捷和奧迪(無\n豐田產品）。) 我也不擅長投資。所以不要聽我說。\n\n哇，有些好戲真的就在你面前，因爲豐田是\n價值被低估，現在他們已經... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0d9c57c9-1bad-50eb-b0ce-56e7e7136584","excerpt":"This sincerely is a bit distressing because I put a fair bit of money some time\nago (hundreds of dollars each into diff stocks, not thousands or tens of\nthousands like some people on here so easily seem to toss).\n\nThese are companies I've believed in, and have felt they will do great\nlong-term, but…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lh7a2z/some_of_my_midlong_stocks_have_now_become_meme/","title":"Some of my mid-long stocks have now become meme stocks and it's really messing with me...","date":"February 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我的一些中长线股票现在已经变成了追忆股，这真的让我很纠结...","the_new_excerpt":"这真心有点让人苦恼，因为我花了不少钱，花了一些时间\n前（每只股票几百元，而不是几千或几十元）。\n数千人就像这里的一些人如此轻易地似乎折腾）。)\n\n这些公司我都相信，并且觉得他们会做得很好。\n长期以来，但","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的一些中長線股票現在已經變成了追憶股，這真的讓我很糾結...","the_new_excerpt":"這真心有點讓人苦惱，因爲我花了不少錢，花了一些時間\n前（每隻股票幾百元，而不是幾千或幾十元）。\n數千人就像這裏的一些人如此輕易地似乎折騰）。)\n\n這些公司我都相信，並且覺得他們會做得很好。\n長期以來，但","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-32b27a37-12f8-5bcd-abfa-02fa510fe111","excerpt":"Hi!\n\nBy April APHA and TLRY are going to merge, meaning every APHA share will be\nconverted into 0.83 TLRY share.\n\nSo it's my understanding that as long as APHA/TLRY < 0.83, it's worth buying\nAPHA since it's basically discounted TLRY share.\n\nToday APHA/TLRY = 0.45\n\nI read here that the closer we're…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lh6kgp/explanations_on_the_apha_tlry_merger_please/","title":"Explanations on the APHA - TLRY merger please","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 11, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"请解释APHA与TLRY合并的原因。","the_new_excerpt":"你好！到4月APHA和TLRY就要合并了。\n\n到4月APHA和TLRY将合并，这意味着APHA的每一只股票都将是。\n换算成0.83的TLRY份额。\n\n所以我的理解是，只要APHA/TLRY<0.83，就值得买入。\nAPHA因为基本上是折价的TLRY份额。\n\n今天APHA/TLRY=0.45\n\n我在这里读到，我们越接近... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"請解釋APHA與TLRY合併的原因。","the_new_excerpt":"你好！到4月APHA和TLRY就要合併了。\n\n到4月APHA和TLRY將合併，這意味着APHA的每一隻股票都將是。\n換算成0.83的TLRY份額。\n\n所以我的理解是，只要APHA/TLRY<0.83，就值得買入。\nAPHA因爲基本上是折價的TLRY份額。\n\n今天APHA/TLRY=0.45\n\n我在這裏讀到，我們越接近... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-00ee0789-d021-50b2-b150-acab9218c3ce","previousId":"RedditPost-0d9c57c9-1bad-50eb-b0ce-56e7e7136584","nextId":"RedditPost-32b27a37-12f8-5bcd-abfa-02fa510fe111","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhdjf1/a_rough_analysis_on_toyota_motors/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
