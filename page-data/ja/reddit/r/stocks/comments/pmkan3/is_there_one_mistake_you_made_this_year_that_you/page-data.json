Last week I touched on a topic that was very helpful to everyone and gained much traction. This week I want to discuss just 1 major huge blunder.. No matter how great we are we all have made at least 1 mistake this past year.</p>\n\n<p>So please share with us 1 or more mistakes you have made so that others do not, or hopefully not make the same mistake. As a start I will tell you all my main mistake, how I fell into that mistake/why and where I should and will likely cut my losses in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I actually have 2 major mistakes this past year but they are in the same field. The mortgage sector. I was actually trading 5 names, but got stock in 2. I was trading LDI, HMPT, RKT, UWMC and COOP. The reason being that the mortgage sector was hugely profitable. They make cash hands over fists. They can do buybacks, special dividends and they do!</p>\n\n<p>So what happened? The 4th quarter of 2020 was absolutely smashing for the whole sector. All 5 at that time were making new highs. RKT and UWMC got the Reddit retail status. RKT, UWMC were actually doing buybacks and special dividends. LDI, which I am down a lot on actually smashed earnings badly, announced a special dividend first, a regular dividend….so how would you know not to buy? HMPT reported, the report was amazing. This was actually 10.50 after hours…. Then RKT reported [The market leader] the entire sector was a sinking ship. LDI and HMPT never recovered UWMC and RKT with their social media fame did for some time, but those 2 were stuck.</p>\n\n<p>What should I have done? Next time a market leader misses a report, and warns of margins I will sell at least half my position..if not more. It is usually the case that if the market leader shows weakness it may spread…what happened on the 2nd quarter report ending 6/30… HMPT and LDI laid eggs, which were foreshadowed in RKT’s report.</p>\n\n<p>What was I waiting for? COOP reported earnings first before the whole sector… COOP beat by 3 dollars…. COOP is not the industry leader. I had it in my head to take the loss on LDI at 12, HMPT at 6….. I did not pull the trigger, after they released reports it went straight down……</p>\n\n<p>So what I learned is sell at least half!! Unless you do not mind waiting. They will be fine and are not going anywhere but I would rather not wait 3-6-9 months. </p>\n\n<p>Please share blunders so we can all try and get some ideas of what to do if we are in a similar situation. Thank you and have a great night/weekend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pmkan3/is_there_one_mistake_you_made_this_year_that_you/","title":"Is there one mistake you made this year, that you may have learned something and can share with the community so they can avoid?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-12T16:08:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-12 16:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pmkan3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pmkan3/is_there_one_mistake_you_made_this_year_that_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pmkan3/is_there_one_mistake_you_made_this_year_that_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"UltimateTraders","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/UltimateTraders","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"UltimateTraders","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今年、あなたが犯した失敗の中で、何かを学び、それをコミュニティと共有することで回避することができるものはありますか？","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんばんは。私の記事を読んでくださって、本当にありがとうございます。先週、私は\n話題に触れましたが、これが皆さんにとって非常に参考になり、大きな反響を呼びました。\n今週は、たった1つの大きな失敗についてお話したいと思います。どんなに素晴らしい人でも\nどんなに素晴らしい人でも、この1年で少なくとも1つは失敗をしているものです。\n\nそこで...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你今年有没有犯过一个错误，你可能学到了一些东西，可以与社区分享，以便他们可以避免？","the_new_excerpt":"大家晚上好，非常感谢你们阅读我的帖子。上周我\n谈到了一个对大家都很有帮助的话题，并获得了很多启发。\n本周我只想讨论一个重大的巨大失误。无论我们有多伟大\n我们都在过去一年中至少犯了一个错误。\n\n所以...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你今年有沒有犯過一個錯誤，你可能學到了一些東西，可以與社區分享，以便他們可以避免？","the_new_excerpt":"大家晚上好，非常感謝你們閱讀我的帖子。上週我\n談到了一個對大家都很有幫助的話題，並獲得了很多啓發。\n本週我只想討論一個重大的巨大失誤。無論我們有多偉大\n我們都在過去一年中至少犯了一個錯誤。\n\n所以...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pmlktv","excerpt":" 1.
