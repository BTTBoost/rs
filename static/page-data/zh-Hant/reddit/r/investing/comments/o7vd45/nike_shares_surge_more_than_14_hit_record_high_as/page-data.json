The retailer, which has a market cap of more than $211 billion, last saw its stock hit an all-time high of $147.95 on Dec. 21.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Globally, Nike is seeing shoppers splurge on new sneakers and fashion-forward sweatsuits to wear as more people begin to socialize again. The company’s Jordan brand has been a particular bright spot.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>During the three-month period ended May 31, Nike’s total revenue nearly doubled to $12.34 billion from $6.31 billion a year earlier, topping Wall Street estimates by more than $1 billion. In North America, Nike’s biggest market, sales more than doubled to a record $5.38 billion.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following Nike’s upbeat fiscal fourth-quarter results on Thursday afternoon, Cowen &amp; Co. analyst John Kernan raised his price target to $181 from $145. Kernan said he sees a path for the company’s market cap to one day surpass $300 billion.</p>\n\n<p>“Management’s confidence is hitting an inflection and Q4 results indicate the digitally driven acceleration in the financial model,” he said in a note to clients.</p>\n\n<p>According to Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernández, Nike is benefiting from its closer connections with customers through its membership program, higher full price selling, greater use of data and a smarter wholesale model with strong partners like <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FL\">Foot Locker</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Telsey raised its price target on Nike shares to $180 from $160.</p>\n\n<p>“The strong momentum in Nike’s brand globally is more than offsetting pressure in China and supply chain constraints,” Fernandez said in a note to clients.</p>\n\n<p>At least 12 brokerages have already raised their price targets on Nike shares, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter release. According to FactSet, the median target price of analysts who cover the company is now $176.90.</p>\n\n<p>“The company is emerging from the Covid period into the biggest [profit and loss] evolutions in our coverage universe,” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said.</p>\n\n<p>Nike warrants “a significant valuation premium” compared with other global apparel and footwear brands, he added.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/nike-shares-on-pace-to-hit-record-high-as-outlook-tops-expectations.html\">CNBC</a>, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKE?p=NKE&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">NKE stock price</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o7vd45/nike_shares_surge_more_than_14_hit_record_high_as/","title":"Nike shares surge more than 14%, hit record high as $50 billion sales outlook tops expectations","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-26T01:07:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-26 01:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ee67e786-1ea5-5802-b779-0114e72aa845","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o7vd45/nike_shares_surge_more_than_14_hit_record_high_as/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o7vd45/nike_shares_surge_more_than_14_hit_record_high_as/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":333,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"売上高500億ドルの見通しが予想を上回り、ナイキの株価は14％以上上昇し、過去最高を記録","the_new_excerpt":"キーポイント\n\n * 世界的に見て、ナイキは、多くの人々が再び社会生活を始める中で、買い物客が新しいスニーカーやファッション性の高いスウェットスーツを買い求める姿を目にしています。\n   ナイキは世界的に、多くの人々が社会生活を再開する中で、買い物客が新しいスニーカーやファッション性の高いスウェットスーツを購入しています。\n * 同社のジョーダン・ブランドは、特に明るい話題となっています。\n * 少なくとも12の証券会社がNikeの目標株価を引き上げています。\n  ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"耐克股价大涨逾14%，创历史新高，500亿美元销售前景超预期","the_new_excerpt":"关键点\n\n * 在全球范围内，耐克看到购物者在新的运动鞋和时尚前卫的运动服上大肆挥霍。\n   随着越来越多的人开始重新参加社交活动，耐克公司看到购物者在购买新的运动鞋和时尚的运动服。\n * 该公司的乔丹品牌一直是一个特别的亮点。\n * 至少有12家券商已经提高了对耐克的目标价格。\n  ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"耐克股價大漲逾14%，創歷史新高，500億美元銷售前景超預期","the_new_excerpt":"關鍵點\n\n * 在全球範圍內，耐克看到購物者在新的運動鞋和時尚前衛的運動服上大肆揮霍。\n   隨着越來越多的人開始重新參加社交活動，耐克公司看到購物者在購買新的運動鞋和時尚的運動服。\n * 該公司的喬丹品牌一直是一個特別的亮點。\n * 至少有12家券商已經提高了對耐克的目標價格。\n  ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1408545810430767105","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1408545810430767105","title":"Two revolutionary companies went public in the summer of 2004.
