I decided to take a quick look at the company.  Their Vehicle is... not very impressive, no groundbreaking range, efficiency or price improvements.  Their big selling point is solar cells plastered all over the vehicle, which many companies are exploring.  </p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about the company here:  <a href=\"https://sonomotors.com/\">https://sonomotors.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>But, who exactly is building these cars?  Surely a startup this size can&#39;t mass produce $30,000 vehicles.  The answer is National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS).  They bought SAAB&#39;s assets in 2012 with the intent to make a SAAB 9-3 EV.  In almost a decade, no vehicle has made it to production.  </p>\n\n<p>It gets worse.  NEVS is a subsidiary of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, A subsidiary of Evergrande Health Industry Group, who bought 100% of NEVS in 2020.  Evergrande Health is, of course, a subsidiary Evergrande Group.  Also of note, NEVS haven&#39;t filed any reports since 2019.</p>\n\n<p>NEVS ownership structure and investor relations:  <a href=\"https://www.nevs.com/en/investors/owner-structure/\">https://www.nevs.com/en/investors/owner-structure/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>This  company has managed to put their manufacturing into the hands of, ostensibly, an incompetent and unproven manufacturer, which is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Evergrande Group.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If ever there were an EV stock to avoid... this would be it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qwt3jd/sono_group_an_ev_startup_that_managed_to_contract/","title":"Sono Group: An EV startup that managed to contract out their manufacturing to Evergrande","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-18T20:35:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-18 20:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qwt3jd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qwt3jd/sono_group_an_ev_startup_that_managed_to_contract/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qwt3jd/sono_group_an_ev_startup_that_managed_to_contract/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"thri54","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thri54","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"thri54","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Sono Group: EVスタートアップで、Evergrandeに製造を委託した企業。","the_new_excerpt":"昨日上場したEVスタートアップのSono Group（$SEV）。私は、この会社をちょっと見てみることにしました。\nその会社をちょっと見てみることにしました。彼らの自動車は...あまり印象的ではありません。\n画期的な航続距離、効率、価格の改善はありません。彼らの大きなセールスポイントは\n車体全体に太陽電池を貼り付けていることですが、これは多くの企業が...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"索诺集团。一家电动车初创企业，成功将其制造业务外包给恒大。","the_new_excerpt":"索诺集团（$SEV），一家昨天上市的电动车初创公司。我决定看一下\n迅速了解一下该公司。他们的车辆......不是非常令人印象深刻，没有\n突破性的范围、效率或价格改进。他们的最大卖点是\n是在车辆上贴满了太阳能电池，许多公司...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"索諾集團。一家電動車初創企業，成功將其製造業務外包給恆大。","the_new_excerpt":"索諾集團（$SEV），一家昨天上市的電動車初創公司。我決定看一下\n迅速瞭解一下該公司。他們的車輛......不是非常令人印象深刻，沒有\n突破性的範圍、效率或價格改進。他們的最大賣點是\n是在車輛上貼滿了太陽能電池，許多公司...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qwrfxd","excerpt":"Hi there, I got some bonus 20k recently and thinking abt dumping that into one\nof the above tickers, based on current PE, factoring some pull back and future\npotential which stock would you recommend the most.
