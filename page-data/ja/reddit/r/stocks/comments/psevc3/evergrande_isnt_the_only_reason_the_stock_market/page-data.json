The Chinese property giant is threatening to default on $300 billion in debt that could ripple through global markets. However, the downturn in the highly leveraged real-estate sector, which the Financial Times notes makes up more than 28% of China’s economy, isn’t the only problem for markets on Monday. Here are the other reasons-</p>\n\n<p><strong>Delta woes</strong></p>\n\n<p>The delta variant of COVID-19 is resulting in higher case tallies in the world’s largest economy. The U.S. is now averaging more than 2,000 deaths daily, according to a New York Times tracker, the most since March 1, and consist almost entirely of unvaccinated people. Florida, which has vaccinated 56% of its population, is averaging 353 deaths a day. Texas, where 50% of the population is inoculated, is seeing 286 deaths a day, according to the Times. Those two states account for more than 30% of all COVID-19 deaths since March 1. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Fed taper talk</strong></p>\n\n<p>Markets are fixated on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee’s Sept. 21-22 meeting, where Fed officials face the prospect of winding down the accommodations that have propped markets up since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., even as the economic rebound looks uneven. The Fed has been buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month since last June to keep long-term interest rates low and bolster demand.  A number of Fed officials have expressed a desire to announce tapering at the September meeting and begin the initiative before year-end. Investors are anxious about the timetable for such reductions and are also looking out for any signals of an interest-rate increase in 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Debt ceiling</strong></p>\n\n<p>On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged Congress to raise or suspend the nation’s debt ceiling or risk “widespread economic catastrophe.” In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, Yellen, a former Fed chair, noted that the U.S. has never defaulted, and she said it must not do so now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>September and stock-market seasonality</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a growing sense that valuations are rich and the Federal Reserve’s easy-money punchbowl will be yanked away at the worst possible time. Seasonally, September has been one of the worst months for stocks, and investors think that the market might behave true to that pattern.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A correction is due</strong></p>\n\n<p>Strategists think that the market is due for a significant pullback as the S&amp;P 500 has recorded more than 200 sessions without having seen a drawdown of 5% or more from a recent peak, making the current stretch of levitation the longest such since around 2016, when the market went 404 sessions without falling by at least 5% peak to trough.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inflation lingers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Inflation continues to dog markets. Data recently showed that the cost of living for Americans rose in August at the slowest pace in seven months and signalled the surge in inflation this year may have peaked, but Americans probably aren’t going to get much relief from these elevated prices soon.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from a brief oil-driven spike in 2008, consumer prices have risen this year at the fastest pace in three decades. And a new survey by the New York Federal Reserve shows consumers expect inflation to average 5.2% in the next 12 months.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buy the dip?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Investors have grown accustomed to buying market downturns, referred to as buying the dip. However, Monday’s action, and trading over the past week, suggests that investors are becoming more reluctant to purchasing beaten-down stocks with expectations that stock values will resume record run-ups after modest declines. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closed below its short-term trend line for the first time since around June, which could reflect the erosion of buy-the-dip behaviours.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/evergrande-isnt-the-only-reason-the-stock-market-is-headed-for-its-worst-day-in-2-months-here-are-5-other-reasons-11632146759?mod=article_inline\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/evergrande-isnt-the-only-reason-the-stock-market-is-headed-for-its-worst-day-in-2-months-here-are-5-other-reasons-11632146759?mod=article_inline</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/psevc3/evergrande_isnt_the_only_reason_the_stock_market/","title":"Evergrande isn’t the only reason the stock market is headed lower, here are 7 other reasons","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-21T13:29:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-21 13:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"psevc3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/psevc3/evergrande_isnt_the_only_reason_the_stock_market/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/psevc3/evergrande_isnt_the_only_reason_the_stock_market/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"nickytotherescue","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nickytotherescue","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"nickytotherescue","score":320,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"株式市場が低迷している理由はEvergrandeだけではありません、他にも7つの理由があります。","the_new_excerpt":"ニュースを要約し、記事の全文を読みたい人のためにリンクを追加しました。\n記事全文\n\n米国の株式ベンチマークは、2ヶ月以上にわたって連日最悪の下げ幅を記録することになった。\nこれは、Evergrandeの破綻の可能性が原因とされています。\n中国の大手不動産会社であるEvergrandeは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"恒大并不是股市走低的唯一原因，以下是其他7个原因","the_new_excerpt":"我总结了这一消息，并添加了一个链接，以备你们想阅读的\n完整的文章 --\n\n美国股票基准有望创下两个多月来最差的日跌幅。\n跌势被归咎于恒大的潜在倒闭。\n这个中国房地产巨头是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"恆大並不是股市走低的唯一原因，以下是其他7個原因","the_new_excerpt":"我總結了這一消息，並添加了一個鏈接，以備你們想閱讀的\n完整的文章 --\n\n美國股票基準有望創下兩個多月來最差的日跌幅。\n跌勢被歸咎於恆大的潛在倒閉。\n這個中國房地產巨頭是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-psgeo9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/psgeo9/whats_this_guy_looking_at/","title":"What's this guy looking at","date":"September 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"この人は何を見ているんだろう","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"这家伙在看什么","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"這傢伙在看什麼","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-psbei6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/psbei6/credit_to_umanofculture003_for_the_original/","title":"Credit to u/manofculture003 for the original comment for the meme","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 21, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"このミームのオリジナルコメントは、u/manofculture003氏によるものです。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"归功于u/manofculture003为该备忘录提供的原始评论","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"歸功於u/manofculture003爲該備忘錄提供的原始評論","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-psevc3","previousId":"RedditPost-psgeo9","nextId":"RedditPost-psbei6","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/psevc3/evergrande_isnt_the_only_reason_the_stock_market/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
