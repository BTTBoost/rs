I encourage everyone to search and read all these posts as I encourage all investors to research anything they are investing in.  They are great reads put together by apes with many more wrinkles on their brain than I have.  These posts explain out the different methods that people who are going to lose a lot of money are using against retail.  The high frequency trading, the media, and the schill accounts.</p>\n\n<p>We all know why we are here, duh it’s cause “we like the stock”. Here is some possible catalyst information everyone should know about.  Any one of these things could be the catalyst that starts the squeeze or they could just bomb. We don’t know exactly what will start the frenzy. What we do know is that costs to hold shorts will need to increase and shares need to be called in before the shorters find that line where it’s no longer cost effective to hold their position and they have to buy at any cost and we get our tendies.  So here is a list of certain key items coming up.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This weekend has created another major round of buzz concerning GME which started with the Congressional House Services Financial Committee Hearing on Thursday.  Then it really hit when <a href=\"/u/deepfuckingvalue\">u/deepfuckingvalue</a> followed up to his response to the Congressman that he still though GME was a great value at its current price and then Friday put his money where his mouth is and bought another 50K shares.  Fucking legend.  That buzz has led into a lot of chatter this weekend that could start a FOMO buy on Monday.  A FOMO could drive the price which will cause the borrow rate of shorts to skyrocket and could cause lenders to start pulling back shares.  This “might” be all the catalyst we need to see the moon.</p></li>\n<li><p>An ETF that cannot be named here is being used and a way for shorters to short GME since the fund holds GME stock as a part of it portfolio.  If State Street performs quarterly balancing and reallocations of their ETF their could be a call back of shares.  Honestly we don’t know if this will happen since none of us know the inner working of exactly what they are going to do but this could be the start of events that squeeze GME.</p></li>\n<li><p>GME releases the quarterly earning on March 24th.  This report includes the sale of both new consoles as well as the Christmas rush.  In fact many stores opened back up after Covid lockdowns in the 4th quarter.  We also don’t know if any other information will be released at the time of the earnings report since they have been very tight lipped during this whole run other than announcing some new people that are going to help move GameStop in a new direction.</p></li>\n<li><p>Annual call back of shares prior to the June 2021 annual meeting.  In the months leading up to annual shareholder meetings many stocks end up becoming “Hard to Borrow” with additional rates and fees to borrow them.  The reason for this is that people who lend out shares do not get a vote at the annual shareholders meeting.  You can go back and research this historically for many companies and a quick google search will show you that last year GME shares had to be called back prior to 4/20/20 in order to vote at the shareholders meeting.  With all eyes on GME this year and the corporate changes my feeling is that this year will be no different.  I just hope the use the same callback date of 4/20 for obvious reasons.  The shareholders meeting is in June this year and I think it will be a great time for retail investors to go meet and greet since we know when we get together it will be one hell of a party.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Like I said I am not claiming any one of these things will happen or cause a catalyst but I thought it was important to get these things out in the open so everyone had an understanding of upcoming events.  Like it is repeated over and over again we don’t know when the squeeze will occur because we don’t know the shorters positions and where they feel their line is on cost to hold vs cost to give us our tendies. All we know is when it happens hold on.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading, hope you are all well informed.  Please do outside research and don’t rely on any one person as this is not financial advice.  I’m just a fellow ape holding GME that’s eats the crayons my wife’s boyfriend brings me when he comes over.  I prefer the orange crayons. I am not a cat. I like the stock. I thank you for the opportunity to bring you this information as it’s great information however I don’t have any good stories about growing up as a small child in Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<p>Obligatory \n🦍🦍🦍💪💪💪💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🚀🚀🚀🌛🌛🌛</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp1kzk/gme_possible_upcoming_catalysts/","title":"GME possible upcoming catalysts","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T22:25:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 22:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"32742d6e-db06-5490-904e-bb232dc5f011","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp1kzk/gme_possible_upcoming_catalysts/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp1kzk/gme_possible_upcoming_catalysts/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"cfiznuts","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cfiznuts","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cfiznuts","score":3851,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME可能即将推出的催化剂","the_new_excerpt":"即将到来的全球环境管理 \"可能的 \"催化剂\n\n有一些很好的尽职调查帖子，关于短线交易。\n在GME上的百分比，隐藏着空头游戏与安泰ETF，不能被。\n在这里命名的和其他ETF，以及AI模型的GME可能在哪里月球，因为。\n的。我鼓励大家...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME可能即將推出的催化劑","the_new_excerpt":"即將到來的全球環境管理 \"可能的 \"催化劑\n\n有一些很好的盡職調查帖子，關於短線交易。\n在GME上的百分比，隱藏着空頭遊戲與安泰ETF，不能被。\n在這裏命名的和其他ETF，以及AI模型的GME可能在哪裏月球，因爲。\n的。我鼓勵大家...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1215b901-eb85-591a-b17a-19e84dae87e6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp3lhd/i_have_finally_dug_myself_out_of_a_very/","title":"I have finally dug myself out of a very unpleasant hole from last year 👊","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我终于把自己从去年一个很不愉快的洞里挖了出来👊。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我終於把自己從去年一個很不愉快的洞裏挖了出來👊。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-be9e35b8-e0f6-5379-b56a-61b04bc719ca","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp4460/the_hearing_recap/","title":"The Hearing Recap","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 21, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"听证会回顾","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"聽證會回顧","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-32742d6e-db06-5490-904e-bb232dc5f011","previousId":"RedditPost-1215b901-eb85-591a-b17a-19e84dae87e6","nextId":"RedditPost-be9e35b8-e0f6-5379-b56a-61b04bc719ca","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp1kzk/gme_possible_upcoming_catalysts/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
