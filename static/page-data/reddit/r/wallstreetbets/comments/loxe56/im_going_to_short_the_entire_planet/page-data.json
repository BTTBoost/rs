I&#39;ve been dabbling in galaxy futures for awhile now and trust me I know what I am talking about. </p>\n\n<p>The Fundamentals:</p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing this, the current world population is 7,874,964,825. If you divide that number by the population of South Africa (58.56 million) you get ~134. On January 26, 2021 at approximately 2:30PM, GameStop hit a stock price of $134.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mjhmx2jqnri61.png?width=479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24cbe35d5f29be3f14750a09e2c6603496e47ef5\">GameStop first passes $134</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>As you know, 2:30PM in military time is 1430. 1430 just happens to be a radio station called KMRB in Pasadena, California. Pasadena has a population of ~141k and if you divide that by 2.66 (The average daily % gain AMC had in early January) you get ~53k. </p>\n\n<p>Want to guess what 53k is? It&#39;s the population of Grapevine, Texas.. where the <a href=\"https://www.corporate-office-headquarters.com/gamestop-corp\">GameStop Headquarters</a> is located. </p>\n\n<p>The exact coordinates are 32.9343° N, 97.0781° W. Meaning we only have ~33 days, 97 minutes left before a possible beginning of the collapse of the entire system.</p>\n\n<p>My plan is to bet against 51% of each continent and 89% of each major ocean using a forward triple straddle tampon fluid structure.</p>\n\n<p>I will then double down on the negative sentiment momentum using a food shortage wall and a shoots and ladders attack to prevent the price from going back up.</p>\n\n<p>I will report back here with the results. This isn&#39;t a short term trade. I&#39;m waiting for the sun to reach critical mass and send solar flares into our atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: </p>\n\n<p>420,690  1200° Fahrenheit naked puts 3/26</p>\n\n<p>690,420  1400° Fahrenheit naked puts 4/16</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxe56/im_going_to_short_the_entire_planet/","title":"I'm going to short the entire planet.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T18:22:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 18:22","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"52da544d-1c20-5fa4-a857-d574b9d6b4b6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxe56/im_going_to_short_the_entire_planet/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxe56/im_going_to_short_the_entire_planet/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/KQmCkzLGYyxsS0Sm4YiwyzMKDOel_jXwnz4hf0KFG-s.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0ce849668d16174861ee8cbc07a9794647bb6374","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"mognetron","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mognetron","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mognetron","score":5755,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我要做空整个地球。","the_new_excerpt":"我向你保证，这并不容易。但从各方面来看，这个星球是\n搞砸了 我一直在研究星系的未来，相信我，我知道。\n我说的是什么。\n\n的基本原理。\n\n在写这篇文章的时候，目前世界人口是7,874,964,825。如果\n你把它分成...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我要做空整個地球。","the_new_excerpt":"我向你保證，這並不容易。但從各方面來看，這個星球是\n搞砸了 我一直在研究星系的未來，相信我，我知道。\n我說的是什麼。\n\n的基本原理。\n\n在寫這篇文章的時候，目前世界人口是7,874,964,825。如果\n你把它分成...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-db81d618-a343-5120-9a44-7b3eb7b8ab42","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loxvig/top_tier_journalism_on_full_display/","title":"Top tier journalism on full display","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"一流的新闻报道充分展现","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"一流的新聞報道充分展現","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6a284288-c33f-5bfd-b78b-e3223dc5d968","excerpt":"Hello, I am regulary buying stocks for long term.
