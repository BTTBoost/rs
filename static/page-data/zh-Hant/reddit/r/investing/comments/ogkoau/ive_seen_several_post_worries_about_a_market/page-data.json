The price of the stock shouldn’t even matter. You own a part of a great company.</p>\n\n<p>3 use the power of DCA ( dollar cost averaging) with this strategy you buy consistently every week - month - or day. This will minimize the effect of volatility on your portfolio. </p>\n\n<p>4 DIVIDENDS. often good established companies will pay you a portion of their profits. By reinvesting these you can grow your share count. Using ETFs like SCHD or JEPI create cash flow in your portfolio quarterly and monthly. When \nThe market begins to fall you are all ready accumulating more shares at discount prices. These newly acquired shares will also pay you dividends creating a snowball effect. </p>\n\n<p>5 if you can add more than your dca purchases then save it as a cash or bond position In your portfolio. This will allow you to go on a spending spree when the market crashes to buy more of your shares you picked out in (see “2”).</p>\n\n<p>6 recent US history 1973+ has shown that during market turn downs the fed will try and create an artificial floor under the market. You can benefit from this buy purchasing gold and silver or mining companies. This always works as an inflation play. Ray Dalio suggest to keep ~7% in precious metals. Another inflation play would be commodities such as oil or oil companies or lumber etc….</p>\n\n<p>7 I do not suggest buying or using these. OPTIONS. You can sell calls or buy puts when expecting crashes. If I had to chose one I would sell COVERED calls and re buy them when the stock drops for a lower premium and reinvest the difference. With put options I think the risk is greater. I won’t go into detail here on what options are. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading and as always happy investing let’s meet our goals.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ogkoau/ive_seen_several_post_worries_about_a_market/","title":"I’ve seen several post worries about a market crash- mostly new investors who are worried they bought the top.
