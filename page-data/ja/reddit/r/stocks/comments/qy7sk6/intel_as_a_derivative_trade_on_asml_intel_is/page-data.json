This concept was created by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel and has actually held up for decades.</p>\n\n<p>ASML designs and manufactures EUV lithography machines, which are extremely high precision machines that put complex designs on incredibly small chips. ASML is the only EUV lithography design and manufacturer in the world. Look up their stock performance and financials if you question these claims.</p>\n\n<p>Intel used to be a top class chip manufacturer but they&#39;ve struggled with the 7nm chips and their stock has been punished. The simple reason for Intel&#39;s shortcomings is they&#39;ve not been using EUV lithography machines from ASML.</p>\n\n<p>Plain and simple, without EUV lithography, Intel has been handicapping itself for years now and is a big reason they have fallen behind. The last link below notes how their 7nm chip design is now using EUV lithography at the 2 new fab plants they are building for $20B in Arizona. Intel is going to start to catch up.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: ASML provides the technology to keep Moore&#39;s Law alive and Intel hasn&#39;t been using it until now. Their depressed, low P/E stock valuation will begin to correct with outperformance as their technology begins to catch-up after major mistakes not using EUV lithography.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/asml-extreme-ultraviolet-lithography-chips-moores-law/\">ASML Keeping Moore&#39;s Law Alive</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-services/semiconductor-advisors/302806-asml-is-the-key-to-intels-resurrection-just-like-asml-helped-tsmc-beat-intel/\">ASML is the Key to Intel&#39;s Resurrection Just like TSMC beat Intel</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html#gs.h19m75\">Intel 7nm Chip Design to Now Use EUV Lithography</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qy7sk6/intel_as_a_derivative_trade_on_asml_intel_is/","title":"Intel as a derivative trade on ASML.
