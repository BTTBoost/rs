&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I put $500 into AMC back in 2020 hoping for a 6-7x return in 1 - 2 yrs. As luck would have it, this became one of the meme stocks and it shot up to $70. Excited to be part of the movement, I hung on, joined the AMC stock forum and stayed in as it dipped back down and down. But it&amp;#39;s just gotten to a point where it doesn&amp;#39;t make responsible sense for me to keep it anymore in hopes of another price surge up to $60 and beyond, when the last few months&amp;#39; price surges only go up ~$40 and I&amp;#39;m sitting on ~14x and have real life bills to pay, including a major medical bill. So, I bit today&amp;#39;s price surge past $40 and sold, I know it was the responsible thing to do - but damn this hurts. Really wanted to be a part of the next a-p-e nation win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: so i posted here bc i figured the other forums would hate on me for selling.  I know this was the responsible thing to do, but it would&amp;#39;ve been nice to hang in there with the rest of a-p-e nation - but don&amp;#39;t have the extra $$ to be doing that right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit 2: want to add, despite my decision to sell, i think this whole memestock phenomenon is so cool and when i&amp;#39;m old with grandkids, it&amp;#39;ll be cool to look back and say that I was a part of it even for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford owns 102 million shares (it should sell them sharpish at this price) worth an incredible $17.5 billion in Rivian that has sold a couple of hundred cars to employees to date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not absurd at all. I mean Rivian had a massive 13,000 orders at end of 3Q (giggle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously wonder how many Rivian investors know that Ford has a massive stake.  I hope it sells it very soon as a Ford shareholder.  Those funds can quickly be put to use massively outselling Rivian in BEV&amp;#39;s by even larger multiples in 2022, 2023, 2024....(basically forever).&lt;/p&gt;

With shares hovering around record highs, it will take a blockbuster report to move the needle for investors. Nvidia stock rose 0.6% to $302.03 in Tuesday trading. Shares surged earlier this month as investors bought in on hype surrounding Nvidia’s financial prospects amid billions in investment, most notably from Facebook ‘s newly rebranded parent Meta Platforms (FB), to build a theorized next phase of the internet called the metaverse. Not even renewed scrutiny in the U.K. related to its proposed acquisition of chip designer Arm could stop the graphics card stock’s 131% year-to-date run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter, analysts polled by FactSet forecast adjusted earnings of $1.11 a share and sales of $6.82 billion. The earnings report or outlook may need to be a blowout for the stock to continue rising. Though 34 of the 43 analysts listed by FactSet have Buy or equivalent ratings, the stock’s mean price target is $280.70. Bullish analysts will either need to raise their targets or downgrade the stock if shares hold above their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

This rumor started because Canoo moved its headquarter to Bentonville, the home of Walmart headquarters. Canoo also teased during its earnings call that it will be building some prototypes for an unnamed partner, which of course the internet jumped on the idea that it must be Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little skeptical of this, since Walmart already has other car partners like Ford and Gatik. Does it make sense to add Canoo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thesis is that Canoo is a decent speculative stock even if it doesn&amp;#39;t have this Walmart deal. There&amp;#39;s lots of other tailwinds such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The infrastructure bill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canoo fills a niche that&amp;#39;s not directly competitive against Rivian or Tesla (and definitely not Lucid). For example Canoo would be great for local governments and schools which will be forced to go green and would like vehicles with low maintenance costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is hungry for EV stock right now. And at sub $20 this is something people can feel good throwing a few bucks in and hold for years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worried that Canoo doesn&amp;#39;t manufacture it&amp;#39;s own vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canoo already had one hyped up story with the acquisition talks with Apple. If this Walmart thing go south investors will &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hate Canoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible discussion topics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; possible reasons to move to Bentonville? Perhaps that city offer huge incentives not seen elsewhere, or maybe it&amp;#39;s actually a great hub of manufacturing. Anyone in that area know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does Canoo stack up against other EV &amp;quot;hype&amp;quot; stocks right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I bought some Canoo this morning, and I kinda like their aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something here? I used to be an avid gamer myself. But my current age I dont have the mental or physical will power to play a game when I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just tired as hell. Its been a drag for my significant other, since we were both avid gamers together.  But its just the reality.. I&amp;#39;m way too tired to play anything on the weekends. Luckily, I just spectate whatever she&amp;#39;s playing and I guess I get my gaming fix there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question remains though. I know my anecdotal experience isnt going to be very useful but I&amp;#39;m just wondering how everybody else feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the FB meta video, all +1 hour of it, and I just thought.. wow. Who would want to be logged into a video game with that shit on your face for multiple hours??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just me? Am I just an old fart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also vaguely reminds me of the 3d movies phase as well. Everybody thought we&amp;#39;d be lining up to see these 3d movies forever but people quickly got tired of that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEY POINTS&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon has told some customers that, from Jan. 19 onward, the company will no longer accept Visa credit cards issued in Britain.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The e-commerce giant cited high fees charged by the payment processor.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visa said it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; plans to stop accepting payments made via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/V&quot;&gt;Visa&lt;/a&gt; credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The e-commerce giant has told some customers that, from Jan. 19 onward, the company will no longer accept Visa credit cards issued in Britain ” due to the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa shares fell 2.5% in U.S. premarket trading.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visa earlier this year hiked the interchange fees it charges merchants for processing digital transactions between the U.K. and the European Union.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Brexit, an EU cap on interchange fees no longer applies in the U.K., allowing card networks to raise their charges.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastercard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;has also increased its U.K.-EU interchange fees.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon customers were told they will still be able to use debit cards — including those issued by Visa — and non-Visa credit cards like Mastercard and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Express&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Users are being encouraged to update their default payment method ahead of the changes.&lt;/strong&gt; The news was first reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-will-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-u-k?srnd=technology-vp&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa said it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“U.K. shoppers can use their Visa debit and credit cards at Amazon U.K. today and throughout the holiday season,” a Visa spokesperson told CNBC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a long-standing relationship with Amazon, and we continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon U.K. without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon blasted Visa for its high card charges. “The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers,” a spokesperson for the company told CNBC.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move could be viewed as a way for Amazon to get some bargaining power over Visa to lower its fees. The payments firm also charges businesses scheme fees to become part of its network.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While smaller retailers aren’t in a position to negotiate, Amazon — given its size — may have better luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking into three stocks which includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fortitudegold.com/&quot;&gt;Fortitude Gold&lt;/a&gt; (FTCO). They are a small producer but a good thing about them is that they have no debts. They recently increased their dividend by 14%, and reported positive results in their Golden Mile property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threevalleycopper.com/&quot;&gt;Three Valley Copper&lt;/a&gt; (TVC) since they’re showing great potential too. They announced a financing with a deal brought about by investor demand, financing the company with $16 million dollars. They are expected to start mining early 2022 and will potentially produce 13-16 thousand tonnes of copper cathodes in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit, TSLA is at $1T valuation and won’t stop there most likely. Yes, yes, I know Tesla is NoT jUsT aN EV cOmPaNy. But still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is, what is the hype with EV stocks? I understand that it is a rapidly growing industry since mandates and adoption will allow EVs to replace ICE vehicles in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, automaker margins are freaking terrible. I just don’t see the appeal of auto maker stocks going up just because they are going EV. There will be lots of competitors (obviously), beit the new companies like Lucid, Rivian, and Tesla and the legacy makers like Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. Also, it’s not like EV is some niche field where duopolies or monopolies will thrive either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also not mention that EVs will cost more to make when compared to ICE. So it’s not like auto makers are going to cut major costs like when Ford introduced the assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just want to start a discussion and hear people’s thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, I’m not shorting or buying puts. Just genuinely surprised that this EV bubble or rally - whatever you want to call it - is still going strong. Especially in times of inflation fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did $645M in revenue in 2020, and are projecting $1.6B in 2021. Right now, the SPAC is valued at just $1.55B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also backed by Volvo, Geely, and Leonardo DiCaprio? IMO most undervalued EV company after GM and F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you all probably know by now the popular social media company formerly known as Facebook has changed its name to Meta. This has sparked discussions about the Metaverse and its future effect on society, and rightfully so. Although I have seen many posts online and especially on Reddit which don’t quite seem to grasp what the Metaverse is and why it&amp;#39;s the future, please note if you are one of these people don’t worry - it’s complicated for sure! This post will explain simply what the Metaverse is and why you should get on board now. I will do my best to explain but if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments and I will be sure to reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse put simply is the combination of multiple elements of technology, but put more complexly is where virtual reality, blockchain and web3 meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way of explaining web3 is to first understand web1 and web2. Web1 is what many may consider the first stage of the internet, if you look at what the first iterations of the internet were, it was just code on a screen. It was complex to use and only really used for sharing scientific work. Web2 is what we now know as the internet. This includes Youtube, Reddit etc. The main downside of web2 is for the longest time other than a domain name you couldn’t own anything online. You could make a video and post it on Youtube, even though you feel you own the video and control it, Youtube at any point can remove the video and even your channel. At any point in time everything online can be controlled by someone else. This is where web3 comes in. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet. Web3 may as well be called the decentralised internet. It allows users to freely use the internet run on blockchain, so anyone can participate without having your personal data involved or monetized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big reason crypto based items such as coins and NFT’s have taken off as they are based on web3 technology. For the first time normal everyday people are able to own their own little part of the internet, and no one, including the government, can tell you what to do. It&amp;#39;s the next step for total freedom online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse isn’t a place, the Metaverse isn’t something you can touch. A big mistake I see is people think that there is going to be some sort of invention or overnight change where suddenly the Metaverse is mainstream and that&amp;#39;s our lives, no. It will be a gradual change which has already started and will continue to the point that our virtual life is worth more to us than our physical lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the Metaverse the next big thing?:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best place to start on why the Metaverse will be the next big thing will be to look back at previous technology. 99% of human attention used to be on our physical environment. TV’s dropped that to 85%. Computers dropped that to 70%. Phones dropped that to 50%. It&amp;#39;s clear that as technology advances it absorbs more and more of our time and energy. At some point something new will drop that to lower and lower numbers to the point where we are using technology 100% of the time, this may take decades but it&amp;#39;s entirely possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be something mind-blowing but just imagine some type of augmented reality device which either connects to your brain or you see it through contact lenses, imagine it just helped with basic everyday things like arrows on a road so you don&amp;#39;t have to distract yourself with a GPS, or walking into a McDonalds and being able to see the calories of each food item on the menu. These are just basic examples of what the first iteration of augmented reality can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse will be the next big thing because &lt;strong&gt;it will be everything.&lt;/strong&gt; Anything you could imagine will be in the Metaverse. It can range from anything from gaming to concerts to seeing family members from the other side of the world. There is no beginning, middle and end, it&amp;#39;s just infinite code waiting to be filled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life application and potential benefits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the potential benefits I want to start with isn’t about what will be good inside the Metaverse but outside it. A comment I’m seeing a lot online is people saying “I want to work on fixing the real world, not create a fake one”. But I think people are missing the point that this will make the real world better. Imagine the millions of cars we can get off the road and reduce pollution if people no longer had to drive to work and school, and instead would stay at home and work in the Metaverse. Of course this may vary depending on the industry but even if we could get 50% of cars off the road it would be a massive achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this more and more benefits keep popping in my head, I will just briefly write some ideas but it&amp;#39;s really going to be endless. Surgeons can practice their work virtually. Architects can design and walk around buildings before construction. Home buyers can visit a home from their own home. People on lower incomes can travel the world from their living room. Schools can visit any museum. Entrepreneurs and businesses can save money on office space. Lovers of history can travel to any time desired (DINOSAURS!). The list really is endless, so I will stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential negatives and why it won’t matter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any new technology there are always downsides. When the microwave first came out people were terrified of it, same with TV, radio, social media and now the Metaverse. I will note that is a good thing. As a society we should always look to protect ourselves and do what&amp;#39;s best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse won’t be perfect. Even nowadays cyber bullying is a major issue and it may not be any better in the Metaverse. We will distance ourselves further from the real world. Spending less and less physical time with our friends and family and more virtual time with them. The thing is though, the negatives don’t matter. Whether it&amp;#39;s good or bad technology has always advanced on and those who don’t get on board are left behind. Many said at the birth of the internet that it would be bad but it is undoubtedly the best thing to happen to humanity in the past century, and this will have the same effect. I greatly encourage those to at least have an open mind when it comes to the Metaverse, we are on the dawn of something great and those who capitalise on it will be rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long until the Metaverse is ready and becomes mainstream?:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very hard question. Actually, I think this is an impossible question. You could try and rephrase it to ‘How long until the internet is ready and becomes mainstream?’ At no point does anyone announce the internet is ready and at no point is it officially called mainstream. At some point it just became what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Metaverse creation will be gradual, it will most likely take a decade minimum but my guess is as good as yours. I think the point at which we accept as a society that the Metaverse is ready is when our digital selves are worth more than our physical selves. You even start to see it now. Kids care more about how they look on Fortnite than in real life. Teens care more about how many followers they have on Instagram than in real life. The world has and always will be  changing with technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to buy and how to make profit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could list any number of companies which could make you great gains in the near future, including FB, MSFT, U, RBLX, AMZN, ADSK etc. and I would be completely wrong! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I and many others may know a lot about the Metaverse, the truth is we won’t be able to predict even 1% of what the final product will be. If you asked a million people before the internet what the most popular websites would be you wouldn’t get a single right answer. No one knows so anyone telling you what to buy don’t actually have a clue. Yes you can make money in the short term but that’s it. Remember the dot com bubble? Watch out for a Metaverse bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts are to tell people now to worry. This isn’t some doomsday device, it’s better to just see it as an extension of your phone. The truth is we are years off of anything serious and no one is going to be forced to use it. I also don’t see any chance of it being stopped by the government as I see some people online say. Sugar and cigarettes are bad but they are legal too. I would recommend anyone to at least try and allocate a small percentage of their portfolio to one of the bigger stock names linked to the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

I think due to QE and Fed bolstering there is so much cash sloshing around looking for a home that anything with an even remote prospect of return is instantly invested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear me out. I really think this is a new paradigm, not as in oh market goes up forever and this time is different, and more as in this amount of QE and stimulus mixed with bare bones low interest rate has never been achieved before. We have never had a market with the combination of those 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s how I see things going forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dumb money is here to stay. There&amp;#39;s just too damn much of it flooding the market looking for a home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail investor sentiment has changed. No one is risk-adverse on a broad scale anymore. Investors are willing to hold through dips and plunge more cash into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest rates are rock bottom, and there&amp;#39;s the possibility they stay that way or go negative due to debt implications if they&amp;#39;re raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s going to change? Is retail suddenly going to become risk adverse? Is the amount of capital flooding the system going to be reigned in? Are interest rates going to drastically rise, if at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think so. I quite literally think that given market conditions and sentiment a correction is not even possible. Do all the remind me&amp;#39;s you want. The market is unable to correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE SUPER CHARGER NETWORK. This is basically a system of electric gas stations that charge your car in 30-40 minutes, and allows you to drive ANYWHERE in America and Canada. You can drive from San Diego to NYC with this network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what you can&amp;#39;t do with a Rivian or Lucid? Drive anywhere you don&amp;#39;t normally drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to charge your car at a charge port or whatever, it&amp;#39;ll take you 8 hours for a full charge. The only reason Tesla is worth anything is because of their phenomenal super charger network. How the fuck are lucid and rivian going to compete with that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit: looks like the truth has triggered some fuckin’ noobs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned congressional leadership Tuesday that the federal government could default on its debt next month if they don’t take action to raise the debt ceiling.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a letter to top lawmakers, Ms. Yellen projected that after Dec. 15, there are scenarios in which the Treasury could have “insufficient resources to continue to finance the operation of the U.S. government.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Yellen added that she has “a high degree of confidence” in the Treasury’s ability to make debt payments through Dec. 15. That’s two weeks longer than her initial forecast of Dec. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More money coming in? More pump?&lt;/p&gt;
