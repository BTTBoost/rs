I could be off base, correct me if so. I am working off of <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns\">this</a>, which doesn&#39;t factor in dividend reinvestment, and <a href=\"https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns\">this</a>, which does.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The mean return of the S&amp;P from 1928 to 2020 is 7.78% without DRIP, and 11.89% with DRIP.</p>\n\n<p>However, factored into the mean are:</p>\n\n<p>2008 housing crisis crash (-38.49%/-37%)</p>\n\n<p>2002 dotcom/September 11th crash (-23.37%/-22.1%)</p>\n\n<p>2000 dotcom crash (-10.14%/-9.1% in 2000 and -13.04%/-11.89% in 2001)</p>\n\n<p>1973 fuel crisis crash (-17.37%/-14.66% in 1973 and -29.72%/-26.47% in 1974)</p>\n\n<p>1946-1948 postwar bear market (-11.87%/-8.07%, 0%/+5.71%, and -.64%/+5.5%, respectively)</p>\n\n<p>1939-1941 early war bear market (-5.45%/-0.41%, -15.29%/--9.78%, -17.86%/-11.59% respectively)</p>\n\n<p>1937 recession (-38.59%/-35.03%)</p>\n\n<p>1929-1932 Great Crash (-11.91%/-8.42%, -28.48%/-24.9%, -47.07%/-43.34%, -15.15%/-8.19% respectively).</p>\n\n<p>As well as the 14 other years in which there was a bear market, correction, or returns were slightly negative or flat, for a total of 31 years of negative-or-no returns over the last 93 (i.e. 1 in 3).</p>\n\n<p>This means there needs to exist sufficiently high returns in order to offset these numbers and still arrive at the 7.78%/11.89% mean.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>When looking at averages, it&#39;s often better to look at the median - the middlemost number in a set - as it isn&#39;t getting skewed by outliers.</p>\n\n<p>With every negative year in consideration, the median return comes out to 10.79% without DRIP and 14.31% with.</p>\n\n<p>However, if we only look at years with positive return, the median is 16.87% without drip and 20.05% with.</p>\n\n<p>This means, since the median is the number in the middle, that half of all years have returns higher than these medians.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at the year that follows each crash:</p>\n\n<p>1933: 46.59%/53.99%</p>\n\n<p>1938: 25.21%/31.12%</p>\n\n<p>1975: 31.55%/37.2%</p>\n\n<p>1989: 27.25%/31.69%</p>\n\n<p>2003: 26.38%/28.68%</p>\n\n<p>2009: 23.45%/26.46%</p>\n\n<p>Every single year after a year in which there was a crash has had a return substantially greater than the median <em>positive</em> return.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>At the beginning of this year, the S&amp;P 500 was at 3700.65. Yesterday, August 19 2021, it was 4405.8, a 19.055% YTD return before DRIP.</p>\n\n<p>This means, SPX has returned approximately 2.12%, non-compounded, per month. If it were to continue at exactly the same rate, it would close the year with a return of 25.41% before DRIP.</p>\n\n<p>If this were to be the case, it would be the 20th highest pre-DRIP return over the last 93 years - barely in the top twenty percent - and still lower than all but one other post-crash year (that year itself being the start of the current bull run).</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Last year&#39;s returns, from January 1 to December 31, were 16.26%/18.4%. While there was vigorous recovery from the covid crash - from a low of 2304.92 to 3756.07 EOY, an increase of nearly 63% - it is worth noting that other crashes have been precipitated by some sort of major economic crisis; energy, housing, etc. The most comparable crash to last year&#39;s, to my mind, is Black Monday 1987, which is <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/what-caused-black-monday-stock-market-crash-1987.asp#:%7E:text=The%20%22Black%20Monday%22%20stock%20market,as%20well%20as%20investor%20panic.\">believed to have been caused at least in part by a computer error</a>, and also recovered relatively quickly.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The bull run we&#39;ve been in since 2009 is not even the longest in history. From 1982 to 1999, or even 1994 if we want to avoid anything that could be reasonably described as part of the dotcom bubble, only two years - 1990 and 1994 - were negative or flat, at -6.56%/-3.1% and -1.54%/+1.32% respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Compare to the current bull run, in which three years have been negative or flat: 2011 at 0.00%/+2.11%, 2015 at -0.73%/+1.38%, and 2018 at -6.24%/-4.38%.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s compare mean returns:</p>\n\n<p>1982-1994: 11.21%/15.44%</p>\n\n<p>1982-1999: 15.41%/19.12%</p>\n\n<p>2009-2020: 13.15%/15.53%</p>\n\n<p>And median returns:</p>\n\n<p>1982-1994: 12.40%/16.61%</p>\n\n<p>1982-1999: 16.02%/21.295%</p>\n\n<p>2009-2020: 13.10%/15.53%</p>\n\n<p>An overall comparable performance in which the respective positive median isn&#39;t even always outperformed.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Of the top 10 years of S&amp;P returns, only one year in the current bull run- 2013 - is in the top ten, and only three other years - 1975, 1995, and 1997 - have occurred in the last 60 years, the next most recent being 1958.</p>\n\n<p>The top 5 returns by year are:</p>\n\n<p>1933:   46.59%/53.99%</p>\n\n<p>1954:   45.02%/52.62%</p>\n\n<p>1935:   41.37%/47.67%</p>\n\n<p>1928:       37.88%/43.61%</p>\n\n<p>1958:   38.06%/43.36%</p>\n\n<p>Even the lowest of which is substantially higher than the highest years (2013 and 2019) in the last 10.</p>\n\n<p>While average p/e is perhaps higher than in periods before, this is probably reflective of a shift from value into growth due to the rapid rate at which technology is improving.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>We live in relatively unprecedented times: technology has never advanced so quickly, people have never lived so long, the world population has never been so high, economies have never been so globalized, and emerging markets are becoming more developed. <strong>It makes sense that we&#39;re in a period of robust expansion.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This is not to say this bull run can&#39;t or won&#39;t ever end, or that there won&#39;t even be hiccups, but good years aren&#39;t a bad thing, they aren&#39;t necessarily a portent of bad times to come, and the last couple of years haven&#39;t even been <em>extraordinarily</em> good (thus far), at least if we&#39;re working based off of historical returns.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p85y6w/some_notes_on_sp_historical_returns/","title":"Some notes on S&P historical
