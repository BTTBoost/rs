Sofi has features such as <strong>Checking Accounts, Credit Cards, Stock Investing,  Student Loan Refinancing and Origination, Personal Loans, Mortgage Refinancing, Auto Loan Refinancing</strong> <strong>and Early Payday, so you can blow your Wendy’s paycheck 2 days earlier.</strong> The vast array of products they offer and partnerships they have formed with other companies gives them a unique ability to cross-sell their products to customers and retain customers by doing so. For example, someone may come to SOFI refinance their gender studies student loans, but end up banking and investing with them. This is because of a singular key factor. <strong>Convenience.</strong> Sofi’s target audience for their products are millennials who are financially savvy. What do we know about millennials? They value convenience. It’s why people will use Grubhub, Doordash or Uber-Eats despite the absurd fees and cold tendies they receive; why people will use Amazon Prime to order stuff rather than go in person; why people will use Robinhood despite it going down every time something interesting actually happens in the market. This creates a dynamic where people will switch over their entire financial life to Sofi in order to simplify things, and makes Sofi in many ways, a superapp in the making, similar to that of Alipay.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pnyzn6ihf7871.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c24282bb20dd3571b020b51616a3ecf5b4c23eea\"> Sofi has worked out deals with big banks so that retail can get an equal footing in IPO’s. Provided a Sofi member has $3,000 in their Sofi Invest account, they are eligible to get in on an IPO at the IPO’s reference price, as opposed to market price.  </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Financials?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When we hear the term lending, we probably think of some Big Short Michael Burry subprime fuckery, but that is not what we have here today. Sofi deals with high quality customers with good income and good credit scores, rather than degenerates like you. Because of this, they can run a business model that is beneficial to all parties involved. Sofi can charge lower interest rates due to the low risk of default on any lending they do, and customers can get low interest rates with flexible payment options. This provides a good experience for customers and helps Sofi retain them, or better yet, cross-sell them on other products. As it stands now, Sofi’s bread and butter is Business to Consumer (B2C) lending, which makes up a large portion of their revenue, however as time goes on and we see an expansion and more adoption of their financial services (Banking, Credit Cards, Investing), we will see this shift to be more diversified. Sofi projects 43% CAGR, which is far above other companies in the sector, such as PayPal and Square, who project 20.2% and 29.3% respectively. Sofi will be profitable this year as well, and by 2025 will be raking in Billions of dollars in annual profits. Overall, Sofi is in a very healthy position with a boatload of cash on hand ready to expand the business, be it through acquisitions, or building out products.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0qwveoorf7871.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27edc4a721d49544074324e920856b7d8f2f7536\">https://preview.redd.it/0qwveoorf7871.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27edc4a721d49544074324e920856b7d8f2f7536</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nxsb5cxsf7871.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7953fca5f265f025feb036fbf02e6d8183550b90\"> Graph go brrrr</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Moat?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sofi is a very unique business. Due to it’s jack of all trades nature, it is hard to pinpoint a singular company which compares to it. It shares aspects with dozens of companies, such as investing with Robinhood/Webull/Chime/Acorns, banking with legacy banks such as GS/JPM/BAC/WFC, and many other companies who parallel Sofi. With this said, Sofi has a <strong><em>massive</em></strong> advantage over other fintech platforms. <strong>Galileo</strong>. No, not the astronomer. <strong>Galileo</strong> is to Sofi what AWS is to Amazon. <strong>Galileo</strong> is a fintech API which powers many of the fintech companies we know and love (or hate) today. Companies such as Robinhood rely on <strong>Galileo</strong> to power aspects of their business, such as issuing debit cards and opening accounts. What this means for all you smoothbrains out there, is that as those companies grow and gain members, Sofi gets a cut of that. Though Robinhood is the most well known of the companies handled by <strong>Galileo</strong>, there are dozens of others who all rely on it to power their businesses.</p>\n\n<p>![img](ass2c6hxf7871 &quot;\n&quot;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Action?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fy6qenk0g7871.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd43b211a2f8a431bb6ac5194bbab4d14bd26989\">Crayon Says Stock Go Uppies 🚀</a></p>\n\n<p>Because some of you smooth brained degenerates might not know how to draw with crayons, I will do it for you. Sofi has been in an overall uptrend since it’s merger deal was announced earlier this year. In February, Sofi peaked at an ATH of 28.2 dollars, right before the Inflation Boogaloo made the markets throw a fit. From then it’s had some choppy price action but has continued in it’s uptrend. Recently, Sofi has dropped due to Pipe unlocking, allowing them to sell.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pipe?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, not the lead thing you licked as a kid, putting your room-temp IQ ass on the path to WSB. PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) is when big investment firms are offered the ability to invest before a merger is announced at a favorable price. In doing this, their shares are locked up for a period of time so that they don’t immediately sell. As of last Friday, PIPE investors were able to sell their shares if they wanted. On Friday and Monday, we saw high volume price action with lots of volatility. Friday was somewhat brutal for holders, but Monday not only presented opportunities for dip buying, but had a great close. Sofi rejected the lows of 17.6 and closed at 19.4, significantly above the $18 support level. TLDR? <strong>Stock Goes Uppies Tomorrow.</strong> 🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>![img](w8625038g7871 &quot;\nSofi Pipe consists of ⅔ investors who likely have no plans on selling, and ⅓ funds who would likely sell. With over 94 million volume the past 2 trading days, it is very likely they have all sold, setting us up to 🚀&quot;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Squeeze?</strong>   </p>\n\n<p>Sofi currently has over <strong>28 million</strong> shares short sold, with borrow fees costing hundreds of % in fees. Admittedly, some of this is due to PIPE holders hedging their positions (Long PIPE shares, Short shares on the open market), but there is almost certainly some non pipe related shorts. There are almost no shares available to short at any given time however, and retail are getting paid <strong>46% interest</strong> just for diamond handing shares and lending them. Pretty sweet right? With the bullish price action today and high short interest, this could be a powder keg ready to be set off with rocket fuel 🚀.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u9mngtpcg7871.png?width=1331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c82f361102f7fb7e0064e546bcb5ed6fa081a2e\">Screenshot from IborrowDesk shows high borrow rates with few shares available to borrow.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Catalysts?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Sofi is currently in the process of becoming a chartered bank. What this means is that they have to get government approval and become an FDIC approved entity, so if they blow up like Bear Stearns, your $50.33 checking account is protected. Sofi recently purchased a bank with an existing charter so that instead of getting a brand new charter, they can simply request a transfer of control. This will speed up the process, and although the bank charter will probably be approved later this year, any positive news earlier could set this stock off. Sofi will also release earnings most likely in July, and it is seemingly likely they will smash estimates which make stock go 🚀.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q462ix4jg7871.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ecd9e78250c04f32e46bb58d66629ec207a887\">https://preview.redd.it/q462ix4jg7871.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ecd9e78250c04f32e46bb58d66629ec207a887</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sofi Stadium and Noto.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The CEO of Sofi is simply put, a baller. Anthony Noto was a football superstar in college, an Army Ranger, and has worked in high level positions for Goldman Sachs, The NFL and Twitter before joining Sofi. Every company needs to advertise, and how did Noto choose to do this? He named a fucking stadium. That&#39;s right, when your boomer dad is watching football, it could be at Sofi Stadium. Sofi stadium is situated in LA, and is home to the LA Rams and Chargers. It also facilitates lots of other venues.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/sxandv9og7871.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7841e2e3aedd3de8fcb03afb74a4f14a68fc072\">Noto Second From The Right</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a4nllkdqg7871.png?width=1999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c117aef6b8705229e9ce77ebf14999e3cbd65c2\">https://preview.redd.it/a4nllkdqg7871.png?width=1999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c117aef6b8705229e9ce77ebf14999e3cbd65c2</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Options Flow?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3u12luzrg7871.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93731f5e541ab0a13989e84c044afafe9beebbaa\">Lots of bullish inflow.</a></p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Sofi had a massive amount of short term call options bought with strikes between $10-$20. You know what this means? Gamma Squeeze.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions? Ban?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Ticker, Strike, Expiration. I get it. Your adhd riddled brains can’t focus on something for more than 5 seconds, so I gotchu. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zxpf27uug7871.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97f20daf9b30ab9f4beb030aa2d770ca79f99c59\"> I&#39;m long 46 SOFI 2023 10C, but if you have more risk tolerance than me (who am I kidding, you do), July calls are a good buy. If water is too spicy for you and options aren’t your thing however, just buy shares. No-one here will judge you for being as bland as white rice.  </a></p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Good company, bullish crayons, short and gamma squeeze, stock go 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oa86eq/sofi_so_fly/","title":"SOFI -
