I personally believe they have a very bright future. My current largest position is into $OUST. Lidar stocks haven’t had the best run over the last couple of months in the market, but I truly believe the tech will be essential in the future as EV’s and AV’s become more widely adopted. $OUST is building an extremely promising and dedicated team with the recent acquisition of Sense Photonics. They just added the CEO of Mercedes-Benz Trucks, Karin Rådström, to their board of directors, and they’re currently the only publicly traded company offering digital lidar instead of analog lidar like their competitors. Digital lidar has many more applications than just auto as well and will allow for lower manufacturing costs, more scalability, and more widespread use of the tech in my opinion. Does anyone else have an opinion on the future of lidar stocks? I personally believe $OUST will be a top dog in the lidar space, but I’m curious to know y’alls thoughts on other publicly traded lidar companies (Ex. $AEVA, $LAZR, $LIDR, $VLDR, $MVIS, and $INVS)</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Definitely plan on continuing to hold $OUST for at least another couple of years. They already have almost 600 established customers, their digital lidar is best in class, and they focus far more on the industrial uses of lidar than the automotive uses. If they come anywhere close to their projected sales by 2025, this stock will see pretty large gains.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qe5hyr/thoughts_on_the_future_of_lidar_technology_stocks/","title":"Thoughts on the future of Lidar Technology Stocks?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-23T19:49:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-23 19:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qe5hyr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qe5hyr/thoughts_on_the_future_of_lidar_technology_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qe5hyr/thoughts_on_the_future_of_lidar_technology_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ClickForNothing","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ClickForNothing","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ClickForNothing","score":82,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ライダーテクノロジー関連銘柄の今後についてお聞かせください。","the_new_excerpt":"ライダ技術銘柄全体の将来性について、この企業がどのように考えているのか知りたい。\n全体としての 個人的には非常に明るい未来が待っていると信じています。私の現在の\n最大のポジションは$OUSTです。ライダー関連銘柄は、ここ数ヶ月の市場ではあまり良い成績を残せていません。\nしかし、私はこの技術を信じています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对激光雷达技术股票的未来有什么看法？","the_new_excerpt":"很想知道这名子弟对激光雷达技术股票的未来有什么想法\n作为一个整体。我个人认为它们有一个非常光明的未来。我目前的\n最大的仓位是OUST美元。在过去的几个月里，激光雷达股票在市场上的表现并不是最好的。\n在过去几个月的市场中，激光雷达股票的表现并不理想，但我真的相信这项技术...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對激光雷達技術股票的未來有什麼看法？","the_new_excerpt":"很想知道這名子弟對激光雷達技術股票的未來有什麼想法\n作爲一個整體。我個人認爲它們有一個非常光明的未來。我目前的\n最大的倉位是OUST美元。在過去的幾個月裏，激光雷達股票在市場上的表現並不是最好的。\n在過去幾個月的市場中，激光雷達股票的表現並不理想，但我真的相信這項技術...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qe8upj","excerpt":"Yesterday I was reading this article:\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/ea04e3c1-4105-4411-b0ac-33449d1f3511\n\nThis part is what struck me most:\n\n\"Vanguard last week updated its forecast of expected 60/40 returns for the\ncoming decade and their capital markets model has a median annualised gain of\n3.8 per…","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qe8upj/are_we_still_achieving_our_goal/","title":"Are we still achieving our goal?","date":"October 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今でも目標を達成できているのか？","the_new_excerpt":"昨日、私はこの記事を読んでいました。\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/ea04e3c1-4105-4411-b0ac-33449d1f3511\n\nこの部分が一番印象に残りました。\n\n「Vanguard社は先週、今後10年間の60/40リターンの予想を更新した。\nバンガードは先週、今後10年間の60/40のリターン予測を更新し、資本市場モデルでは中央値で年率3.8%の利益とした。\n3.8%...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们还在实现我们的目标吗？","the_new_excerpt":"昨天我在读这篇文章。\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/ea04e3c1-4105-4411-b0ac-33449d1f3511\n\n这一部分是我印象最深的地方。\n\n\"Vanguard上周更新了其对未来十年60/40收益率的预测。\n他们的资本市场模型的年化收益中值为\n3.8％。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們還在實現我們的目標嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"昨天我在讀這篇文章。\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/ea04e3c1-4105-4411-b0ac-33449d1f3511\n\n這一部分是我印象最深的地方。\n\n\"Vanguard上週更新了其對未來十年60/40收益率的預測。\n他們的資本市場模型的年化收益中值爲\n3.8％。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qec10r","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qec10r/yes/","title":"Yes","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 23, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"はい。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"是","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"是","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qe5hyr","previousId":"RedditPost-qe8upj","nextId":"RedditPost-qec10r","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qe5hyr/thoughts_on_the_future_of_lidar_technology_stocks/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
