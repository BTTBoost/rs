The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think?</strong> Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good to know</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage ~ 1:9)</em></li>\n<li><em>In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends.</em></li>\n<li><em>Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large.</em></li>\n<li><em>I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD.</em></li>\n<li><em>Some Swedish stocks are traded with an &quot;A&quot; and a &quot;B&quot; stock. Always choose the latter. &quot;A&quot; stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in &quot;B&quot;-stocks.</em></li>\n<li><em>When I type</em> <strong><em>&#39;SG&#39;</em></strong><em>, this refers to the &quot;Swedish Government&quot;, and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects.</em></li>\n<li><em>TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Heavy Industry</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>SSAB B.</strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it&#39;s green steel project called &quot;Hybrit&quot; which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that &quot;Hybrit&quot; will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands.</li>\n<li>When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the &quot;good to know&quot; section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it&#39;s employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock.</li>\n<li>SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it&#39;s best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it&#39;s markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it&#39;s shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in.</li>\n<li>The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>VOLVO B (VOLV B)</strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it&#39;s own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It&#39;s not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon).</li>\n<li>Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks <strong>IN THE WORLD</strong>, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB.</li>\n<li>Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts.</li>\n<li>Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it&#39;s full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I.</li>\n<li>The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2.</li>\n<li>Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world.</li>\n<li>Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it&#39;s 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a &quot;shy&quot; 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Military Industry</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>SAAB AB (SAAB B)</strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SAAB, also known for it&#39;s no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call &quot;ethical markets&quot;. Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a &quot;defensive&quot; military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of &quot;defensive&quot;?</li>\n<li>If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let&#39;s just say I am excited for the future.</li>\n<li>Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB.<br/>\n\n<ul>\n<li>JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it&#39;s ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish &quot;zone of influence&quot;. Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG.</li>\n<li>Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a &quot;one-shot&quot; Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces.</li>\n<li>A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it&#39;s effectiveness and this not being a &quot;Defensive plattform&quot;. Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for <strong>two years</strong> and sink it&#39;s largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game.</li>\n<li>Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS.</li>\n<li>Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it&#39;s largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a &quot;bonus&quot; when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen.</li>\n<li>Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB.</li>\n<li>The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>High-tech Industry</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Azelio (AZELIO)</strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Now this is more of an &quot;up-comer&quot; and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make.</li>\n<li>Active in &quot;green-tech&quot;, Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks.</li>\n<li>The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure.</li>\n<li>The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks.</li>\n<li>In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand.</li>\n<li>Having purchased Volvo&#39;s old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories.</li>\n<li>To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called &quot;Todays Industry&quot; questioned the CEOs usage of &quot;production goals&quot; and &quot;production target&quot; which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3.</li>\n<li>The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely.</li>\n<li>CEO interview can be found by searching <em>&quot;Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference&quot;</em> on the tube.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>AegirBio (AEGIR)</strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I won&#39;t go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one.</li>\n<li>Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event.</li>\n<li>The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn&#39;t been dilluted and there hasn&#39;t (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally &quot;just&quot; 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and ~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends.</li>\n<li>The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval in august, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who&#39;s guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders.</li>\n<li>The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It&#39;s a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Gaming Industry</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Media and Games Invest (M8G)</strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Have you ever played a video game? Well then it&#39;s quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish &quot;Counterstrike&quot; success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games.</li>\n<li>M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next &quot;success&quot; they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it&#39;s become the &quot;stock of the year&quot;. However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it&#39;s ATH in mid-july.</li>\n<li>This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news.</li>\n<li>In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven&#39;t been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you will find some of it to your liking.
