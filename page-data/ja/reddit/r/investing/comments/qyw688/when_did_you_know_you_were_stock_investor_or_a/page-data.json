It&#39;s seems like you need to study alot of quasi science, be on social media constantly, do alot of cocaine, and it really just seems stressful. </p>\n\n<p>The neat thing about reddit is I can look and see when people post their &quot;analysis&quot; of a stock. Which for 99% of reddit, is just a trader saying voodoo witch craft nonsense about enter and exit points, resistance this and that, cutting losses, and special orders. </p>\n\n<p>Then you ask for their portfolio and they have none or its top secret or something. It&#39;s not illegal to share your portfolio you great traders. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m an average Joe, and I&#39;m not that smart. so I feel really good when I read posts from people who buy a stock like MU, three years ago, at 40-43 a share, and sell it saying they see no future in it. It&#39;s trading at like $83 now. </p>\n\n<p>I love it when I read people saying they bought Uber near ipo at 40 and sold at 32 and say it&#39;s doomed to fail. But Uber is still around, in fact it hit a height of $60 last spring and now it&#39;s $44. You haven&#39;t even given it a chance to grow or become something yet. Like the company is a verb, give it a few years. </p>\n\n<p>I think traders are like fake friends in high school. They&#39;re only around you if you&#39;re cool. Once you&#39;re not cool anymore they abandon you. But traders are onlu a small portion of money for a company a company makes stuff to sell to people and that&#39;s what really draws in revenue to grow. </p>\n\n<p>I see alot of people talk about the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; or &quot;oppurtuniy lost, &quot; something like that when you&#39;re not trading. Like if I buy something that isn&#39;t moving fast, or something is in the red, it&#39;s better to &quot;cut my losses.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s like... Buying high and selling low. </p>\n\n<p>That sounds like the exact opposite of what you&#39;re supposed to do.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I&#39;d rather sink with my ship if you&#39;re telling me to always sell the moment my stock goes red. </p>\n\n<p>if I was so foolish as to pick a bad company, I&#39;d rather just take the full loss, rather then death by a thousand cuts. </p>\n\n<p>But I pick companies that make more revenue every year, have increasing dividends, and are medium to large size growth companies. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m boring. </p>\n\n<p>I just look at the best performing companies, read their 10k and just invest. My first two companies I bought were Apple and Starbucks, I then bought Nvidia and Realty Income. I bought Pennymac and Weyerhaeuser afterward. I just sorta sit on them. I just hold them and buy more. If I somehow become broke instantly from these decisions then damn. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m investing in known companies with easy business models. I like safety and simplicity. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe I&#39;m gonna become a multi millionaire with several cars and boats. I just want to make enough money to be the first millionaire in my family, and have my children live of my dividends so they don&#39;t have to work so hard. </p>\n\n<p>It just seems like people don&#39;t have patience on the internet. And when you take the time to read people who argue about a particular stock, and then for those same people to be proven wrong by time. It feels good.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qyw688/when_did_you_know_you_were_stock_investor_or_a/","title":"When did you know you were stock investor or a stock trader?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-21T21:44:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-21 21:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qyw688","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qyw688/when_did_you_know_you_were_stock_investor_or_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qyw688/when_did_you_know_you_were_stock_investor_or_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Foamy-Bot","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Foamy-Bot","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Foamy-Bot","score":74,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"自分が株式投資家や株式トレーダーだと知ったのはいつですか？","the_new_excerpt":"現在興味を持っている様々な企業について、ネット上のランダムな書き込みを読んでいて\n自分が投資家であることに満足していることに気づきました。\nこれからもそうでしょう。\n\nトレーダーとしての考え方を持っている人が存在することが理解できません。それは、まるで\n勉強しないといけないような気がします。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你什么时候知道自己是股票投资者或股票交易员？","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在网上阅读一堆关于我目前感兴趣的不同公司的随机帖子。\n我意识到，我很高兴我是一个投资者，而且我永远都是。\n永远都是。\n\n我不明白人们怎么能以交易员的心态存在。这似乎是\n你需要学习大量的准科学，在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你什麼時候知道自己是股票投資者或股票交易員？","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在網上閱讀一堆關於我目前感興趣的不同公司的隨機帖子。\n我意識到，我很高興我是一個投資者，而且我永遠都是。\n永遠都是。\n\n我不明白人們怎麼能以交易員的心態存在。這似乎是\n你需要學習大量的準科學，在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qyy6h0","excerpt":"I know they essentially can do the same things, but I like the whole ethos of\nVanguard and have often wondered if I should switch.
