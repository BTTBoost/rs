It reads &quot; A &quot;short squeeze&quot; due to a sudden increase in demand for our class A common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A common stock. Investors may purchase shares of our Class A common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A common stock may involve long and short exposure. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A common Stock available for our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A common Stock for deliver to lenders of our Class\nA common Stock. Those repurchases, may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A common stock until additional shares of our Class A common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a &quot;short squeeze.&quot; A large proportion of our class a Common Stock ha been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A common stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqroi/gme_10k_filing_mentions_squeeze/","title":"GME 10~k filing mentions squeeze!","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-24T02:02:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-24 02:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e6598c3b-d9ed-581a-b404-ed82a4cf9149","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqroi/gme_10k_filing_mentions_squeeze/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqroi/gme_10k_filing_mentions_squeeze/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Mitchy45","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mitchy45","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Mitchy45","score":7342,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"金交所10~k申报中提到挤压!","the_new_excerpt":"编辑 Holy fuck this is real LOL - https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ———————————\n\nGME10K中提到 \"可能会出现短线震荡\"! 他们知道接下来会发生什么!\n\n哇，有人看到了吗？对未来的预测。这是在提交的10K中!\n有什么想法和意见吗？\n\n这是在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"金交所10~k申報中提到擠壓!","the_new_excerpt":"編輯 Holy fuck this is real LOL - https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ———————————\n\nGME10K中提到 \"可能會出現短線震盪\"! 他們知道接下來會發生什麼!\n\n哇，有人看到了嗎？對未來的預測。這是在提交的10K中!\n有什麼想法和意見嗎？\n\n這是在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e0ab5554-238f-5fd3-915e-42deac3d1728","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbq4pe/gme_q4_earnings_analysis_by_an_autist/","title":"GME Q4 Earnings Analysis by an Autist.","date":"March 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME第四季度财报分析，一个自闭症患者。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME第四季度財報分析，一個自閉症患者。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-037b3f66-cc08-5c75-91fc-62492eb7aa9b","excerpt":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/04/business/financial-markets/bonds-stock-japanese-economy-global-economy-u-s-treasuries/\n[March 4]\n\n> Japanese funds sold a record $34 billion of foreign bonds in the two weeks\n> ended Feb. 26 as the nation’s fiscal year-end [on 31] March approaches —\n>…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mbu9i0/it_appears_the_recent_move_in_the_us_10year/","title":"It appears the recent move in the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.2% to 1.7% had very little to do with inflation expectations.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 24, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"最近美国10年期国债收益率从1.2%升至1.7%，似乎与通胀预期关系不大。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/04/business/financial-markets/bonds-stock-japanese-economy-global-economy-u-s-treasuries/\n[3月4日]\n\n> 日本基金两周内卖出创纪录的340亿美元外国债券\n>2月26日结束，全国财政年末[31日]3月即将到来------。\n>…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"最近美國10年期國債收益率從1.2%升至1.7%，似乎與通脹預期關係不大。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/04/business/financial-markets/bonds-stock-japanese-economy-global-economy-u-s-treasuries/\n[3月4日]\n\n> 日本基金兩週內賣出創紀錄的340億美元外國債券\n>2月26日結束，全國財政年末[31日]3月即將到來------。\n>…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-e6598c3b-d9ed-581a-b404-ed82a4cf9149","previousId":"RedditPost-e0ab5554-238f-5fd3-915e-42deac3d1728","nextId":"RedditPost-037b3f66-cc08-5c75-91fc-62492eb7aa9b","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbqroi/gme_10k_filing_mentions_squeeze/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
