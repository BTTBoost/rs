This rumor started because Canoo moved its headquarter to Bentonville, the home of Walmart headquarters. Canoo also teased during its earnings call that it will be building some prototypes for an unnamed partner, which of course the internet jumped on the idea that it must be Walmart.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a little skeptical of this, since Walmart already has other car partners like Ford and Gatik. Does it make sense to add Canoo?</p>\n\n<p>My thesis is that Canoo is a decent speculative stock even if it doesn&#39;t have this Walmart deal. There&#39;s lots of other tailwinds such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The infrastructure bill.</li>\n<li>Canoo fills a niche that&#39;s not directly competitive against Rivian or Tesla (and definitely not Lucid). For example Canoo would be great for local governments and schools which will be forced to go green and would like vehicles with low maintenance costs.</li>\n<li>The market is hungry for EV stock right now. And at sub $20 this is something people can feel good throwing a few bucks in and hold for years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Possible cons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Worried that Canoo doesn&#39;t manufacture it&#39;s own vehicles.</li>\n<li>Canoo already had one hyped up story with the acquisition talks with Apple. If this Walmart thing go south investors will <em>really</em> hate Canoo.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Possible discussion topics:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Are there <em>other</em> possible reasons to move to Bentonville? Perhaps that city offer huge incentives not seen elsewhere, or maybe it&#39;s actually a great hub of manufacturing. Anyone in that area know?</p></li>\n<li><p>How does Canoo stack up against other EV &quot;hype&quot; stocks right now?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Disclosure: I bought some Canoo this morning, and I kinda like their aesthetic.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qvy3j9/canoo_and_rumored_walmart_deal/","title":"Canoo and rumored Walmart deal","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-17T19:44:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-17 19:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qvy3j9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qvy3j9/canoo_and_rumored_walmart_deal/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qvy3j9/canoo_and_rumored_walmart_deal/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"r2002","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/r2002","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"r2002","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"カヌーと噂されるウォルマートとの取引","the_new_excerpt":"Canoo($GOEV)は、今朝、Walmartをパートナーとして獲得したという噂で23%上昇しています。\nパートナーとして獲得したという噂で、朝から23％上昇しています。この噂は、Canooが本社をWalmart本社のあるBentonvilleに移したことから始まった。\nベントンビルに移転したことから始まった。また、カヌーは決算発表の際に\nこの噂は、Canooが本社をWalmart本社のあるBentonvilleに移したことに端を発しています。また、Canooは決算発表の際に、無名の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"卡努和传闻中的沃尔玛交易","the_new_excerpt":"Canoo（$GOEV）今天上午上涨了23%，因为有传言说它已经找到了沃尔玛作为\n的合作伙伴。这一传言的起因是卡努公司将其总部迁至\n本顿维尔，也就是沃尔玛总部所在地。卡奴还在其收益电话会议上预告\n财报电话会议上，它将为一个不知名的公司建造一些原型。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"卡努和傳聞中的沃爾瑪交易","the_new_excerpt":"Canoo（$GOEV）今天上午上漲了23%，因爲有傳言說它已經找到了沃爾瑪作爲\n的合作伙伴。這一傳言的起因是卡努公司將其總部遷至\n本頓維爾，也就是沃爾瑪總部所在地。卡奴還在其收益電話會議上預告\n財報電話會議上，它將爲一個不知名的公司建造一些原型。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qvta30","excerpt":"Is the industry at large grossly overestimating people's appetite to spend X\namount of time in a video game?\n\nI actually watched facebook's entire presentation on meta.
