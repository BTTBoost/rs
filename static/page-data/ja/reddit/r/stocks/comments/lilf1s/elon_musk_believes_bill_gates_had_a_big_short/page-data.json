Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”</p>\n\n<p>He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.</p>\n\n<p>But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:</p>\n\n<p>“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”</p>\n\n<p>We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://electrek.co/2021/02/12/elon-musk-believes-bill-gates-big-short-position-on-tesla-tsla-lost-money/\">https://electrek.co/2021/02/12/elon-musk-believes-bill-gates-big-short-position-on-tesla-tsla-lost-money/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lilf1s/elon_musk_believes_bill_gates_had_a_big_short/","title":"Elon Musk believes Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA) and lost a lot of money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T00:45:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 00:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"06542362-e3a8-54d5-b4b9-2191a0aa5a98","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lilf1s/elon_musk_believes_bill_gates_had_a_big_short/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lilf1s/elon_musk_believes_bill_gates_had_a_big_short/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"AjaxFC1900","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AjaxFC1900","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"AjaxFC1900","score":644,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"埃隆-马斯克认为比尔-盖茨曾大举做空特斯拉（TSLA），损失惨重","the_new_excerpt":"埃隆-马斯克透露，他听说比尔-盖茨曾大举做空。\n特斯拉(TSLA)，他可能因此损失了很多钱。\n\n亿万富翁马斯克和盖茨对彼此的评价并不总是好的。\n其他，但他们似乎对气候变化有着相似的担忧。\n\n然而，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"埃隆-馬斯克認爲比爾-蓋茨曾大舉做空特斯拉（TSLA），損失慘重","the_new_excerpt":"埃隆-馬斯克透露，他聽說比爾-蓋茨曾大舉做空。\n特斯拉(TSLA)，他可能因此損失了很多錢。\n\n億萬富翁馬斯克和蓋茨對彼此的評價並不總是好的。\n其他，但他們似乎對氣候變化有着相似的擔憂。\n\n然而，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-78041cf8-3ab4-5e06-a5b8-d9799a4e21dd","excerpt":"I'm using two accounts to try and buy a bunch of contracts and just ran across\nsome major fuckery.
