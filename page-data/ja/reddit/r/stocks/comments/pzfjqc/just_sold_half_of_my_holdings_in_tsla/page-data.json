TSLA ended up being a huge blessing for me and my son over the years!\n\n    I made it through work being closed down for 9 months last year and half of this year, and never sold.     \n   So, this step took alot for me, on a personal level.\n\n  Because of my job being effected half of this year, my income was no where close to what it would have normally been...       I decided that selling half would give me some peace of mind with the economic climate where it is. I also knew that with my income being as low as it was this year, that this was possibly the last opportunity to avoid selling in a higher tax bracket.\n\n    Of course, I had this mental struggle between selling and it then going higher.  But I&#39;ve decided to just not let myself think on those terms.\n\n\n   I now feel a security in knowing that if it rises, I still have half my holdings and will enjoy watching my position climb again.  And if it goes down, I will have the option to buy the dip.\n\n   I was surprised at how stubborn my pride was when deciding whether to reduce position or not!   This ride has been wild over the years.\n\n  I&#39;m happy to still be on it! But happy I was able to exercise making a tough decision that I knew was the wisest, for me.\n</code></pre>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzfjqc/just_sold_half_of_my_holdings_in_tsla/","title":"Just sold half of my holdings in TSLA.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-01T21:20:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-01 21:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pzfjqc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzfjqc/just_sold_half_of_my_holdings_in_tsla/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzfjqc/just_sold_half_of_my_holdings_in_tsla/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"siennasolo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/siennasolo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"siennasolo","score":839,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"TSLAの持ち株の半分を売ったところ。","the_new_excerpt":"  数ヶ月間、選択肢を検討した結果、これが私の家族にとって最善の行動であると判断しました。\n\n  シングルマザーとして投資を決意した2015年からTSLAに参加していますが、苦しい時でも売ったことはありませんでした。TSLAは結果的に、私と息子にとって長年にわたる大きな恵みとなりました。\n\n    私は仕事で成功した...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"刚刚卖掉了我在TSLA的一半持股。","the_new_excerpt":"  经过几个月的权衡，我决定这是对我的家庭最好的行动。\n\n  自2015年我决定以单身母亲的身份投资以来，我一直在TSLA，即使在困难时期也从未卖出。多年来，TSLA最终成为我和我儿子的一个巨大的祝福！我通过工作...\n\n    我通过工作...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"剛剛賣掉了我在TSLA的一半持股。","the_new_excerpt":"  經過幾個月的權衡，我決定這是對我的家庭最好的行動。\n\n  自2015年我決定以單身母親的身份投資以來，我一直在TSLA，即使在困難時期也從未賣出。多年來，TSLA最終成爲我和我兒子的一個巨大的祝福！我通過工作...\n\n    我通過工作...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pze3ar","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pze3ar/and_no_luck/","title":"And no luck","date":"October 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"そして運がない","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"而且没有运气","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"而且沒有運氣","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pzga0j","excerpt":"Full article here.\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-29/is-stock-market-rigged-insider-trading-by-executives-is-pervasive-critics-say]\n\nGems include:\n\n\"In 2008 a group of quants from Citigroup Inc. published a paper that found a\nportfolio mirroring insiders’ trades could yield an…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pzga0j/bloomberg_claims_new_research_shows_insider/","title":"Bloomberg claims \"New research shows insider trading is everywhere\"","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 01, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ブルームバーグは \"New research shows insider trading is everywhere \"と主張している。","the_new_excerpt":"記事全文はこちら\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-29/is-stock-market-rigged-insider-trading-by-executives-is-pervasive-critics-say]\n\n逸品は以下の通りです。\n\n「2008年、シティグループ・インクのクォンツのグループが、インサイダーの取引を反映したポートフォリオが\nインサイダーの取引を反映させたポートフォリオは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"彭博社称 \"新研究显示内幕交易无处不在\"","the_new_excerpt":"完整的文章在这里。\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-29/is-stock-market-rigged-insider-trading-by-executives-is-pervasive-critics-say]\n\n宝石包括。\n\n\"2008年，花旗集团的一组数量学家发表了一篇论文，发现了一个\n反映内部人员交易的投资组合可以产生一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"彭博社稱 \"新研究顯示內幕交易無處不在\"","the_new_excerpt":"完整的文章在這裏。\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-29/is-stock-market-rigged-insider-trading-by-executives-is-pervasive-critics-say]\n\n寶石包括。\n\n\"2008年，花旗集團的一組數量學家發表了一篇論文，發現了一個\n反映內部人員交易的投資組合可以產生一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pzfjqc","previousId":"RedditPost-pze3ar","nextId":"RedditPost-pzga0j","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzfjqc/just_sold_half_of_my_holdings_in_tsla/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
