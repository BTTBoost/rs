Expected for Q1.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Coinbase was valued at more than $8 billion in 2018 after a $300 million funding round led by Tiger Global Management.\nThe company, started in 2012, has raised more than $500 million from backers that also include Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator and Greylock Partners, according to its website. Coinbase said it has has more than 35 million verified users in more than 100 countries and more than $25 billion in assets on its platform.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>If you are a little bit tech-savvy you can already get in through so-called preipo contracts</strong> see:\n<a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/khx0rj/get_ik_before_wall_street_the_coinbase_pre_ipo/\">https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/khx0rj/get_ik_before_wall_street_the_coinbase_pre_ipo/</a></p>\n\n<p>Coinbase is the goto exchange for cryptocurrencies in the USA. They are selling shovels during the goldrush.</p>\n\n<p>That said 60B is an extreme value. Too much I would say. I still think it is a good play upto actual IPO day. Short term: long, long term: short. I expect this to be one of the biggest IPOs of 2021. Recently traditional media have been spending more and more attention to bitcoin and crypto, so their audiences are warmed up and afraid to miss out.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: The Pre IPO is not open for US Citizens.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;CM-Equity is fully regulated in Germany, and is a licensed financial institution permitted to offer these products.  All FTX users who trade tokenized stocks may also have to become customers of CM-Equity, and pass through CM-Equity&#39;s KYC and compliance.  Furthermore, all trading activity may be monitored for compliance by CM-Equity.  CM-Equity custodies the equities at a third party brokerage firm.  CM-Equity (not FTX Trading LTD) provides the brokerage services. In order to trade tokenized stocks on FTX, you must be at least KYC level 2.  Once you are, you can go to your tokenized stocks KYC page to submit your information to CM-Equity.  You must also not be a member of one of FTX&#39;s restricted jurisdictions, including the United States; FTX collects KYC documents and IP addresses from its users.  FTX does not operate in its restricted jurisdictions.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The preipo contracts will convert to tokenized shares at the end of IPO day. The tokenized shares are backed 1 on 1 by the actual shares. If Coinbase for whatever reason does not go public before 21st of june 2022 (1.5 year from now) the contracts will be cash settled at 32 USD.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ki9ijf/coinbase_will_ipo_in_2021_already_valued_at_60b/","title":"Coinbase will IPO in 2021, already valued at 60B in pre IPO markets","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 22, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-22T18:43:18.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-22 18:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f1dc02a5-3c3a-503d-9cd8-caeea094569b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ki9ijf/coinbase_will_ipo_in_2021_already_valued_at_60b/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ki9ijf/coinbase_will_ipo_in_2021_already_valued_at_60b/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"toplelkekfag","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/toplelkekfag","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"toplelkekfag","score":1413,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Coinbase将于2021年首次公开募股，在IPO前市场的估值已达600亿美元","the_new_excerpt":"Coinbase将于2021年上市。预计在第一季度。\n\n>“Coinbase在3亿美元之后，2018年的估值超过80亿美元\n>由老虎全球管理公司牵头的一轮融资。该公司成立于2012年，\n>已经从包括安德森在内的支持者那里筹集了超过5亿美元\n>霍洛维茨，Y…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coinbase將於2021年首次公開募股，在IPO前市場的估值已達600億美元","the_new_excerpt":"Coinbase將於2021年上市。預計在第一季度。\n\n>“Coinbase在3億美元之後，2018年的估值超過80億美元\n>由老虎全球管理公司牽頭的一輪融資。該公司成立於2012年，\n>已經從包括安德森在內的支持者那裏籌集了超過5億美元\n>霍洛維茨，Y…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1341399274744102913","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1341399274744102913","title":"2020 Global Growth Rates (Real GDP)... https://t.co/B880EWj4It","date":"December 22, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"2020年全球增长率(实际GDP).https://t.co/B880EWj4It","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"2020年全球增長率(實際GDP).https://t.co/B880EWj4It","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-29fe8b21-da33-52b8-9648-8b33d7cf69c4","excerpt":"Does anyone know a reason for GME up so much, or is this the beginning of the\nshort-squeeze?
