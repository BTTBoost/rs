Take Lowe&#39;s today for example. It blasted earnings. It literally doubled them. 8th earnings in a row it has smashed, and today it&#39;s down. Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is dropping. (I dont own it btw, so this isn&#39;t a rant on that basis)</p>\n\n<p>I know the argument is &quot;ThE WhoLE MaRkEt Is DoWn&quot;. Sorry, no, I don&#39;t buy this bullshit.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at todays winners;</p>\n\n<p>Advaxis is the 2nd biggest gainer today and is up 21%. It&#39;s a garbage fucking pennystock that trades at 0.58 cents. Even worse, it&#39;s a bullshit pharma stock. Normal volume is 6 million. Volume today - 166 million. There is no news to justify this interest</p>\n\n<p>Mosys is the big winner so far, up 33%. Another bullshit $5 stock. Normal volume is 2 mil. No news, but today the volume is 30x the norm.</p>\n\n<p>LifeMD has had lawsuits filed against it today, about claims its directors have comitted fraud. Even better;</p>\n\n<p><strong>LifeMD appears to use unlicensed doctors to dispense OTC medications, has implemented an autoshipping/autobilling scheme, failed to honor guarantees, and put in place abusive telemarketing practices.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So what does the stock do in response to this? Of course, it jumps 12%.</p>\n\n<p>To end my rant, the 3rd placed highest today is another bullshit company, a Chinese medical company called Lianluo Smart. There&#39;s one single news article linking it to a takeover by newegg or something, the news article made little sense. Low and behold, normal volume is 400k, today it&#39;s 9 million. Even if the news is to be believed, this one single article was posted 1 hour ago, yet the price suddenly spiked 2 hours ago.</p>\n\n<p>So, why do companies that do well, make money, smash earnings lose their stock value, and bullshit, nonsense companies get P&amp;D so much. This is a daily occurance. Every single day I see a new company increasing its share price by 50%+ and it&#39;s nonsense. I thought P&amp;D&#39;s were illegal.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m losing (lost tbh) all faith in the market and it feels more and more like a (rigged) casino every day now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ngcedr/can_anyone_explain_why_earnings_no_longer_matter/","title":"Can anyone explain why earnings no longer matter, and the entire market is just pump&dump after pump&dump?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-19T19:30:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-19 19:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1893dc94-7d0c-5e84-ba65-071ac1035544","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ngcedr/can_anyone_explain_why_earnings_no_longer_matter/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ngcedr/can_anyone_explain_why_earnings_no_longer_matter/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"electricp0ww0w","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/electricp0ww0w","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"electricp0ww0w","score":9167,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"なぜ業績が重要でなくなり、市場全体がポンプ＆ダンプに次ぐポンプ＆ダンプになっているのか、誰か説明できますか？","the_new_excerpt":"私はこのクソを本当に理解していない。\n\n今では、ある会社の業績が良くて、そのために株価が下がるということがよくあります。\nします。今日のロウズを例にとってみましょう。最高の業績でした。文字通り2倍になりました。\n倍にしました。8回連続で収益を上げましたが、今日は下がってしまいました。文字通り、あなたは\nある会社がそれを造語として使っています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"谁能解释一下为什么收益不再重要，而整个市场只是一个又一个的抽水机和抽水机？","the_new_excerpt":"我真的不明白这个狗屎。\n\n现在所有的时间，一个公司表现良好，而股票价格却因此而下跌\n它。以Lowe's今天为例。它的收益爆棚。它实际上是翻了一番\n他们。它已经连续第8次盈利了，而今天它又下跌了。从字面上看，你\n有一家公司创造了它...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰能解釋一下爲什麼收益不再重要，而整個市場只是一個又一個的抽水機和抽水機？","the_new_excerpt":"我真的不明白這個狗屎。\n\n現在所有的時間，一個公司表現良好，而股票價格卻因此而下跌\n它。以Lowe's今天爲例。它的收益爆棚。它實際上是翻了一番\n他們。它已經連續第8次盈利了，而今天它又下跌了。從字面上看，你\n有一家公司創造了它...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1394999338175184910","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1394999338175184910","title":"What Bitcoin looked like when it first hit $36k and what it looks like today. https://t.co/X3IL13y4YG","date":"May 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ビットコインが初めて36kドルになった時の様子と現在の様子 https://t.co/X3IL13y4YG。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"比特币刚达到3.6万美元时的样子和今天的样子。https://t.co/X3IL13y4YG","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"比特幣剛達到3.6萬美元時的樣子和今天的樣子。https://t.co/X3IL13y4YG","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a8892e2a-afc4-5b5a-97f1-358e5f9c4dc2","excerpt":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-announces-4-billion-share-162100452.html\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., May 19, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD [https://www.amd.com/]\n(NASDAQ: AMD) today announced that its Board of Directors approved a new share\nrepurchase program.
