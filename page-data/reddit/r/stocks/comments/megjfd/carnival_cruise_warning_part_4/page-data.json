New industry news just hit yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>Florida Governor Ron Desantis has issued a demand that the CDC lift the sail restrictions on the cruise industry.  He has threatened lawsuits if needed.  Many seem to think this is a good thing.  I believe just the opposite.  Here is why.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This is very political now.  Doesn&#39;t make it right or wrong.  It just is.  Biden&#39;s CDC will not allow itself to be bullied by someone who many view to be a Trump knockoff.  It doesn&#39;t matter where you fall politically.  We have two forces that will refuse to give in and currently the CDC has the upper hand.</li>\n<li>Desantis&#39; lawsuit won&#39;t go anywhere.  The CDC will very easily be able to make its case as to why they think allowing cruising would be a safety hazard.  They will point to the virus variants, the unknowns about them and the surge in Europe.  Also a Florida University Epidemiologist is quoted saying:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Cindy Prins, a University of Florida epidemiologist, defended the ban, saying it is still too early for cruise ships to operate. Unlike other modes of transportation, families and groups on cruises mingle and dine together for long periods, increasing the likelihood of spread, she said, and testing and symptom screening are not perfect methods of prevention. &quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>So the CDC will easily be able to make their case if a lawsuit happens.  They have many examples to give to show how they came to their decision.</p>\n\n<p>3) Both the cruise industry and Gov. Desantis have stated that people should not be required to get vaccinated in order to go on a cruise.  This is just foolish on their part.  The CDC will never go for that and the public would probably agree.  Most of the bullish types on here cite vaccines as a reason Carnival will recover.  But Carnival and Desantis are both saying that vaccines shouldn&#39;t be a requirement.</p>\n\n<p>Finally.  I believe that if Gov Desantis has done anything he has just brought attention to the major problem the cruise industry is having.  People smell blood in the water now.  I would not be surprised if formerly unaware investors are now getting concerned and thinking about dumping their positions until things turn around.</p>\n\n<p>I am posting a link to show where I got my information.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://abc7.com/when-are-cruises-resuming-royal-caribbean-cdc-cruise-guidelines/10452259/\">https://abc7.com/when-are-cruises-resuming-royal-caribbean-cdc-cruise-guidelines/10452259/</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Adding an update:</p>\n\n<p>Royal Caribbean is now receiving boycott threats all because they planned a few fully vaccinated cruises.  The idea that vaccinations are being well received is incorrect and many people won&#39;t be getting them.  This will be an issue moving forward.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/royal-caribbean-says-boycott-cruise-120700142.html\">https://news.yahoo.com/royal-caribbean-says-boycott-cruise-120700142.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Another Update:</p>\n\n<p>Norwegian just canceled a bunch of summer cruises.  They notified customers that they were bailing.  Norwegian is redeploying.  Some suspect that they will be operating out of non US ports now.  Carnival president has already stated they are not leaving US ports.  So if Norwegian is leaving because they believe summer sailing from the US is a no go then Carnival is screwed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cruiseradio.net/norwegian-cancels-cruises-on-five-ships-teases-exciting-news/\">https://cruiseradio.net/norwegian-cancels-cruises-on-five-ships-teases-exciting-news/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/megjfd/carnival_cruise_warning_part_4/","title":"Carnival Cruise Warning Part 4","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-28T04:37:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-28 04:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ba49ca46-e5ad-5a9e-af2e-4684b45c6023","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/megjfd/carnival_cruise_warning_part_4/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/megjfd/carnival_cruise_warning_part_4/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TheXorzox","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheXorzox","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TheXorzox","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"嘉年华邮轮警告第四部分","the_new_excerpt":"继续我对嘉年华邮轮的看空论述。新的行业消息刚刚传来\n昨日。\n\n佛罗里达州州长罗恩-德桑提斯已发出要求疾控中心解除帆。\n对邮轮业的限制。他曾威胁说，如果需要的话，将提起诉讼。许多\n似乎认为这是一件好事。我相信只是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"嘉年華郵輪警告第四部分","the_new_excerpt":"繼續我對嘉年華郵輪的看空論述。新的行業消息剛剛傳來\n昨日。\n\n佛羅里達州州長羅恩-德桑提斯已發出要求疾控中心解除帆。\n對郵輪業的限制。他曾威脅說，如果需要的話，將提起訴訟。許多\n似乎認爲這是一件好事。我相信只是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-55a5b63e-bb03-5feb-b8d3-179ed4a3931d","excerpt":"I was Aping around on reddit Friday night.
