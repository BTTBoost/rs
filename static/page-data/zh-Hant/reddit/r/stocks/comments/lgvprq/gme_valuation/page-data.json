That yeilds a post-turnaround share price of at least $200.</p>\n\n<p>If we go further than this and assume Cohen can permanently increase GME&#39;s gross margins (digital sales of exclusive games), the sky is the limit. GME <a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-exclusive-gamestop-value-worth/\">already sells</a> exclusive games, so this is not a huge stretch.</p>\n\n<p>For those saying the console makers and game studios don&#39;t want GameStop to thrive: Amazon can simply add games to prime and become a real pain in the ass to all those console makers and game studios.
