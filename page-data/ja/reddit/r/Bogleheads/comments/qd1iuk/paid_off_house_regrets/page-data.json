Starting to think about doing a cash out refi and investing in a mix of vtsax/vtiax and maybe 10% in bonds for a couple years in case the market tanks a lot. Ik statistically this isnt the smartest play but would help me sleep at night knowing i could buy the dip if we had a huge drop. I would eventually invest it.</p>\n\n<p>Statistically my money will double every 7 years assuming a 10% return which ik is being generous but I will still be contributing along the way so if its lower i will make up for it. This means my money will double 5 times which when I do the math after adding what is already invested comes out to a very large number. Although im putting a lot into invesments right now due to the increased cashflow, I feel like putting the 250-300k in the market now while im young would be huge for me later on in life</p>\n\n<p>Obv i would have a mortgage but Im figuring if sh*t hits the fan i can always downsize or rent to make sure i dont touch my investments..</p>\n\n<p>I absolutely LOVE having a paid for house and living a debt free lifestyle. This is very tempting the more i think about it though…\nThoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qd1iuk/paid_off_house_regrets/","title":"Paid Off House (Regrets?)","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"October 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-22T02:18:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-22 02:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qd1iuk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qd1iuk/paid_off_house_regrets/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qd1iuk/paid_off_house_regrets/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"boats_n_hoezz","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/boats_n_hoezz","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"boats_n_hoezz","score":30,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"家の払い下げ（後悔？","the_new_excerpt":"30歳にもなっていないのに、風前のともしびで35万円の家を手に入れた。それ以外の\n借金はしていません。キャッシュアウトリファイをして、VTSAX/VTIAXのミックスに投資することを考え始めています。\nVTSAXとVTIAXの組み合わせに投資して、市場が大暴落した場合に備えて、数年間は10%程度の債券に投資しようと考えています。\nと考えています。統計的には最も賢明な方法ではないかもしれませんが...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"已付清的房子（后悔了？","the_new_excerpt":"还不到30岁，就因为一笔意外之财而拥有了35万的已付房款。没有其他\n债务。开始考虑做一个现金出让的再融资，并投资于混合的\nvtsax/vtiax的混合投资，也许还有10%的债券投资几年，以防市场大跌。\n以防市场大跌。从统计学上看，这不是最聪明的做法，但会...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"已付清的房子（後悔了？","the_new_excerpt":"還不到30歲，就因爲一筆意外之財而擁有了35萬的已付房款。沒有其他\n債務。開始考慮做一個現金出讓的再融資，並投資於混合的\nvtsax/vtiax的混合投資，也許還有10%的債券投資幾年，以防市場大跌。\n以防市場大跌。從統計學上看，這不是最聰明的做法，但會...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qd0dn6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qd0dn6/presenting_daddy_trumps_golden_showers_3k13k_gainz/","title":"Presenting Daddy Trump's Golden Showers: 3k->13k GAINZ","date":"October 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ダディ・トランプのゴールデン・シャワーをプレゼント。3K->13K GAINZ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"呈现特朗普爸爸的金色淋浴。3k->13k GAINZ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"呈現特朗普爸爸的金色淋浴。3k->13k GAINZ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1450569056764010502","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1450569056764010502","title":"This weekend is gonna be lit with 50% of cops out in Chicago","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 22, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"この週末は、シカゴの警官の50％が出払っているため、光り輝くことでしょう。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"芝加哥50%的警察出动，这个周末会很热闹。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"芝加哥50%的警察出動，這個週末會很熱鬧。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qd1iuk","previousId":"RedditPost-qd0dn6","nextId":"TweetPost-1450569056764010502","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qd1iuk/paid_off_house_regrets/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
