As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfb5jt/tesla_tsla_bought_15_billion_worth_of_bitcoin_btc/","title":"Tesla (TSLA) bought 1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-08T14:43:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-08 14:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"892fd29e-cbe8-56d5-b7f2-d8d43a0320e9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfb5jt/tesla_tsla_bought_15_billion_worth_of_bitcoin_btc/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfb5jt/tesla_tsla_bought_15_billion_worth_of_bitcoin_btc/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"PomeloWarrior","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PomeloWarrior","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PomeloWarrior","score":6102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"特斯拉（TSLA）买入价值15亿的比特币（BTC）。","the_new_excerpt":"> 2021年1月，我们更新了投资政策，为我们提供了更多的。\n> 灵活性，以进一步分散和最大限度地提高我们的现金回报，而这些现金并不在我们手中。\n> 需要保持足够的经营流动性。作为该政策的一部分。\n> 经本公司董事会审计委员会正式批准，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉（TSLA）買入價值15億的比特幣（BTC）。","the_new_excerpt":"> 2021年1月，我們更新了投資政策，爲我們提供了更多的。\n> 靈活性，以進一步分散和最大限度地提高我們的現金回報，而這些現金並不在我們手中。\n> 需要保持足夠的經營流動性。作爲該政策的一部分。\n> 經本公司董事會審計委員會正式批准，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f0ab95af-efb4-5232-8715-820928bc2bce","excerpt":"Not sure if the title explains exactly what I mean but I'm always intrigued\nabout the psychology behind people who prefer to buy dead beat companies because\nthe price is low rather than the companies of tomorrow because the price is\nhigh.\n\nIt's a pretty simple decision when you think about it right?…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfaqo3/the_psychology_behind_buying_dead_beat_companies/","title":"The psychology behind buying dead beat companies because the price is low vs the companies of tomorrow because the price is high.","date":"February 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"因为价格低而买入死拍公司与因为价格高而买入明日公司的心理。","the_new_excerpt":"不知道标题是否能准确地解释我的意思，但我总是很好奇。\n关于人们喜欢购买死气沉沉的公司背后的心理，是因为\n价格低，而不是明天的公司，因为价格是。\n高。\n\n你想想看，这是个很简单的决定，对吧？...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"因爲價格低而買入死拍公司與因爲價格高而買入明日公司的心理。","the_new_excerpt":"不知道標題是否能準確地解釋我的意思，但我總是很好奇。\n關於人們喜歡購買死氣沉沉的公司背後的心理，是因爲\n價格低，而不是明天的公司，因爲價格是。\n高。\n\n你想想看，這是個很簡單的決定，對吧？...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7644d2de-bdde-592d-a34c-a0ee3be3d885","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lewlxg/only_diamond_hands_will_prevail/","title":"Only diamond hands will prevail","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 08, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"只有钻石手才会获胜","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"只有鑽石手纔會獲勝","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-892fd29e-cbe8-56d5-b7f2-d8d43a0320e9","previousId":"RedditPost-f0ab95af-efb4-5232-8715-820928bc2bce","nextId":"RedditPost-7644d2de-bdde-592d-a34c-a0ee3be3d885","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfb5jt/tesla_tsla_bought_15_billion_worth_of_bitcoin_btc/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
