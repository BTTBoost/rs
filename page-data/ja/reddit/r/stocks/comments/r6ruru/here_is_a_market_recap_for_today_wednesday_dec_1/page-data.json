After opening higher in the morning stocks slid steeply downwards as market participants digested new remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and new concerns surrounding the coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant, with the US detecting its first case in California earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable Numbers Today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.10%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.7%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dow Jones (DIA): -1.29%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meta (FB): -4.27%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tesla (TSLA): -4.35%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SPY Airline ETF: -3.27%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;VIX: +3.77%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alibaba (BABA): -4.10%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At around 1 p.m. ET, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that it identified the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus Omicron variant in the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters the person was a traveler who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22 and tested positive on Nov. 29. Fauci said the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot and was experiencing “mild symptoms.” On November 26, &lt;a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/26/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/\"&gt;President Biden’s administration announced it was instituting a travel ban on South Africa &lt;/a&gt;and other African nations in an effort to curb the spread. The US now joins about two dozen countries that have detected the coronavirus Omicron virus. The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa on November 24.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, “There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level we had with [the] Delta [variant]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f\"&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Powell said, ““We tend to use [the word transitory] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.&amp;quot; -Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r6ruru/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_dec_1/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Dec 1, 2021.
