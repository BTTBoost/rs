If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company’s operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K?</p>\n\n<p>Someone lied. It&#39;s either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let&#39;s be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like).</p>\n\n<p>This lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration&#39;s proposed ban in American court).</p>\n\n<p>Unless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/</a>; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/</a>). The risk is just not worth it. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why_nio_will_be_the_next_apple_and_the_leader_of/h38v0qm/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why_nio_will_be_the_next_apple_and_the_leader_of/h38v0qm/</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: oh, right! I forgot to mention all the widespread reverse merger scams that plagued the markets a decade ago: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_21st-century_Chinese_reverse_mergers\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_21st-century_Chinese_reverse_mergers</a></p>\n\n<p>INB4:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they&#39;ve been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, *including* by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Tell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud?</p>\n\n<p>There is no reciprocity. And that&#39;s the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and *there is nothing you can do about it* (unlike foreign investors here in the US).</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ohh, silly person, China wouldn&#39;t shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps</a> . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it&#39;s more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Edit</p>\n\n<p>INB4 no. 3: You and this post are racist. It’s racist to point out that either the CCP or Didi is bilking investors here of all ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, this is a common wumao tactic often used on social media. They’ve learned they can deflect from the CCP’s misdeeds by crying any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist.</p>\n\n<p>Edit edit:\nHell, let’s go even further! Assume I am indeed a racist (I’m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of <em>anything</em> I’ve said here?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofo6u0/didi_took_13_billion_in_cash_from_american/","title":"Didi took $13 billion in cash from American investors and days later the Chinese government shutdown the app.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-08T00:15:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-08 00:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"22382dae-fb85-5710-9fb8-aa1fee205cc1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofo6u0/didi_took_13_billion_in_cash_from_american/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofo6u0/didi_took_13_billion_in_cash_from_american/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"RomulusAugustus753","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RomulusAugustus753","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"RomulusAugustus753","score":6291,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Didiはアメリカの投資家から130億ドルの現金を奪い、その数日後には中国政府がアプリを停止させました。","the_new_excerpt":"さらに、中国共産党は現在、外国人投資家が \"i-i \"を持っているVariable Interest Entity（VIE）構造を廃止することを議論しています。\n外国人投資家が中国企業に「投資」してきたVIE（Variable Interest Entity）構造の廃止が議論されています。\nの廃止を検討しています。\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/\n\nVIEについての入門書は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"滴滴从美国投资者那里拿了130亿美元的现金，几天后，中国政府关闭了该应用程序。","the_new_excerpt":"而且，最重要的是，中国共产党现在正在讨论废除可变利益实体（VIE）的问题。\n实体（VIE）结构，外国投资者通过该结构 \"投资 \"于中国公司。\n中国的公司。\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/\n\n关于VIE的入门知识...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"滴滴從美國投資者那裏拿了130億美元的現金，幾天後，中國政府關閉了該應用程序。","the_new_excerpt":"而且，最重要的是，中國共產黨現在正在討論廢除可變利益實體（VIE）的問題。\n實體（VIE）結構，外國投資者通過該結構 \"投資 \"於中國公司。\n中國的公司。\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/\n\n關於VIE的入門知識...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-67ec606e-b945-5c64-b2fe-3ad516669d3f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofp21k/state_of_the_sub/","title":"State of the Sub","date":"July 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"サブの状態","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"子的状况","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"子的狀況","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2ccd3b6f-98eb-5454-825e-bd60e9128d62","excerpt":"Your daily hype thread.
