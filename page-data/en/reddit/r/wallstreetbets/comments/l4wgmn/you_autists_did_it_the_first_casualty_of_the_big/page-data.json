Melvin started the year with $12.5 billion and had been one of the best performing hedge funds on Wall Street in recent years. The losses stem from Melvin’s array of short-bets against companies and have stunned clients and other traders.</p>\n\n<p>Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion invested in Melvin as of 2019, $750 million. The investments are for non-controlling revenue shares in the hedge fund.
