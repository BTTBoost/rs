It’s happening.” Wood estimates that her hypothesis will start to play out sometime after the holidays.</p>\n\n<p>“In 2008-09, when the Fed started quantitative easing, I thought that inflation would take off. I was wrong. Instead, velocity - the rate at which money turns over per year - declined, taking away its inflationary sting. Velocity still is falling,” Wood said in a tweet.</p>\n\n<p>“When costs and prices decline, velocity and disinflation - if not deflation - follow. If consumers and businesses believe that prices will fall in the future, they will wait to buy buy goods and services, pushing the velocity of money down,” she added.</p>\n\n<p>“Now we believe that three sources of deflation will overcome the supply chain-induced inflation that is wreaking havoc on the global economy. Two sources are secular, or long term, and one is cyclical. Technologically enabled innovation is deflationary and the most potent source,” Wood said in the Twitter thread.</p>\n\n<p>“As a result, once the holiday season passes and companies face excess supplies, prices should unwind. Some commodity prices - lumber and iron ore - already have dropped 50%, China’s crackdowns are one of the reasons. The oil price is an outlier and psychologically important,” Wood said.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/cathie-wood-disputes-jack-dorseys-hyperinflation-warning-says-prices-will-fall-after-holidays.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.\">Link via CNBC</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qgdzi5/cathie_wood_disputes_jack_dorseys_hyperinflation/","title":"Cathie Wood disputes Jack Dorsey’s hyperinflation warning, says prices will fall after holidays","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-26T23:34:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-26 23:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qgdzi5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qgdzi5/cathie_wood_disputes_jack_dorseys_hyperinflation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qgdzi5/cathie_wood_disputes_jack_dorseys_hyperinflation/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"juaggo_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/juaggo_","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"juaggo_","score":113,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"キャシー・ウッドがジャック・ドーシーのハイパーインフレ警告に異議を唱え、休日明けに物価が下がると発言","the_new_excerpt":"イノベーション投資家のキャシー・ウッドは月曜日、TwitterとSquareの創業者である\nジャック・ドーシーのハイパーインフレに関する説を紹介しました。\n\nアーク・インベストの創業者兼CEOであるキャシー・ウッドは、ツイッター上で、デフレに関する彼女の逆説を展開しました。\nドーシーが金曜日の夜に「ハイパーインフレは変化する。\nis going to change...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"凯西-伍德对杰克-多尔西的恶性通货膨胀警告提出异议，称节后物价将下降","the_new_excerpt":"创新投资者Cathie Wood周一反驳了Twitter和Square创始人\n杰克-多尔西关于恶性通货膨胀的理论。\n\n方舟投资的创始人兼首席执行官在Twitter上阐述了她关于通货紧缩的逆向理论。\n在多尔西周五晚间发推特称 \"恶性通货膨胀\n将会改变...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"凱西-伍德對傑克-多爾西的惡性通貨膨脹警告提出異議，稱節後物價將下降","the_new_excerpt":"創新投資者Cathie Wood週一反駁了Twitter和Square創始人\n傑克-多爾西關於惡性通貨膨脹的理論。\n\n方舟投資的創始人兼首席執行官在Twitter上闡述了她關於通貨緊縮的逆向理論。\n在多爾西周五晚間發推特稱 \"惡性通貨膨脹\n將會改變...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qgae6y","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qgae6y/its_the_most_fun_i_have_each_day/","title":"It’s the most fun I have each day","date":"October 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"毎日の生活が一番楽しい","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"这是我每天最开心的事情。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"這是我每天最開心的事情。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qgfgi0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qgfgi0/found_a_fellow_retard_in_lecture/","title":"Found a fellow retard in lecture","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 26, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"講義中に知恵遅れの仲間を発見","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"在讲座中发现了一个弱智的同伴","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在講座中發現了一個弱智的同伴","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qgdzi5","previousId":"RedditPost-qgae6y","nextId":"RedditPost-qgfgi0","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qgdzi5/cathie_wood_disputes_jack_dorseys_hyperinflation/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
