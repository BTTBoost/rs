Every night, I can feel my leg... and my arm... even my fingers.... the body I’ve lost... the comrades we’ve all lost... won’t stop hurting... it’s like they’re all still there. You feel it too, don’t you?</p>\n\n<p>Currently down 72.55%, still hanging on. AMC has mitigated bankruptcy so I’ll make it back sooner or later, but not gonna lie having diamond hands is rough some days. I dedicated a pretty small portion of my portfolio to AMC/GME and am still holding. Dumped in $2.7k sitting at a whopping $730 as of writing this. We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we’ll see a rebound. So I’ll keep holding</p>\n\n<p>Position: 107 shares &amp; 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $80.12 avg, holding out there too</p>\n\n<p>Edit: stop telling me to sell. I’m not a pussy and would rather lose 100% than sell and admit I made a mistake</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: to the guy who said “AMC just sells overpriced popcorn and the ability to sit in a seat” but who’s comment was deleted: Uhh, yeah. No shit Sherlock. Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it’ll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe. Situations like this is just a roulette table but there’s a small weak magnet under all the numbers where we lose money. Go look it up if you want, or laugh at my pain, I genuinely could not care less</p>\n\n<p>EDIT3: <strong>Were going up after hours +2.18%</strong> this is it boys <em>and girls</em>, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. tomorrow could be the day it rises up to $420.69, here are some rockets to signify my strong belief in the underlying company and my love for the stock 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg6nf1/starting_to_think_amc_might_not_go_to_42069/","title":"Starting to think AMC might not go to $420.69","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T02:06:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 02:06","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a94aa619-1000-52a6-bba1-58ee7754ef3f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg6nf1/starting_to_think_amc_might_not_go_to_42069/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg6nf1/starting_to_think_amc_might_not_go_to_42069/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"kirlandwater","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/kirlandwater","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"kirlandwater","score":3338,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"开始觉得AMC可能不会到420.69美元了","the_new_excerpt":"我们为什么还在这里？就为了受罪？每天晚上，我都能感觉到我的腿... ... 还有我的...\n手臂... 甚至手指... .... 我失去的身体... 我们失去的战友...\n不会停止伤害... 就像他们都还在那里。你也感觉到了，不是吗？\n你呢？\n\n目前下跌72.55%，还在坚持。AMC已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"開始覺得AMC可能不會到420.69美元了","the_new_excerpt":"我們爲什麼還在這裏？就爲了受罪？每天晚上，我都能感覺到我的腿... ... 還有我的...\n手臂... 甚至手指... .... 我失去的身體... 我們失去的戰友...\n不會停止傷害... 就像他們都還在那裏。你也感覺到了，不是嗎？\n你呢？\n\n目前下跌72.55%，還在堅持。AMC已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1359280272156598276","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1359280272156598276","title":"Copper closed at its highest level in 8 years... https://t.co/eZjzRhLHQd","date":"February 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"铜收于8年来最高水平...... https://t.co/eZjzRhLHQd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"銅收於8年來最高水平...... https://t.co/eZjzRhLHQd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-16f56b4f-6c98-5980-b78e-5e8e38f77b45","excerpt":"I wanted to share my YOLO story with everyone!
