When we crossed the $50 mark around 2:40pm today, they needed to start hedging really heavily since there was ~25,000 volume on the $50 calls, plus another ~23,000 volume on the $60 calls (plus all the volume in between). So they started hedging by buying shares around 2:45pm, and that&#39;s why the price started to moon from then until EOD.</p>\n\n<p>During the January gamma squeeze, the higher prices held for 3-5 days because of heavy retail buying <strong>but also because of the shorts covering.</strong> Plotkin said under oath that they closed out their shorts in January and I doubt he lied, and I&#39;m sure a lot of other HFs did as well. So the majority of shorts closed back then, or most of the short squeeze happened then.</p>\n\n<p>But this time around, the high prices can only be sustained because of retail buying--there is nowhere near the same amount of shorts covering as there was in January. <strong>Retail (we) may not have enough buying power to sustain this high price without help from shorts covering,</strong> and so any HFs that are still short can probably do short ladders or whatever other tactics to drop the price tomorrow, and this time there is no short covering to help sustain the price. So I think this could drop hard tomorrow, as in quicker than the ~3-5 days it took in January.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, if the price does start to drop somewhat significantly, the MMs can start to un-hedge their options that now are OTM, which means they&#39;d be selling large amounts of the shares they just bought today, essentially causing a reverse gamma squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>If by chance retail buying surprises me and is really strong tomorrow, then we can sustain a price above $168 or wherever we open tomorrow. That or if some big institutional money sees an opportunity here and joins in the buying. I&#39;m hoping either or both of these is the case tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Took profits during the January gamma squeeze + short squeeze. Holding 50 shares leftover from then.</p>\n\n<p>Obligatory Disclaimer: This content is for informational purposes only. I am not a financial advisor.
