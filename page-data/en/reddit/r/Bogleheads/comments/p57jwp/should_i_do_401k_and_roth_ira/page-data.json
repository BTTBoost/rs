I have had a Roth 401k for a couple of years with my employer (currently contributing 10%) and I recently started to learn more about investing and the importance of compound interest, consistent contributions, Jack Bogle, long term investing, random walks, bla bla bla. In this context I decided to open a Roth IRA and I&#39;ve been doing my best to consistently contribute $500 every month, and also invest in index funds like the total stock market or S&amp;P 500, etc.</p>\n\n<p>A week ago a was talking to a friend about all of this, and I was suggesting that he should learn about investing too, and that he should probably also open a Roth IRA. When he asked why he should do that if he already had a 401k with his employer, I felt like I didn&#39;t have enough good reasons to justify having both. The one thing I was able to say was that with a Roth IRA you have a lot more options of different funds to invest in, but other than that, I couldn&#39;t come up with anything else that sounded convincing lol</p>\n\n<p>Which make me think, should I continue contributing to a Roth IRA like I&#39;m doing now? Is there any real advantage to having an extra account? Or should I just increase the contribution to my current Roth 401k? -Insert old confused Travolta meme-. I know a Roth IRA is a great investment tool, but I just would like to have more reasons why using both is a good idea (or maybe it&#39;s not!)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if both are good to use side by side, how would you invest in them so that you make them function effectively and efficiently?</p>\n\n<p>I know, a lot of questions, sorry, but I appreciate any information, opinions and/or recommendations 😘</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p57jwp/should_i_do_401k_and_roth_ira/","title":"Should I do 401k AND Roth IRA?","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-16T13:40:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-16 13:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9576dc6d-f089-52da-a2f8-0ca81e294921","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p57jwp/should_i_do_401k_and_roth_ira/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p57jwp/should_i_do_401k_and_roth_ira/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"CinematicJohn","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CinematicJohn","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"CinematicJohn","score":15,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"401kとRoth IRAの両方を行うべきでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。私は数年前から雇用主のRoth 401kを利用しています（現在は10％拠出）。\n10%を拠出しています）。最近、投資について、また複利計算の重要性について学び始めました。\n複利の重要性、継続的な拠出、ジャック・ボーグル、長期投資、ランダム・ウォーク、などなど。\n長期投資、ランダムウォーク、などなど。このような背景から、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我应该做401k和Roth IRA吗？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。我在我的雇主那里有一个Roth 401k，已经有几年了（目前为10%）。\n我最近开始学习更多关于投资和复利的重要性。\n复利的重要性，持续的贡献，杰克-博格尔，长期的\n投资，随机漫步，bla bla bla。在这种情况下，我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我應該做401k和Roth IRA嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。我在我的僱主那裏有一個Roth 401k，已經有幾年了（目前爲10%）。\n我最近開始學習更多關於投資和複利的重要性。\n複利的重要性，持續的貢獻，傑克-博格爾，長期的\n投資，隨機漫步，bla bla bla。在這種情況下，我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5500dd16-d9c7-5b84-8776-530d08bcd474","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p5dvsc/super_wallstreet_bros_bets_2/","title":"Super Wallstreet Bros.
