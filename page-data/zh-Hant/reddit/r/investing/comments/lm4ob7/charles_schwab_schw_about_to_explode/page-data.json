Today I wanted to show you the shinning light that is Charles Schwab and why the good old boy is going to have a red hot few years.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sellable Story</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Look you may not like it but an important part of having a stock rise a good amount comes from how much attention it is going to get from potential buyers, and the more democratized the market gets the more important this is. Most fucking people aren&#39;t scraping through the bottom of the barrel to find random stocks. They&#39;re listening to the news, reading forums, and seeing what company everybody is talking about and then choosing to buy it. This means that the more you have that stock talked about the more potential buyers you have - Don&#39;t believe me it&#39;s literally just the logical extension of the Cramer Effect.</p>\n\n<p>So what Schwab&#39;s sellable story - The flood of retail investors. In case you live under an actual rock, retail investors just like you are popping up like crazy, and since everybody has got those sweet sweet stimulus checks and have only been saving for months due to the lockdown, they all got money burning a hole in their pocket. Not to mention everybody is bored so what do you do that gets the blood pumping when the most movement you get is when you walk from your bed to your desk each day? You grip it and rip it on stocks. Don&#39;t believe it look at Schwabs January 2021 Activity Report:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_jan2021_press_release.pdf\">https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_jan2021_press_release.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>They added over a million new accounts in January. That&#39;s an insane number. Now I know what your thinking, but they added 14 Million in October and 1.2 Million in May! Yes that&#39;s because they acquired TD Ameritrade and USAA&#39;s investment arm in those months, this is an organic million which is bonkers. They added on a whole USAA in a month organically.</p>\n\n<p>2) Financial Outlook</p>\n\n<p>If you want to see how they have been doing here is their past financials:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_q4_2020_earnings_release.pdf\">https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_q4_2020_earnings_release.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not explaining it all get over it, but basically they&#39;ve been growing like an Australian fire.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to look at is how these financials will look like in a year, and to do that you have to understand one of the major ways that Schwab make its money. When you open an investment account you dump all your little coins in and you buy stock right. Well the thing is even though you put in all these coins most people don&#39;t use them all - in fact on average they leave 12% in cash in the account. Schwab then takes this 12% and invests and keeps the profit, this sort of capital acquiring strategy has been making people rich for years. This does mean there is risk if their investments go badly, in fact this is why they lost some growth in revenue in 2020, its not because they didn&#39;t grow as a company, it&#39;s because the &quot;safe&quot; investments that a firm would take with this sort of stuff got wrecked all over and stayed pretty bad during covid, now its pulling back up though.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this mean - well basically the more people you have with brokerages account the more money you can invest thats why this flood of investors is huge. Further this isnt some temporary jump in investors retail investors have been flooding the market for years and they arent leaving, because people so rarely close their investment account unless you really try to get rid of them (cough cough robinhood). This mean that they have a flood of customers that are going to stay for a long time. This is good because the older you get the more money you put into your account (on average), and according to Schwabs Winter report 53% of their clients are households with a head of house hold less than 41 and they&#39;re typically rich. This means that over time this bump will keep paying out big.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_2021_winter_business_update_020221.pdf\">https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_2021_winter_business_update_020221.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>All of this combined and the bullish technicals mean only one thing - a huge earnings. Now I could go on but I&#39;ve gotten kinda bored writing this but if this is well responded to I&#39;ll give a full analysis including the financials and the technicals.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: 500 shares at 54</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lm4ob7/charles_schwab_schw_about_to_explode/","title":"Charles Schwab (schw) about to explode","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T09:40:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 09:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"73173e5a-921f-57cd-8948-cbb4b91b1133","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm4ob7/charles_schwab_schw_about_to_explode/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lm4ob7/charles_schwab_schw_about_to_explode/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"SomeSortOfBrit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SomeSortOfBrit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SomeSortOfBrit","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"查尔斯-施瓦布(schw)即将爆发。","the_new_excerpt":"燮。今天我想向大家展示的是查尔斯-施瓦布和他的光芒。\n为什么老好人这几年会红红火火？\n\n 1. 可卖的故事\n\n你看，你可能不喜欢它，但一个重要的组成部分，有一个股票上涨了一个很好的。\n数量来自于多少关注度，它将从... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"查爾斯-施瓦布(schw)即將爆發。","the_new_excerpt":"燮。今天我想向大家展示的是查爾斯-施瓦布和他的光芒。\n爲什麼老好人這幾年會紅紅火火？\n\n 1. 可賣的故事\n\n你看，你可能不喜歡它，但一個重要的組成部分，有一個股票上漲了一個很好的。\n數量來自於多少關注度，它將從... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3b0e2731-4ea8-5183-aadd-81f958edca77","excerpt":"According to the CEO & chairman of Interactive Brokers, he said if the trading\nwasn't stopped, it would've for sure crashed the system, as we all suspected,\nbut the truth is, the \"system\" is just them with trillions of dollars, and all\nthis \"crash\" would've done, is transfer the wealth to the rest…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmal0z/gamestop_almost_saved_the_system/","title":"GameStop almost SAVED the system","date":"February 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GameStop几乎拯救了系统","the_new_excerpt":"据Interactive Brokers的CEO&董事长表示，如果交\n如果不被阻止，它肯定会让系统崩溃，正如我们所怀疑的那样。\n但事实上，\"系统 \"只是他们拥有数万亿美元的资金，而所有的\n这场 \"崩盘 \"会做的，是把财富转移到其他人身上... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GameStop幾乎拯救了系統","the_new_excerpt":"據Interactive Brokers的CEO&董事長表示，如果交\n如果不被阻止，它肯定會讓系統崩潰，正如我們所懷疑的那樣。\n但事實上，\"系統 \"只是他們擁有數萬億美元的資金，而所有的\n這場 \"崩盤 \"會做的，是把財富轉移到其他人身上... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-24b34c5d-a824-55d7-b866-350f9fce8363","excerpt":"I felt this post was necessary due to all the people asking about due diligence.\nThese are things to look at\n\n\n\nBelow is my Guide on HOW TO ANALYZE & RESEARCH A STOCK, and what you should look\nat when evaluating a stock (This is my checklist just build from years of wins &\nlosses, things I learned…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lmha8g/must_know_essential_tips_on_how_to_research/","title":"MUST KNOW: ESSENTIAL Tips on how to Research, Analyze & Perform Due Diligence on Stocks [What to look at]","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 18, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"必须知道。如何研究、分析和执行股票尽职调查的基本技巧[看什么]","the_new_excerpt":"由于大家都在问尽职调查的问题，我觉得这个帖子很有必要。\n这些都是需要注意的事情\n\n\n\n以下是我关于如何分析和研究一只股票的指南，以及你应该注意的问题\n在评估股票时（这是我的检查表，只是建立从多年的胜利和。\n损失，我学到的东西...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"必須知道。如何研究、分析和執行股票盡職調查的基本技巧[看什麼]","the_new_excerpt":"由於大家都在問盡職調查的問題，我覺得這個帖子很有必要。\n這些都是需要注意的事情\n\n\n\n以下是我關於如何分析和研究一隻股票的指南，以及你應該注意的問題\n在評估股票時（這是我的檢查表，只是建立從多年的勝利和。\n損失，我學到的東西...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-73173e5a-921f-57cd-8948-cbb4b91b1133","previousId":"RedditPost-3b0e2731-4ea8-5183-aadd-81f958edca77","nextId":"RedditPost-24b34c5d-a824-55d7-b866-350f9fce8363","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lm4ob7/charles_schwab_schw_about_to_explode/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
