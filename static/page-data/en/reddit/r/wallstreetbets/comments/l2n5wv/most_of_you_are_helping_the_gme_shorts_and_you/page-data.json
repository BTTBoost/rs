GME TO THE MOON!!!!!!! KEEP STARVING THOSE SHORTS!*** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do you remember when you bought that first used car off your friend, only to find out that you couldn&#39;t actually <strong>use</strong> the car, because he was actually renting it out to his buddies?</p>\n\n<p>Of course your fucking don&#39;t, that would be fucking ridiculous. A 5 year-old understands property rights well enough to know this would be beyond stupid.</p>\n\n<p>AND YET, this is exactly what your broker is doing to you when you hold shares in your account. Brokers make TONS of money by <em>loaning your shares to people who want to SHORT your stock</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This is transparent to you as the stock holder. It all happens behind the scenes. Your broker is providing liquidity to shorts courtesy of YOU, which helps the shorts keep down the price of the stock you&#39;re holding. If you sell the shares, they gets yours back (or find them elsewhere) to close out your position, all without you being any the wiser than your own assets are being rented out under your nose to the benefit of your broker and of speculators who are taking the opposite side of the trade.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to maximize the odds of a real short squeeze and <strong>🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</strong>ing to the moon, you should stop playing into the hands of the shorts and OPT OUT of your broker&#39;s share lending program. Unfortunately, not all brokers allow this. If yours does not, you might be able to bargain with them or worst-case move to a broker that allows opt-out. This is one of the hidden costs of some (but not all) of the low-cost brokers out there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Your broker lends your shares to shorts which helps drive down prices. You should opt-out of this with your broker, or consider switching brokers to one that allows opt-out and enjoy the ensuing 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every broker has a different marketing name for their share lending program (usually some positive-spun euphemism). <strong><em>Post the name of your broker and the name of their share-lending program</em></strong> (if they have one), and I&#39;ll add it to the table here to help others:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>---Broker---</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>---Share-lending program name---</em></th>\n<th align=\"left\"><em>---Notes---</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Ally Invest</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Securities Income Program</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"/u/Swimming-Document152\">/u/Swimming-Document152</a> reports that share loans requires an opt-in form and is disabled by default.

As I understand, they are only allowed to loan your shares in a Margin account. (At least in the US, I don&#39;t know about regs in other countries)</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT2: HOLY SHIT GUYS, IT&#39;S WORKING! $GME PASSING 50 AS WE SPEAK!!!</strong> <strong>🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2n5wv/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/","title":"Most of you are helping the GME shorts and you don't even know it","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-22T19:33:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-22 19:33","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"95020418-0108-5097-a6bb-466cffc34011","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2n5wv/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2n5wv/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/I6yJzGv10eopvh8E6DZ5h94GLgQZLxcTarmgSzW65uM.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9a1ff9b3255de0710b59e4ceeb43365b9e4ff172","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"CalamariAce","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/CalamariAce","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"CalamariAce","score":3872,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你们大多数人都在帮助GME短线，而你们却不知道","the_new_excerpt":"编辑：***OMG你们这些神奇的作者，它的工作!!!!。GME TO THE MOON!!!!!!! 保持\n饿了那些短裤！****\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n你还记得你从朋友那里买下第一辆二手车的时候吗？\n发现你其实不能用... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們大多數人都在幫助GME短線，而你們卻不知道","the_new_excerpt":"編輯：***OMG你們這些神奇的作者，它的工作!!!!。GME TO THE MOON!!!!!!! 保持\n餓了那些短褲！****\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n你還記得你從朋友那裏買下第一輛二手車的時候嗎？\n發現你其實不能用... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-421be037-c649-58c7-b0d7-a6690fc577c0","excerpt":"Hello investors of reddit.\n\nI know in today’s market we are seeing companies breaking their all time price\nrecords day in and day out, companies being traded at p/e and p/b ratios that\nwould give Benjamin graham and warren Buffett heart attacks.
