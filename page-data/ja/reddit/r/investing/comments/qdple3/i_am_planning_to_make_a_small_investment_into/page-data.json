Constructive criticism, please. Let&#39;s get to it.</p>\n\n<p>The opportunity here is to capitalize on the limited amount of IPv4 addresses in open circulation. The risk is that IPv6 adoption will occur sufficiently prior to any price increase and will result in loss of demand in IPv4.  Put differently, this is a bet that companies which are unwilling, or unable, to fully adopt IPv6 will pay a significant premium to continue doing business using their current tech.</p>\n\n<p>The price of IPv4 addresses has risen from ~$8/ea in 2014 to $50/ea in 2021 (<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/EqW5jKn.png\">1.</a>)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One concern here is that price growth was flat in 2019 before it started growing sharply in 2020. This might be indicative of a short-term bubble due to unexpected increased demand in remote needs.</li>\n<li>This is a relatively high-volume market. There are tens of millions in transactions occurring weekly. (<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/nbMvpKZ.png\">2.</a>)</li>\n<li>You must hold purchases for two years before they are able to be resold. (<a href=\"https://ipv4marketgroup.com/arin34/\">3.</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>IPv6 adoption has grown from 3% to 38% from 2014 to 2021. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/ItptmoP.png\">(4.)</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This represents 5% growth per year. 10 years from now would be 88%.</li>\n<li>Adoption growth is linear and <em>slowing</em> - adoption has not quickened in response to the IPv4 price hike. Growth was exponential in 2014 and slowed to linear.</li>\n<li>Adoption has been far slower than anticipated. &quot;On 7 March 2013, the Internet Engineering Task Force created a working group for IPv4 sunset ... in May 2018 this working group was closed as no immediate work could be identified due to the slow transition to IPv6.&quot; (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_deployment#Coexistence_with_IPv4\">5.</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think this is a good play for me personally because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I work in tech and feel I understand the needs of tech decently well.</li>\n<li>I am looking for a &#39;collectible&#39; asset for part of my portfolio. I see IPv4 addresses as something similar to investing in M:TG cards, for example. I want to hold slightly less cash without investing more into stocks or cryptocurrency.</li>\n<li>I do not have any reservations about holding for half a decade. This is a small amount of money (~5% of portfolio) and have absolutely no intent of selling within two years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I was also able to find:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://fly.io/blog/32-bit-real-estate/\">https://fly.io/blog/32-bit-real-estate/</a> A YCombinator startup highlighting their frustrations with the IPv4 market</li>\n<li>Someone asking about on <a href=\"/r/stocks\">r/stocks</a> a year ago with a slightly negative response <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jf8nsx/investing_into_ipv4_adresses/\">https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jf8nsx/investing_into_ipv4_adresses/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thoughts?
