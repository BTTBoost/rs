My 36 hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out, I will never YOLO on a bubble ever again.</p>\n\n<p>The principle seemed straightforward: hedge funds got lazy/greedy, over-shorted their positions, bet against a company that wasn&#39;t actually going under, and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze. Even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market, the basic premise makes sense. But the devil&#39;s in the details, and hype is blinding.</p>\n\n<p>First red flag was when I realized <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/\">/u/DeepFuckingValue</a> did not bet on the short squeeze, he bet on undervalued stock price <em>over a year ago</em>. He has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze, he walks away with 8 figures. So the people screaming &quot;if he&#39;s still in, I&#39;m still in!&quot; and &quot;look at those brass balls, if he can lose $5MM in a day then I can hold&quot; are really living up to the dumb ape meme. He didn&#39;t lose $5MM yesterday, he lost $5MM in *unrealized gains*, there is a *huge* difference.</p>\n\n<p>Second red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds won&#39;t go down without a fight, and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience. You don&#39;t get that without learning how to game the system in complex, subtle ways. So even if they are still heavily shorted (which they might not even be anymore), and even if somehow <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/\">r/WSB</a> is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them, that doesn&#39;t rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about.</p>\n\n<p>But even in the off chance that somehow this turns around, and $GME does go &quot;to the moon,&quot; that doesn&#39;t change the fact that it&#39;s bad long-term strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons. They almost certainly fail, and if they don&#39;t, they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble. I&#39;m still holding my shares but I don&#39;t expect to see my ~$1200 ever again. In the off chance I break even or see a profit here, I will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lazcak/what_gme_has_taught_me_in_36_hours_of_day_trading/","title":"What $GME has taught me in 36 hours of day trading","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-02T17:19:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-02 17:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d6df2203-fc0c-519b-8723-14f4d5297156","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lazcak/what_gme_has_taught_me_in_36_hours_of_day_trading/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lazcak/what_gme_has_taught_me_in_36_hours_of_day_trading/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"austindcc","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/austindcc","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"austindcc","score":26213,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"36小时的日间交易中，$GME教会了我什么？","the_new_excerpt":"上周五跳上$GME的行列，4日@约316。我的36小时日间交易已经\n已经教会了我，无论这一切如何发展，我永远不会YOLO上的\n泡沫再一次。\n\n原理似乎很直接：对冲基金懒惰/贪婪了，过度超跌了。\n他们的立场，对赌公司，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"36小時的日間交易中，$GME教會了我什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"上週五跳上$GME的行列，4日@約316。我的36小時日間交易已經\n已經教會了我，無論這一切如何發展，我永遠不會YOLO上的\n泡沫再一次。\n\n原理似乎很直接：對沖基金懶惰/貪婪了，過度超跌了。\n他們的立場，對賭公司，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b11e4311-e29a-531b-816c-1cab1cae1642","excerpt":"Welcome, please discuss GME here!
