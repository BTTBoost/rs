Who <em>had</em> around $13bn in assets. From them\nreporting being down over 30% as of Fri 22-1 in the month <em>overall</em> we can\ndeduce that at the time they had a $3.7bn loss. The stock price on the day\nbefore was $43.03.</p>\n\n<p>When the price rallied to the $70s on Fri-21 they were shitting their pants b/c\nthey were now showing nearly a $6.5bn loss. They called up their buddies\nCitadel and Point72 and got $5bn in loans, convinced their brokerage they could\nget out of it (to not get liquidated) and started <em>trying</em> to illegally\nmanipulate the market. It didn&#39;t work; you retards and whales held. And kept\nbuying.</p>\n\n<p>As of EOD 1-26 the stock price closed at $150, then to $240 after market. </p>\n\n<p>Melvin now has as a $13bn loss. This kills the Melvin.</p>\n\n<p>These short positions are now parasitic fuck bombs that will literally\n<em>consume</em> anyone who is holding it when the dust clears. </p>\n\n<p>Melvin&#39;s brokerages will be liquidating their assets ASAP less <em>they</em> get stuck\nwith them. But here&#39;s the fun part...  No one&#39;s selling b/c of you degenerates.\nBut, alas, there&#39;s a solution. There are funds like Blackrock who specialize in\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_lending\">Security Lending</a> (see\n<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf\">securities-lending-viewed-through-the-sustainability-lens.pdf</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a typical securities lending transaction, an asset owner lends securities\n — both stocks and bonds\n— to a third party, often one who needs to cover a short position. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>cover. a. short. position</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out, Blackguard owns 13.2% of GME — 11,271,702 shares. And they just\nsold 2,054,367 shares to bail someone out for over $400mill. How do we know?\nBecause of <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000083423721001340/us36467w1099_012621.txt\">this SEC\ndocument</a>\nfiled <em>today</em> (also see <a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/blackrock\">fintel</a>). </p>\n\n<p>And what happened at EOD today? Price exploded to $240 for a moment as these\ngot bought. Lines up. This is the smoking gun to signal the action.</p>\n\n<p>At conservative estimates there are at <em>least</em> 50,000,000 short positions yet to cover.\nBlackrock is their last life line and will only hold out for so long. Once\nBlackrock goes it&#39;s a fucking free for all. All the shorts who have yet to\ncover are fucked. Completely fucked.</p>\n\n<p>At $200, 50,000,000 shares is $10bn. But $10bn is literally GME&#39;s market cap.\nTo get rid of $10bn in GME shorts they&#39;ll be at least doubling the price/market\ncap, so by the second that $10bn loss is going to be grow, and grow. Doubling,\ntripling, quadrupling even.</p>\n\n<p>This is their armageddon. That single $GME short position could completely wipe\nthem out. That position is a wildfire in their portfolio that can only be\nextinguished with <em>money</em>.</p>\n\n<p>$1,000? That&#39;s a fucking <em>joke</em>. They will be <em>scrambling</em> to cover, constantly out bidding each other on orders.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>This could be hitting over $5,000 or more</strong></h1>\n\n<p>I am not fucking kidding. The higher we hold, the higher it goes until the last one\nis standing with the -99.999999999999%.</p>\n\n<p>And you wanna know the extra fucking wild thing?</p>\n\n<p>Meta.</p>\n\n<p>Every Brad, Chad, and Susan at BIG HEDGE X Inc that shorted GME are <em>awake</em>.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>They are reading this</strong></h1>\n\n<p>They are scouring and scrutinizing every indicator, every sentiment, every\n<em>post on WSB</em> they can to decide on what to do. When they see this post?</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>... It&#39;s on.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<h1>When will it start?</h1>\n\n<p>Soon.</p>\n\n<h1>How long it will take?</h1>\n\n<p>Who knows. </p>\n\n<h1>How long it will last?</h1>\n\n<p>Who knows. </p>\n\n<h1>How long it will go?</h1>\n\n<p>Who knows.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<h1>Just set your limits accordingly (don&#39;t sell to early)</h1>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>DISCLAIMER: This is not investment, legal, or financial advise.
