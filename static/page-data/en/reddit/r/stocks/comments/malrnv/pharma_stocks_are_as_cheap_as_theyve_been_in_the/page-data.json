Many pharmaceutical stocks are trading with a forward PE ratio ranging from 12 to 7,5. Abbvie has a forward PE of 7,5, Merck is at 11,5, Bristol Myers Squibb at 8, Novartis as well is trading at 12 forward PE. They all boast a 3-4% dividend yield and EPS growth forecasted between 7-10%. I do not see many downsides in investing in these companies, beside some patents expiration down the line. Despite the great cash flow and valuations this sector seems to be lagging. Why do you think it is so? In such an expensive market to see a company like Merck trade at 11 forward PE seems too good to be true, and I&#39;d like to hear your opinion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/malrnv/pharma_stocks_are_as_cheap_as_theyve_been_in_the/","title":"Pharma stocks are as cheap as they've been in the past 20 years.
