Market participants continue to anxiously wait for any developments out of Washington DC and monitor the Treasury yield. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is set to record it’s first negative month all year. September, on average, is historically the worst month for equities.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, technology stocks have been under pressure given the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has spiked to the hover around the highest levels since June. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today&#39;s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections. As of writing, the yield is 1.52%</p>\n\n<p>Timothy Chubb, Chief Investment Officer at advisory firm Girard, said “Yesterday’s selloff was really largely driven by rate movement. It wasn’t necessarily the size of the rate movement, but the speed that it took place.” The yield gained more than 16 basis points from its low last Friday to Monday’s peak of 1.56%. </p>\n\n<p>Paul Schatz, President of Heritage Capital, said “This [the recent dip] feels a lot worse than it actually is because we haven’t had much volatility since last October, last September. But remember, all the reasons why we’re going down — nothing is new. You’ve got the debt ceiling and the government shutdown and Evergrande and inflation. All known things. None of these are going to befall the bull market or cause a recession. There’s always some kind of short-term thing the market focuses on to get a pullback going. We’ve got it. I think it’s one you buy with both hands in the next week or so, and I think we’re going strongly to new highs in Q4.”</p>\n\n<p>Congressional lawmakers continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent a shutdown and raise the debt ceiling in order to save the US government from defaulting on its debts. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that Congress must raise the debt limit by October 18 in order to avoid a default. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary. This is a situation to monitor today. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-government-funding-e7bfe8a6ffdb40a8d33e17ef11ded7a7\">https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-government-funding-e7bfe8a6ffdb40a8d33e17ef11ded7a7</a></p>\n\n<p>Jason Grumet, Bipartisan Policy Center President, said “It is really important that we separate the shutdown, which is terrible, from the debt limit, which is catastrophic. There could be, I think, a very short shutdown of the government Friday night going into Saturday, Sunday. And I think that you would then see a short continuing resolution to get the government running again. The government shutdown really isn’t the problem we’re grappling with. The problem we&#39;re grappling with really is the debt ceiling. Democrats tried to join them together. That did not make the sale for Republicans. Some Democrats have a different approach to the debt ceiling. But I am not particularly concerned about a government shutdown.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>The Weekly Unemployment Report showed an unexpected rise in first-time jobless claims last week, even as companies across industries look to hire workers to make up for labor shortfalls and the first rise in jobless claims in months.
