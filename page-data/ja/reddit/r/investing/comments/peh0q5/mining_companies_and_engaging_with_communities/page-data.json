Mining activities can affect the environment and the communities in these mining sites, so I think mining companies should also prioritize projects that will promote responsible mining and inclusion of the local communities.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Newmont Corporation (NEM) has sustainability programs that involve environmental and social responsibility. The company has environmental standards that are designed to protect the environment and prevent or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate the impacts of their mining activities in the mining sites’ locations. They also involve the local communities, providing jobs and provisioning local goods and services, which makes them become an important player in catalyzing the economic development and social well-being of host governments and communities. They also have the <a href=\"https://www.newmont.com/IndigenousCommunityRelations/default.aspx\">Global Center for Indigenous Community Relations</a>, whose role is to “to advocate for excellence in engagement with Indigenous Peoples, both within Newmont and across the industry.”</p>\n\n<p>With junior companies, Solaris Resources (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=TSE:+SLS&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDbPiiyvjK03SeBaxcoQEu1opBPsEAwAqUS8YSAAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMuov1vNHyAhXbAogKHZriDHMQsRUwIHoECDYQAw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=609\">SLS</a>) has remarkable projects focusing on these matters. The company is very inclusive when it comes to the local miners in the community, and hired a lot of them, generating jobs for people. They also put a priority on using locally sourced products and services whenever practical, to benefit the regional economy. Also, the company has an environmental management project with the goal of minimizing the impact of mining on the environment. This is also more possible since the current president of Ecuador vowed to emphasize the enforcement of environmental protection rules and larger involvement from indigenous communities in deciding the future of mining projects.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow, a lot of corporations feel less responsible for the damage they cause to the environment and to communities with their projects, so I think it should be the responsibility of these companies to change and be more inclusive and responsible. All these globalization and the current climate of economic rationalism is making these people less human and deprived of compassion and sense of responsibility.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/peh0q5/mining_companies_and_engaging_with_communities/","title":"Mining companies and engaging with communities and environmental advocacies","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-30T14:16:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-30 14:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1f081131-fbca-5779-af7a-1feed16b27c8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/peh0q5/mining_companies_and_engaging_with_communities/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/peh0q5/mining_companies_and_engaging_with_communities/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"JonDyna965","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JonDyna965","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"JonDyna965","score":297,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"鉱山会社と地域社会・環境保護団体との関わり","the_new_excerpt":"世界各地には多くの鉱山会社の採掘場があります。\n世界各地にあります。採掘活動は、環境や地域社会に影響を与える可能性があります。\n採掘活動は環境や地域社会に影響を与える可能性があります。\n鉱山会社は、責任ある採掘と地域社会への貢献を促進するプロジェクトを優先すべきだと思います...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"矿业公司与社区和环境倡导者的接触","the_new_excerpt":"大批采矿公司的许多矿区位于世界各地。\n的很多矿区。采矿活动会影响到这些矿区的环境和社区\n因此，我认为矿业公司也应该优先考虑那些能够促进负责任的采矿和孵化的项目。\n因此，我认为采矿公司也应该优先考虑那些能够促进负责任的采矿和包容社区的项目。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"礦業公司與社區和環境倡導者的接觸","the_new_excerpt":"大批採礦公司的許多礦區位於世界各地。\n的很多礦區。採礦活動會影響到這些礦區的環境和社區\n因此，我認爲礦業公司也應該優先考慮那些能夠促進負責任的採礦和孵化的項目。\n因此，我認爲採礦公司也應該優先考慮那些能夠促進負責任的採礦和包容社區的項目。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8deae403-d762-5d56-bec9-c7738504e610","excerpt":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/30/china-cuts-amount-of-time-minors-can-spend-playing-video-games\n\nChinese regulators on Monday slashed the amount of time players under the age of\n18 can spend on online games to an hour of gameplay on Fridays, weekends and\nholidays, in response to growing…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/peh5er/more_crackdown_by_the_ccp_on_video_games_minors/","title":"More crackdown by the CCP on video games, minors can only play 1 hr on Fridays, weekends and holidays.
