However, I still want to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For y’all degenerates, just skip those next paragraphs and go straight to the picks. For y’all nerds who want to understand a thing or two about my program, keep on reading.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we’re not talking about the over discussed stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We’re talking about the next ones.</li>\n<li>I’ve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool’s insights.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here’s how to interpret the stock picks.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn’t be considered an “emerging stock” based on my model).</li>\n<li>The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enough said, here’s the (small) list!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%</strong></p>\n\n<p>Market Cap: $6.5bn</p>\n\n<p>Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.</p>\n\n<p>Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Magna International (MGA) +436%</strong></p>\n\n<p>Market Cap: $22.7bn</p>\n\n<p>Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.</p>\n\n<p>Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple’s new car.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.</p>\n\n<p>If y&#39;all find these insights useful, please let me know and I’ll keep sharing them here on a weekly basis :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuo4zg/i_built_a_program_that_detects_buzzing_stocks_on/","title":"I built a program that detects buzzing stocks on Reddit and Twitter","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-11T07:00:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-11 07:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8ea49233-798d-570e-b759-e2f50958d7e5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuo4zg/i_built_a_program_that_detects_buzzing_stocks_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuo4zg/i_built_a_program_that_detects_buzzing_stocks_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"lucacha","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lucacha","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lucacha","score":1776,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我做了一个程序来检测Reddit和推特上嗡嗡作响的股票","the_new_excerpt":"作为一个糟糕的投资者但优秀的开发人员(至少我喜欢这么认为)，我构建了一个程序\n在Python上，在Reddit和推特上发现了新兴的股票，这样你们就可以\n甜美柔情🚀\n\n到目前为止，大多数精选都是小写的，所以我不能在这里发布它们\n根据潜艇的规则。然而，我仍然…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我做了一個程序來檢測Reddit和推特上嗡嗡作響的股票","the_new_excerpt":"作爲一個糟糕的投資者但優秀的開發人員(至少我喜歡這麼認爲)，我構建了一個程序\n在Python上，在Reddit和推特上發現了新興的股票，這樣你們就可以\n甜美柔情🚀\n\n到目前爲止，大多數精選都是小寫的，所以我不能在這裏發佈它們\n根據潛艇的規則。然而，我仍然…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2ccf24ae-cfca-5087-87ae-99a45b3f0049","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kun1f9/tesla_premarket/","title":"Tesla Premarket","date":"January 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"特斯拉上市前","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉上市前","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2cd80599-f6a6-53f0-9c9a-84264faedec0","excerpt":"Hyundai Motor and Apple Inc plan to sign a partnership deal on autonomous\nelectric cars by March and start production around 2024 in the United States.\n\nThe report follows a statement on Friday from Hyundai Motor that it was in early\ntalks with Apple after another local media outlet said the…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kuqssm/apple_and_hyundai_motor_plan_to_sign_an_ev/","title":"Apple and Hyundai Motor plan to sign an EV partnership deal","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 11, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"苹果和现代汽车计划签署电动汽车合作协议","the_new_excerpt":"现代汽车和苹果公司计划签署自动驾驶合作协议\n电动汽车将于明年3月之前在美国开始生产，并于2024年左右开始生产。\n\n在这份报告发布之前，现代汽车(Hyundai Motor)周五发表声明称，它正处于早期\n在另一家当地媒体表示…与苹果谈判后","locale":"zh"},{"title":"蘋果和現代汽車計劃簽署電動汽車合作協議","the_new_excerpt":"現代汽車和蘋果公司計劃簽署自動駕駛合作協議\n電動汽車將於明年3月之前在美國開始生產，並於2024年左右開始生產。\n\n在這份報告發布之前，現代汽車(Hyundai Motor)週五發表聲明稱，它正處於早期\n在另一家當地媒體表示…與蘋果談判後","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-8ea49233-798d-570e-b759-e2f50958d7e5","previousId":"RedditPost-2ccf24ae-cfca-5087-87ae-99a45b3f0049","nextId":"RedditPost-2cd80599-f6a6-53f0-9c9a-84264faedec0","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuo4zg/i_built_a_program_that_detects_buzzing_stocks_on/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
