He claims that economy has entered a new cycle, which is expected to continue for years, not months. I know this is not new,  and there are multiple other resources that share this belief. What was interesting to me about this podcast was that although the rise in the markets is high, it is exactly what happened in the beginning of the last cycle.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking back to the prior economic cycle, it&#39;s interesting to note that the S&amp;P 500 is tracking almost exactly what it did coming out of that recession, up about 80% over 10 months. Back then, the S&amp;P 500 then entered a long consolidation, during which it made little progress over the next eight months before resuming higher. While past is not always prologue, it can be a good guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>So what do you think? Is this a beginning of a new economic cycle and are we about to enter a consolidation phase, while we wait for the profits of the companies to catch up with the stock markets expectations and normalize to a lower P/E ratio?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l9icsk/a_new_economic_cycle/","title":"A New Economic Cycle","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T11:32:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 11:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1c9e9111-3fe4-50f6-845a-b99f6fe36162","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l9icsk/a_new_economic_cycle/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l9icsk/a_new_economic_cycle/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ace66","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ace66","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ace66","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"新经济周期","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我听了一个短播节目\n[https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/thoughts-on-the-market-wilson] 来自Mike\n摩根士丹利的首席投资官威尔逊。他称，经济\n已进入新的周期，预计将持续数年而非数月。I\n这不是什么新鲜事，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新經濟週期","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我聽了一個短播節目\n[https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/thoughts-on-the-market-wilson] 來自Mike\n摩根士丹利的首席投資官威爾遜。他稱，經濟\n已進入新的週期，預計將持續數年而非數月。I\n這不是什麼新鮮事，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a74c3cde-57fe-56c0-a24b-842cd1c7f519","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sow3/amc_to_pluto/","title":"AMC TO PLUTO 🚀🚀🚀","date":"February 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AMC TO PLUTO 🚀🚀🚀🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC TO PLUTO 🚀🚀🚀🚀。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-96f91d66-54e5-5b00-94ad-32b2c983dfbf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9x7yh/an_incredible_gme_poster_made_by_ubirdisonbird/","title":"An incredible GME poster made by u/BirdisonBird","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 01, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"u/BirdisonBird制作的GME海报，令人难以置信。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"u/BirdisonBird製作的GME海報，令人難以置信。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-1c9e9111-3fe4-50f6-845a-b99f6fe36162","previousId":"RedditPost-a74c3cde-57fe-56c0-a24b-842cd1c7f519","nextId":"RedditPost-96f91d66-54e5-5b00-94ad-32b2c983dfbf","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l9icsk/a_new_economic_cycle/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
