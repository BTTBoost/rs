The platform remained offline during some of the highest volume trading days amid the fastest bear market in history.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Robinhood also faced criticism over the death of a 20-year old trader who killed himself after believing he racked up huge losses on Robinhood. The suicide was mentioned in the FINRA press release.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Robinhood neither admitted or denied the charges.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>“Robinhood has invested heavily in improving platform stability, enhancing our educational resources, and building out our customer support and legal and compliance teams,” Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay, head of public policy communications for Robinhood, said in response to the fine. “We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all.”</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Robinhood said it now has approximately 2,700 customer support staff, according to a blog post. That is more than triple the staff it had during March 2020.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The Menlo Park, California-based company forecasted this fine was coming and set aside $26.6 million for settlements, according to an annual audit filing with the SEC. However, the fine is more than double the amount reserved.  </p>\n\n<p>“The fine imposed in this matter, the highest ever levied by FINRA, reflects the scope and seriousness of Robinhood’s violations, including FINRA’s finding that Robinhood communicated false and misleading information to millions of its customers,” said Jessica Hopper, executive vice president and head of FINRA’s Department of Enforcement.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>FINRA also fined Robinhood $1.25 million in 2019 for best execution violations.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Robinhood is expected to go public in the coming months with a valuation north of $30 billion</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/robinhood-pay-70m-false-information-trading-outages-largest-ever-regulatory-n1272722\">NBC News</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ob2ayy/robinhood_to_pay_70m_for_false_information_and/","title":"Robinhood to pay $70M for false information and trading outages, in largest-ever regulatory fine","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-30T18:32:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-30 18:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dd3d4831-b426-54cf-929c-82c117057eb2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ob2ayy/robinhood_to_pay_70m_for_false_information_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ob2ayy/robinhood_to_pay_70m_for_false_information_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":2154,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロビンフッド、過去最大の規制当局による罰金で、虚偽の情報と取引停止に対して7000万ドルを支払う","the_new_excerpt":"> この問題で課された罰金は、RobinhoodがFINRAと連絡を取っていたことを含む、Robinhoodの違反の範囲と深刻さを反映しています。\n> この問題で課された罰金は、Robinhoodが何百万人もの顧客に虚偽の誤解を招くような情報を\n> 虚偽の誤解を招くような情報を何百万人もの顧客に伝えたというFINRAの認定を含む、違反の範囲と深刻さを反映しています。\n> と述べています。\n> \n> オンライン取引プラットフォームのRobinhoodは、約70ドルを支払うことになりました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Robinhood因虚假信息和交易中断支付7000万美元，这是有史以来最大的监管罚款","the_new_excerpt":"> \"在这个问题上的罚款反映了Robinhood的违法行为的范围和严重性。\n> Robinhood的违规行为的范围和严重性，包括美国金融监管局发现Robinhood向其数百万客户传达了\n> 向数百万客户提供虚假和误导性信息，\"监管机构说。\n> 说。\n> \n> 网上交易平台Robinhood将支付大约70美元。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood因虛假信息和交易中斷支付7000萬美元，這是有史以來最大的監管罰款","the_new_excerpt":"> \"在這個問題上的罰款反映了Robinhood的違法行爲的範圍和嚴重性。\n> Robinhood的違規行爲的範圍和嚴重性，包括美國金融監管局發現Robinhood向其數百萬客戶傳達了\n> 向數百萬客戶提供虛假和誤導性信息，\"監管機構說。\n> 說。\n> \n> 網上交易平臺Robinhood將支付大約70美元。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ebd8a6e6-cf48-5348-a1ba-a03550c32a51","excerpt":"I’ve noticed that recently these two stocks becoming more popular discussion\npoints, with NVDA having a 4 to 1 split in mid July and AMD’s projected growth.\nI’m curious to know which of the two you guying are liking better and what your\npoints are for your favored stock?","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oaxcj2/amd_vs_nvda_which_one_are_you_guys_favoring_right/","title":"AMD vs NVDA, which one are you guys favoring right now?","date":"June 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AMDとNVDA、皆さんは今どちらを支持していますか？","the_new_excerpt":"最近、この2つの銘柄が話題になっていることに気がつきました。\nNVDAは7月中旬に4対1の分割を行い、AMDは成長が見込まれています。\nこの2つの銘柄のどちらが好きなのか、また好きな銘柄のポイントは何なのか知りたいです。\nまた、あなたのお気に入りの銘柄のポイントは何ですか？","locale":"ja"},{"title":"AMD对NVDA，你们现在倾向于哪一个？","the_new_excerpt":"我注意到，最近这两只股票成为更受欢迎的讨论点。\n点，NVDA在7月中旬进行了4比1的拆分，而AMD的预期增长。\n我很想知道你们对这两只股票中的哪只更喜欢，你们对自己喜欢的股票有什么看法？\n你喜欢的股票的要点是什么？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMD對NVDA，你們現在傾向於哪一個？","the_new_excerpt":"我注意到，最近這兩隻股票成爲更受歡迎的討論點。\n點，NVDA在7月中旬進行了4比1的拆分，而AMD的預期增長。\n我很想知道你們對這兩隻股票中的哪隻更喜歡，你們對自己喜歡的股票有什麼看法？\n你喜歡的股票的要點是什麼？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-88989738-a257-5269-96b4-a849be79c972","excerpt":"PREPARATION FOR TRADING DAY -
