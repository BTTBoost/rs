(Nasdaq: OKTA), the leading independent identity provider, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended July 31, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;In our first quarter as a combined company with Auth0, we&#39;re off to a fantastic start,&quot; said Todd McKinnon, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Okta. &quot;Execution remained sharp with strong demand for Okta&#39;s workforce and customer identity solutions, as well as Auth0&#39;s developer-centric identity solutions. As organizations advance on their journey of improving their customers&#39; digital experience, adopting zero-trust security environments, and deploying more cloud applications, they continue to turn to Okta to deliver an unmatched array of modern identity solutions to meet these challenges.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Financial Highlights:</p>\n\n<p>Revenue: Total revenue was $316 million, an increase of 57% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $303 million, an increase of 59% year-over-year. On an Okta standalone basis (excluding $38 million attributable to Auth0), total revenue grew 39%.</p>\n\n<p>Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO): RPO, or subscription backlog, was $2.24 billion, an increase of 57% year-over-year. Current RPO, which is contracted subscription revenue expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, was $1.10 billion, up 60% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. On an Okta standalone basis (excluding Auth0), RPO and current RPO increased 42% and 43% year-over-year, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Calculated Billings: Total calculated billings, net of acquired deferred revenue, was $362 million, an increase of 83% year-over-year. Calculated billings includes the effect of billings process improvements that were enacted at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Excluding these changes, calculated billings would have been $345 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year. On an Okta standalone basis, excluding Auth0 and the effect of the billings process improvements, calculated billings increased 47% year-over-year.</p>\n\n<p>GAAP Operating Loss: GAAP operating loss was $263 million, or 83% of total revenue, compared to a GAAP operating loss of $45 million, or 23% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Non-GAAP Operating Income/Loss: Non-GAAP operating loss was $25 million, or 8% of total revenue, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $6 million, or 3% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.</p>\n\n<p>GAAP Net Loss: GAAP net loss was $277 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of $60 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. GAAP net loss per share was $1.83, compared to a GAAP net loss per share of $0.48 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. GAAP net loss and GAAP net loss per share include $150 million and $0.99, respectively, attributable to Auth0.</p>\n\n<p>Non-GAAP Net Income/Loss: Non-GAAP net loss was $16 million, compared to non-GAAP net income of $10 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.11, compared to non-GAAP basic net income per share of $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.07 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Cash Flow: Net cash used in operations was $3 million, or (1)% of total revenue, compared to net cash provided by operations of $11 million, or 5% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Free cash flow was negative $4 million, or (1)% of total revenue, compared to $7 million, or 3% of total revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $2.47 billion at July 31, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>The section titled &quot;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&quot; below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.</p>\n\n<p>Financial Outlook:</p>\n\n<p>Okta&#39;s financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:</p>\n\n<p>Total revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;</p>\n\n<p>Non-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and</p>\n\n<p>Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.</p>\n\n<p>For the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:</p>\n\n<p>Total revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;</p>\n\n<p>Non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and</p>\n\n<p>Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.</p>\n\n<p>These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.</p>\n\n<p>Okta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.</p>\n\n<p>Conference Call Information:</p>\n\n<p>Okta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.</p>\n\n<p>Supplemental Financial and Other Information:</p>\n\n<p>Supplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.</p>\n\n<p>Non-GAAP Financial Measures:</p>\n\n<p>This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.</p>\n\n<p>Okta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.</p>\n\n<p>The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company&#39;s management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.</p>\n\n<p>Okta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pg26gz/okta_announces_strong_second_quarter_results/","title":"Okta Announces Strong Second Quarter Results","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-02T06:53:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-02 06:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pg26gz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pg26gz/okta_announces_strong_second_quarter_results/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pg26gz/okta_announces_strong_second_quarter_results/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"PascalSiakim","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PascalSiakim","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PascalSiakim","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Okta社、好調な第2四半期業績を発表","the_new_excerpt":"[本文](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/okta-announces-strong-second-quarter-200100388.html)\n\nサンフランシスコ、2021年9月01日--Okta, Inc.
