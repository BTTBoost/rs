Key takeaway:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise.

The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Strong Financials</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fueled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Current and Future Potential</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs.
