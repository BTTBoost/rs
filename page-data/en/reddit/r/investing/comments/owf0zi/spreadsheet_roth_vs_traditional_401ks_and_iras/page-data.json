I did this because it&#39;s a recurring topic of confusion on the part of newbies (which is totally understandable) but also of debate among well-meaning people. </p>\n\n<p>One piece of traditional wisdom has been that it&#39;s largely a wash, relying on commutative arithmetic with tax rates and an often-uncommunicated assumption that  those rates won&#39;t change during the lifetime of the saver/retiree. Another is that one should use traditional accounts to improve tax efficiency anyway, and that the <em>rest</em> of it is a wash. As I hope the spreadsheet helps to make clear, these are (at least often) untrue, and the devil&#39;s in the details. </p>\n\n<p>I used the spreadsheet to test out some of my own ideas, which generally skew in favor of Roth accounts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Future tax rates may well be hiked, making Roth options far safer for guaranteed retirement income</p></li>\n<li><p>For lower earners, this makes extra sense because they&#39;re in very low tax brackets anyway to start with</p></li>\n<li><p>For higher earners, Roth should be the default option when maxing out because of the greater concentration of earnings in tax-advantaged accounts</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I expected to find that Roth was generally better at low and high ends of the earnings spectrum, but was surprised to find it generally better in the middle too. I&#39;m open to suggestions for improving the tool, and would enjoy discussion of the results. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Using the spreadsheet</strong></p>\n\n<p>The spreadsheet&#39;s intended to give a rough picture of how the account types perform, including when matched in different combinations. Some features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In general, the quickest way to see the effects of different choices is to change settings in the left panel or in the first year&#39;s row. Try setting different combinations such as age, starting income, etc. and view the results in the grey bolded subcolumn below.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most settings controlling contributions, earnings and withdrawals for a particular year can be changed in that year&#39;s row, which by default also alters following years for that column</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This allows modeling the effect of tax hikes, etc. as well as market disruptions (sequence of return risks)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>The contribution model of company-match-first, then max-IRA, then max-401k, then (optional) overflow-to-taxable-account is followed.</p></li>\n<li><p>To make comparisons fair, savings percentages are evaluated pre-tax, but Roth contributions to both 401ks and IRAs are tax-adjusted to take up more of the savings percentage, i.e. exhaust it earlier </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This means that to max out Roth contributions, you must set the savings percentage high enough</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Variable inflation rates are allowed, and one can calculate inflation-adjusted earnings as well as contribution limits</p></li>\n<li><p>Returns are shown in projected future un-adjusted as well as inflation-adjusted dollars </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Quirks and known issues</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There is no provision for state income taxes (this would be easy to add if helpful)</p></li>\n<li><p>There is no current support for including Social Security projected earnings in retirement income projections</p></li>\n<li><p>There is no direct support for rolling from a traditional to a Roth account (though one could mock this up by manually setting various dollar values for a particular year, with the caveat that this would disrupt auto-calculations for the edited cells). Instead, in rollover years traditional 401k contents are rolled to the traditional IRA, and Roth 401k contents are rolled to the Roth IRA. </p></li>\n<li><p>Modeling a glide path, and differential returns after retirement when the focus shifts to retaining wealth and generating stable income, is best done currently by manually adjusting settings on individual years</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/","title":"Spreadsheet: Roth vs. traditional 401ks and IRAs","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-02T15:25:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-02 15:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f142cc84-4b47-5ffe-bb71-3b9fb00c4533","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"jeff_varszegi","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jeff_varszegi","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jeff_varszegi","score":608,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"スプレッドシート。Roth vs. traditional 401ks and IRA","the_new_excerpt":"ロス型と伝統型の401kとIRAに投資した場合のリターンを計算するスプレッドシートを作ってみました。\nバージョンの401kとIRAに投資した場合のリターンを計算するスプレッドシートを作りました。\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4wKbUXdc8VA0mG4ri2wP9VuZCwae7b9MvA4u2HT7w/copy]をご覧ください。\nこれをやったのは、初心者の方がよく混乱するテーマだからです。\n(これは完全に...)","locale":"ja"},{"title":"电子表格。罗斯与传统401计划和IRA的比较","the_new_excerpt":"我做了一个电子表格来计算投资于罗斯和传统版本的回报。\n的回报。\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4wKbUXdc8VA0mG4ri2wP9VuZCwae7b9MvA4u2HT7w/copy]。\n我这样做是因为这是一个反复出现的新手困惑的话题\n(这完全是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"電子表格。羅斯與傳統401計劃和IRA的比較","the_new_excerpt":"我做了一個電子表格來計算投資於羅斯和傳統版本的回報。\n的回報。\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4wKbUXdc8VA0mG4ri2wP9VuZCwae7b9MvA4u2HT7w/copy]。\n我這樣做是因爲這是一個反覆出現的新手困惑的話題\n(這完全是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9f070e25-f48d-5e6e-b6d2-cc1e72a6f2df","excerpt":"I would like to invest on dividend stocks at some point in my life, so i would\nlike to know (as simple as possible) how do they work.
