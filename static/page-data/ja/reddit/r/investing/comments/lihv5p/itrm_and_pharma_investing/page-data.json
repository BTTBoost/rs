I got into $ITRM for about $500 a few days back without really knowing anything about it, a foolish move by a green investor. Only foolish because I bought it without knowing anything about the stock and just saw some conversation about it on stocktwits.</p>\n\n<p>Well, since then it has gone down, so I decided to learn about what it actually is and if I should be patient or cut my losses. I have learned some about FDA approval processes, offerings, urinary tract infections, and that drug companies can exist for some time hemorrhaging money without ever having released a drug before! I found this all to be very interesting! I&#39;d like to share the basics of what I learned, and also get opinions on this stock....</p>\n\n<p>The company as mentioned, is a &quot;clinical-stage pharmaceutical company&quot;, which I take to basically mean they have no approved drugs yet. My friend called it a gofundme for drugs when I explained it to him lol. They have been working on one drug, oral antibiotics for treating UTIs, which currently does not exist.</p>\n\n<p>They have complete phase 3 (of which there are 4 phases) trials with good results and have applied with the FDA for approval(NDA). Approval for this drug is on FDAs &quot;priority list&quot;, meaning if approved it is somewhat fast-tracked through the approval process. Expected approval is July of this year.</p>\n\n<p>From my research I gather that the majority of drugs that pass phase 3 and apply for NDA are eventually approved. Something like over 80%. The company has also recently made a public offering of almost 2 million shares to raise capital that will cover operating expenses until 2023 (that happened a few days ago). They also recently created an agreement with a firm that specializes in assisting drug companies in the final phases of development to bring the drug to market(also very recent activity).</p>\n\n<p>The stock price has really only gone down since the IPO and is currently at almost an all time low.</p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems like the approval of this drug is imminent. Why would they be partnering with a company to hash out the logistics of the release if this weren&#39;t the case? Why would they still be raising capital if this were not the case? I have a strong sense that the drug will be approved.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any experienced pharma investors here that can chime in on this or give their thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>Does it follow that if the drug is approved the price will go up as I predict? Or is the price built in?</p>\n\n<p>I think there is still quite some dd to do on this such as what would the drug cost and how many people need it, what is the competition, etc. Starting to look into these things but it gets pretty complicated.</p>\n\n<p>Still a lot to learn but I feel good about this investment after my initial blindfolded dart throw.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lihv5p/itrm_and_pharma_investing/","title":"$ITRM and pharma investing","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T14:43:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 14:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2f1bbabd-acd0-591c-aa9e-9a758c1b93fa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lihv5p/itrm_and_pharma_investing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lihv5p/itrm_and_pharma_investing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Canuhere","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Canuhere","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Canuhere","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$ITRM和制药业投资","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，这是我第一次在这里发半dd的帖子。我进入$ITRM约\n几天前的500美元，却没有真正了解它的情况，这是一个愚蠢的举动。\n一个绿色的投资者。只是因为我在什么都不知道的情况下买了它，所以才会很傻。\n关于股票，只是看到了一些关于它的对话... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$ITRM和製藥業投資","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，這是我第一次在這裏發半dd的帖子。我進入$ITRM約\n幾天前的500美元，卻沒有真正瞭解它的情況，這是一個愚蠢的舉動。\n一個綠色的投資者。只是因爲我在什麼都不知道的情況下買了它，所以纔會很傻。\n關於股票，只是看到了一些關於它的對話... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ca187c98-7048-55fe-94c5-6bff47b06bc8","excerpt":"🦍 Ape bought $10M worth of GME near the peak of its Reddit-hype, the position\nis now worth $2M\n\n🦍 Ape also bought $1M in AMC and $1M in Silver\n\n\n\nArticle (trimmed):\n\nSun, the 30 year-old entrepreneur who bought $10 million worth of GameStop Corp.\nat the height of its Reddit-fueled rally, is…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lit39w/autist_rich_asian_ape_bought_10m_of_gme_near_its/","title":"Autist Rich Asian: Ape bought $10M of GME near its peak ($8M Loss)","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"自闭症富豪亚洲人。猩猩在高峰期附近买入1000万的金交所（亏损800万）。","the_new_excerpt":"🦍猿在Reddit-hype高峰期附近买入了价值1000万美元的GME，这个仓位\n现在价值200万\n\n🦍猿也买了100万美金的AMC和100万美金的Silver。\n\n\n\n文章（被删减）。\n\n孙，30岁的企业家谁买了1000万美元的价值GameStop公司。\n在Reddit推动的涨势最猛烈的时候，30岁的企业家孙先生正...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"自閉症富豪亞洲人。猩猩在高峯期附近買入1000萬的金交所（虧損800萬）。","the_new_excerpt":"🦍猿在Reddit-hype高峯期附近買入了價值1000萬美元的GME，這個倉位\n現在價值200萬\n\n🦍猿也買了100萬美金的AMC和100萬美金的Silver。\n\n\n\n文章（被刪減）。\n\n孫，30歲的企業家誰買了1000萬美元的價值GameStop公司。\n在Reddit推動的漲勢最猛烈的時候，30歲的企業家孫先生正...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1360585341720268802","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1360585341720268802","title":"Today is Saturday.
