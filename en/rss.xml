The situation is still volatile but I am planning to buy copper stocks because of the dip knowing that the demand for copper will just keep on increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already placed some in&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southerncoppercorp.com/&quot;&gt; Southern Copper Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (SCCO) since they are paying a dividend of $2.70 per share. I’m thinking of placing in Fortitude Gold, since they’re also paying a dividend which they just increased recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also into getting some juniors seeing how these companies might have some future once the demand for copper increases even more. I’m thinking of getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://cumtn.com/&quot;&gt;Copper Mountain Mining&lt;/a&gt; (CMMC), since they are already producing approximately 100 million pounds of copper equivalent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threevalleycopper.com/&quot;&gt;Three Valley Copper&lt;/a&gt; (TVC) is also promising especially after their upsize with a recent deal financing up to $16 million. Their second quarter results are also remarkable and they are expected to start annual production by the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copper demand is rising and will probably increase and even double in the next few years so I’m taking my chance on this metal. I didn’t put much anyways since I’m making sure I only invest the money I know I might lose in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

Since investing in something safer like SPYG or apple might have more guaranteed returns but if i bought in right now and it just returned to 60 which is below its 52 week high by alot i would essentially double my money but theres a lot of uncertainty with DKNG. So i came here for more informed opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

I was having fun just moving shares around and making small amounts of money. Then a few weeks ago I decided to try options. I bought an apple call that went up a couple hundred bucks. I was amazed at how easy it was to make money with options. Then I decided to put a bunch of money into Delta Airlines calls expiring in January and February. Initially they went up, and I was making more money than ever before. But then they started to go down. As I&amp;#39;m writing this, my weekly chart is down almost 20%. This is all the money I had in my saving account. I&amp;#39;m not sure when I will crack, but at this rate it will be sometime soon. I&amp;#39;m still holding, but I can&amp;#39;t focus on school or anything else because all I can think about is how much money I&amp;#39;m losing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, how do you guys deal with waking up in the morning and seeing huge losses? How do you keep going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks for all the great advice guys! So many responses! For now my plan is to keep holding because my &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/uV6mzeO&quot;&gt;fortune cookie &lt;/a&gt;from lunch told me to, and I still have a few months till the calls expire.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s talk about their evaluation…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nvidia&amp;#39;s current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia&amp;#39;s plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EBITDA&lt;/strong&gt;, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization&lt;/p&gt;

As someone greatly explained it to me,   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problem is that with shorts you are not betting that the stocks is undervalued, you are betting that people will realize within a short span of time that it is overvalued which is more risky than the former.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I been seeing and hearing lately a lot of people looking for long-term investments during 2021. Don&amp;#39;t mean to be a bear, but it&amp;#39;s important to understand that the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of companies out there going mainstream with potential for a bright future. EV sector, Renewable sector, Crypto, Fintech &amp;amp; Tech, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree. I firmly believe renewables, electric vehicles, and internet-based payments are, in fact, the future. EV vehicle sales are growing at exponential paces. Solar panels will be seen more and more in your neighborhoods. ATMs probably won&amp;#39;t even exist in 2030. Major cities are pushing for 100% electric buses by 2035. Major car dealerships are expecting to sell only EVs by 2040. Crypto is making a push as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s important is also hopping in the stock at the right price. Now, I&amp;#39;m not advocating for market timing. But hopping into Rivian, whose currently valued at $100B with 0 sales is just insane. Lucid being another one whose valued at $75B with a QUARTER of a MILLION in sales. Don&amp;#39;t even get me started on $PLUG. $PLUG is a leader in hydrogen fuel cells for forklifts that reported negative revenue (wtf) and is valued $23B. We all know Tesla is a leader in its sector as well, but the price is outrageous. History has shown prices will always correct based on the company&amp;#39;s fundamentals. Too many posts on $TSLA so I won&amp;#39;t go into this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no doubt we are in a bubble. Lots of &amp;quot;Stock Gurus&amp;quot; on Instagram promoting all these overvalued stocks just because their &amp;quot;future looks bright&amp;quot;, and here come all these people commenting talking about how they just invested for the long term. Not saying their future isn&amp;#39;t bright, but it&amp;#39;s important to know when a stock is reasonably priced as opposed to just hearing a pitch line and going all in if they convince you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no ounce of doubt the prices will drop substantially. I&amp;#39;m not worried about missing out on these hyped stocks. And no, I&amp;#39;m not talking about a 30% correction. Check the dot com bubble companies. I&amp;#39;m talking 95% corrections. Several bankruptcies across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2000 dot-com market collapse was triggered by technology stocks. Investors&amp;#39; interest in internet related companies increased to a frenzied level following massive growth and adoption of the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was the unprecedented rise in equity valuations of internet-based tech companies during the bull market of the late 1990s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dotcom bubble burst when capital began to dry up. In the years preceding the bubble, record low interest rates, the adoption of the Internet, and interest in technology companies allowed capital to flow freely, especially to startup companies that had no track record of success.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not here to spark rage or scare you. It&amp;#39;s just the hard truth, lots of inexperienced investors have no idea how crazy the outcome could get. Once the big banks and heads at Wall Street realize its insanely overvalued, the rug pull will come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if I&amp;#39;m wrong. Curious to hear everyone&amp;#39;s thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

While this is kind of silly and a bit absurd (though it did happen!), I think it’s worth examining and explaining how the incentives for a self-regulatory, for-profit company lead to extreme complexity and subsidization in US markets. It’s easy to say “self-regulatory BAD!” but harder to understand the web of complexity that such perverse structures create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a long post. By the end, I hope you understand what the self-regulatory structure is, why it exists, why it creates perverse incentives, and how I think it should be fixed. I’ll do my best to explain the context of these archaic structure, why it leads to unnecessary complexity, and reduces competitive forces. Most importantly, throughout the piece think about how such perverse incentives leads to lax enforcement and wrist slaps, and a cozy relationship with the industry being regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial services industry is the only industry in America (that I am aware of) in which for-profit, publicly traded firms are “self-regulatory.” What does “self-regulatory” mean and where did it come from? The structure came about from the member-owned stock exchanges that existed prior to 1934. In 1934 these exchanges were brought into partnership with federal regulators in the Exchange Act of 1934. This actually made a lot of sense. There was nobody better positioned to monitor and enforce the rules of a stock exchange (where trading happened in a physical location, on the floor of the exchange) than the exchange itself. There were conflicts-of-interest, of course, but there were also practical considerations of what technology and communication systems looked like in the early 1900s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does “self-regulatory” mean? Now of course, I’m no lawyer, so take everything I say with that in mind. Essentially the self-regulatory structure gives the regulation arm of the exchange quasi-governmental powers (it’s been explained to me that this structure means the exchange is supposed to act as an extension of the SEC) – and gives the exchange itself immunity from prosecution when carrying out regulatory functions. It basically means that US exchanges set the rules for trading in US markets, and for interacting with their business, are then in charge of enforcing those rules and have no legal liability in the operation of that business. Those rules include things like fee structure, order types, matching priority model, co-location and data feed costs, and many other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means each for-profit exchange is setting its own rules, and responsible for enforcing those rules. Each exchange is responsible for monitoring its own market for manipulation (called “market surveillance”). In reality, the responsibility for market surveillance is outsourced to FINRA. FINRA is another SRO – they are not a for-profit exchange, but they are responsible for setting the rules and policing broker/dealers. You may have heard of some of the other SROs – the DTCC, the OCC, the NSCC and others listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINRA, DTCC, OCC and NSCC are not for-profit, of course, but they are deeply conflicted. They operate on the fees generated by their members, who they police and regulate; stock exchanges do too – their best customers are high-speed speculators (aka HFT), who submit 95% of all orders, and are a party to ~90% of all trades. These speculators also pay for expensive, proprietary data feeds, high-speed connections and cross-connects, and other exchange services. SROs are supposed to police these customers, and are charged with ensuring that their best customers follow the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gee Dave, that sounds like a conflict-of-interest! At least it’s not for anything important, like the foundation of the US economy, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generally the SROs that have made breaking the rules a cost of doing business (naturally following the lead of the SEC, of course). While they don’t have the authority to press criminal charges (again, not a lawyer) they could easily make referrals and work with the DOJ, who does have that authority. Instead, nearly all of Wall St has decided that breaking the rules is nearly always only worth a fine, very rarely an industry ban, and practically never a perp walk and prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like nobody lost their banking license for fraud following the Great Financial Crisis, can you remember a time when a major broker/dealer had their license revoked? Robinhood has been fined well over $100M by FINRA and the SEC for lying to their customers, failing to provide best execution, and underinvesting in compliance, technology and any system for protecting their customers. For some reason, none of this was enough to lose their license to operate. Those guys are laughing all the way to the bank. Fine after fine is charged to every broker on Wall St, paid by the shareholders, and everyone keeps collecting their bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First SRO Problem: Reluctance to exact severe consequences because the fees being collected from the perps are paying for SRO operations and bonuses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there’s another side to all of this. Let’s take a concrete example to start. In 2014, BATS and DirectEdge merged. Together, they represented approximately 20% of trading in the US. Each of them operated 2 copycat exchanges – a maker/taker exchange (BZX and EDGX) and an inverted exchange (BYX and EDGA). In any other industry, such a merger would result in the consolidation of these exchanges so that the resulting company would only operate 2 exchanges. But that didn’t happen here. They continued to run 4 exchanges and do to this day. Why would they do that when it costs way more to run 4 exchanges rather than 2? The answer is actually quite simple and obvious – money. To understand why, we have to take a quick step back, and reference another law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1975 Amendments to the 1934 Exchange Act established the need (and gave the SEC the authority) to create the Securities Information Processor (SIP). It was groundbreaking at the time. The SIP is the “ticker” – a record of quotes and trades on all national securities exchanges. Ultimately the SEC did NOT create such a system though, it delegated the authority to the exchanges. The exchanges created the NMS Committees, which are responsible for managing the SIP and setting fees. From last year’s SEC press release announcing changes to the SIP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  1975, one of Congress’s principal objectives for the national  market  system was to assure the availability of information with respect  to  quotations for, and transactions in, securities.  The national   securities exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority   (“FINRA” and collectively, the “SROs”) have acted jointly to collect,   consolidate, and disseminate information for NMS stocks.  For each NMS   stock, the SROs were required to provide specified NMS market data to   exclusive securities information processors (“SIPs”).  The SIPs then   consolidated that information and made it available to the public.  The   rules adopted today are designed to modernize and improve upon that   historical infrastructure, by expanding the content of NMS market data   and replacing the historical “exclusive SIP” model with a decentralized   model of “competing consolidators.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALRIGHT ENOUGH HISTORY DAVE, WTF IS THE SIP??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, it’s hard to talk about this stuff without getting deep in the weeds. The SIP is generally referred to as the “public data feed” – at the moment (though this is changing), it provides top-of-book quotes across all US exchanges, calculates the NBBO and publishes it, communicates regulatory halts and other information, and publishes all trades both on- and off-exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And guess what? You pay for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right – you are paying for the SIP. Nearly every retail broker subscribes to the SIP, and generally speaking when you see the prices that a stock is being quoted at, or trading for, you’re seeing SIP data. This public data feed costs $4 per user, per month, for non-professional, display-only users – if you’re not a financial professional, and you’re only seeing the data with your eyes (rather than programming a trading system that will automatically look at the data), then you are a non-professional, display-only user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are all of those user fees worth? Something on the order of &amp;gt; $300M per year. That money is collected by the operators of the SIP (NYSE and Nasdaq), and distributed according to a very complicated formula to each of the exchanges. On the whole, it gets divided up based on quoting and trading market share, and means that approximately $100M every year goes to CBOE, NYSE and Nasdaq (with much less going to the smaller exchanges). That’s why BATS/DirectEdge (and now CBOE, which acquired them in 2016) was incentivized to continue to operate 4 exchanges, because it meant that more of this public subsidy would go to them. Talk about perverse – it’s the exact opposite of what the 1934 Exchange Act was established to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets even worse (No way Dave! How can it be worse than this??). Each exchange sells private data feeds that are faster and contain more information than the SIP. So the exchanges are incentivized to ensure that the SIP remains slow, and has less data, so they can make more money selling their private feeds. Pretty sweet gig if you can get it, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve simplified the issue, of course. It gets even more complex with Reg NMS and order protection, which requires all exchanges to connect and route to one another, and brokers to manage that complexity as well. It means that CBOE gets double the revenue for private market data, and other connectivity fees, all of which ensures that CBOE earnings per share are robust and growing, and which accomplishes the opposite of the intention of the 1934 Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second SRO Problem: SRO structure is a classic example of regulation and subsidy creating inefficient and costly complexity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BATS/DirectEdge example is only one of so many that highlight the unnecessary complexity at the heart of US markets. I’ve talked many times about the need for regulators to understand complex systems and systems theory, to understand evolving regulatory structures in that context, and to focus on simplifying markets rather than making them more complex. Unnecessary complexity leads to several problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opacity – it becomes very difficult to understand these complex systems. That leads to mistrust, and potentially loss of confidence. We are seeing that play out right now in the retail community, and for good reason. Nobody trusts Wall St.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragility – unnecessary complexity can lead to fragility. For example, the segmentation in US markets that diverts retail order flow to the duopoly of Citadel and Virtu leaves exchanges as toxic cesspools that discourage market making. This both widens spreads and reduces market making diversity, leading to behavior that can result in illiquidity contagions (mini flash crashes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rent Seeking and Concentration – unnecessary complexity incentivizes a select few firms to master the complexity. This puts them in a privileged position, and creates economies of scale where the more of the market they master and control, the more information they have that others don’t, and the more they’re able to master and control. They push SROs to create ever more complexity to maintain their incumbent position, and are able to extract rents as a result. The SROs listen to these firms because they are responsible for more and more trading activity, which means they are the SROs’ best customers. Instead of SROs following their duties under the 1934 Act, they act in the interests of their shareholders to maximize revenue. This cycle continues unabated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third SRO Problem: Unnecessary complexity makes markets opaque, fragile and leads to a feedback loop of rent seeking and concentration of power. The for-profit motive overrides the SRO’s duty to create fair and efficient markets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned before that SROs have legal immunity. This means many things, but primarily it means that the brokers who are members of the exchange don’t have legal recourse when something goes wrong. It is for this reason that retail brokers who don’t accept PFOF still route to the off-exchange duopoly of Citadel and Virtu, because they want someone’s neck to wring when something goes wrong. The legal immunity that exchanges enjoy is one of the reasons that we have dramatically segmented markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth SRO Problem: Legal immunity for for-profit, publicly traded companies leads to perverse incentives and terrible outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the result? A huge amount of unnecessary complexity, enforcement becoming a cost of doing business, and ultimately fragile markets with low participant diversity delivering poor outcomes for investors as the for-profit SROs focus on creating churn and volume to increase earnings per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More complexity means more fragmentation. More fragmentation means more complex order types. More fragmentation and complex order types means more unnecessary trading and churn. More unnecessary trading and churn means more earnings for publicly traded SROs. Rinse and repeat. It ultimately means that we end up with so much complexity that it’s impossible to keep track of. Take a look at the results of this 2018 RBC study on exchange fee structure (the picture is awesome, but I can&amp;#39;t seem to add pictures to a post in this sub-reddit):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchanges have at least 1,023 pricing “paths”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3,762  separate pricing variables across the exchanges – “strongly suggest  that exchange prices are tailored and offered on a bespoke basis”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme complexity, customized for specific firms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme routing distortion (TD’s “virtually all” limit orders routed to EDGX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fee-agnostic brokers had 7x better VWAP performance (Clearpool)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone can explain how this fee structure “promotes just and equitable principles of trade,” “protects investors and the public interest,” and is “not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers” I’m all ears. Go ahead, give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s take this convoluted, inefficient structure, add in a regulatory revolving door, corrupt campaign contribution system and corrupt politicians, mix it all together, and out comes the US crony capitalist system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET OFF THE SOAP BOX DAVE, WHAT DO WE DO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So glad you asked. I’ve been asked a bunch of times what I think should change about US market structure, what I would do if I was SEC Chair (imagine that), etc. My answer is nearly always the same – reduce complexity. When I say reduce complexity, this post is what I’m talking about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· End the self-regulatory structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Build a proper regulator (complete overhaul of the SEC) with experts who are compensated appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Prioritize handcuffs, not wrist slaps and fines. Make the industry fearful of regulatory and enforcement consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Reduce the number of exchanges, end public subsidy through SIP fees, get rid of every copycat exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Create a burden for off-exchange trading to compensate for the damage that segmenting and diverting flow does to the price discovery mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Simplify, Simplify, SIMPLIFY!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; Wall St cannot regulate itself. It leads to unnecessary complexity, and lax enforcement and fines instead of perp walks. It’s time to overhaul the regulatory structure, send people to jail, and simplify market structure dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

For stocks, the community will often be heavily in favor on the stock and will down vote or attack anyone who disagrees it is not the next big thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is depressing seeing the amount of outright shaming that goes on. For example, after a rough few weeks of trading, one of the top posts on &lt;a href=&quot;/r/shroomstocks&quot;&gt;/r/shroomstocks&lt;/a&gt; (a subreddit dedicated to stocks having to do with psychedelics) is &amp;quot;Seriously, who are the losers selling at these prices right now?&amp;quot; Does this seem like healthy behavior to you? Implying your stock is a test of courage and you will be rewarded for your patience. If you are not completely faithful in the stock (which can lead to even worshipping the management), you are attacked for questioning what is obviously true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recall about a year ago and the obsession with Cathie Woods, also viewed by many to be infallible. After a couple successful years she was viewed as the next Buffet and if you dared to complain on a down day you would constantly be reminded of how it&amp;#39;s a five-year hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure many of those who were on &lt;a href=&quot;/r/PSTH&quot;&gt;/r/PSTH&lt;/a&gt; can relate. Questioning the company was seen as questioning Bill Ackman himself. Over time the sub shifted to humor as a means of getting over the losses (although there were still people who fervently believed in the SPACman!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? I find some &amp;quot;communities&amp;quot; to be outright manipulative for those with dissenting views.&lt;/p&gt;

Bernstein’s Harshita Rawat downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform Wednesday, citing various competitive pressures for the digital payments giant. Shares of PayPal PYPL, -4.36% are off 2.5% in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rawat worries about the “increasing aggregation” of e-commerce activity on large platforms like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.23% and Shopify Inc. SHOP, -2.24%, which she estimates are together responsible for about 32% of U.S. commerce. “Amazon currently doesn’t accept PayPal and just agreed to accept Venmo starting in 2022,” she wrote. “Shopify has ambitions of creating its own payments business and has been pushing its merchants aggressively to convert to Shopify payments platform (and also towards the Shop Pay button).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller merchants “are PayPal’s bread and butter, and Shopify’s meteoric rise and push towards its own payments platform is particularly problematic,” Rawat continued. PayPal’s transaction economics are better with smaller businesses than with very large ones, she argued. Shopify Inc. represents an “unassailable competitor” when it comes to the small-business demographic, in her view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rawat is also concerned that PayPal’s market-share gains will slow. The company has typically won share at the expense of manual card entry onto a website, but fewer consumers are entering their card information this way, she said, meaning there is less available land to grab there. She estimates that manual card entry now accounts for about 20% of e-commerce checkout, down from roughly 33% four years back. More broadly, she thinks that share gains could slow “by a thousand cuts” thanks to the rise of a number of technologies that separately eat away at opportunities for PayPal. These include the growth of buy-now pay-later (BNPL) services, the ability to auto-fill credit-card information on some web browsers, and the threat of Apple Pay as ever more commerce shifts online. “It is an understatement to say that the payments landscape is rapidly evolving with many powerful trends emerging,” Rawat said in her note to clients. “While PayPal is actively investing and evolving, it simply has more turf to defend versus peers in our view.” Rawat acknowledged that her thesis could prove incorrect if PayPal delivers upbeat surprises with its efforts to drive more revenue from its Venmo app and its “superapp” redesign that focuses on features beyond just payments. “After years of false starts, we believe Venmo is finally on the cusp of getting monetized,” she wrote. While Rawat has “historically been skeptical of aggressive monetization estimates for Venmo,” she feels more “constructive” now. “Venmo monetization is now less about following the PayPal playbook and more about following Cash App’s journey,” she wrote, referencing Square Inc.’s SQ, -2.78% mobile wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of PayPal have declined 20% over the past three months as the S&amp;amp;P 500 SPX, -0.26% has risen about 6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Numbers For Today &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.34%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (AAPL): +2.9%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon (AMZN): +4.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA (NVDA): +8.25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:&lt;/strong&gt; 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing claims, week ended November 5:&lt;/strong&gt; 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of Alibaba (BABA) fell after the company disappointed in their latest earnings report and slashed guidance for the full year, citing slowing consumption trends in China. Here are the numbers:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue&lt;/strong&gt; $31.15 billion vs $32 billion expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPS&lt;/strong&gt;: $1.74 vs $1.93 expected. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidance Forecast:&lt;/strong&gt; 20-23% growth in fiscal 2022 revenue, down from 27% growth expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite stock, exploded higher after the company posted record revenues in gaming and data center sales and raised guidance moving forward. CEO Jensen Huang said, “Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations.&amp;quot; Here are the numbers:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue:&lt;/strong&gt; $7.1 billion versus $6.81 billion expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earnings per share:&lt;/strong&gt; $1.17 versus $1.11 expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming revenue:&lt;/strong&gt; $3.22 billion versus $3.18 billion expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Center revenue:&lt;/strong&gt; $2.94 billion versus $2.69 billion expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecast for Q4:&lt;/strong&gt; Revenue and EPS expected to grow 50% year-over-year, much higher than 38% growth expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bipartisan coalition of State Attorney Generals said it was launching an investigation into Instagram’s effects on children and Facebook’s role in promoting the service to young kids. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to a report by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, Apple (AAPL) is working to speed up development of its electric car and is refocusing the project around full self-driving capabilities. According to the report, the company is pushing for a debut as early as 2025. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle&quot;&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amid the global shortage of semiconductors, Ford Motors (F) announced it was entering into a strategic agreement with US based chipmaker GlobalFoundries (GFS) to develop its own chips. General Motors (GM) as also stated their intention to deepen ties with chipmakers to eventually co-develop their own chips as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starbucks (SBUX) partnered with Amazon Go to use their technology to develop their first cashier-less location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla (TSLA) recalls 7,600 vehicles in the US for potential problems with the airbags. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After putting aside ~6 months of savings + some other planned expenses, I&amp;#39;d have 60 - 80K left over doing nothing but losing value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hearing a lot about a market crash, but even that sounds better than letting inflation eat away at my savings. I currently make small purchases through the Public app, but I&amp;#39;m considering wealthfront, or something similar, to manage a larger portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, all. Given all the advice, I think I&amp;#39;m going to start with a smaller lump sum right now and then cost-average bi-weekly. I&amp;#39;ll probably add another lump sum Q1 next year after budgeting a little for real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

This may lead to the question- are we in a bubble?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the S&amp;amp;P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hasn&amp;#39;t been the case in current years. Currently, the S&amp;amp;P500&amp;#39;s forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with the &amp;#39;99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&amp;amp;P500 earnings yield prior to the crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren&amp;#39;t growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, &amp;quot;Value&amp;quot; stocks usually outperform &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%,  future earnings are worth very close to present earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own &amp;quot;Dinosaur&amp;quot; companies that aren&amp;#39;t growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, my portfolio is tilted very high towards value stocks and profitable stocks. I hold Fidelity Large Cap Value and Fidelity Small Cap value, and Fidelity Real Estate, as well as VYM and VIG as an indirect way to factor tilt towards profitable stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, stocks always carry market risk. A recession can drive a crash due to lower earnings, as it did in 2009, and in 2020. If you are investing for the short term, it may be smart to avoid having too much in equities.&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to take a quick look at the company.  Their Vehicle is... not very impressive, no groundbreaking range, efficiency or price improvements.  Their big selling point is solar cells plastered all over the vehicle, which many companies are exploring.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about the company here:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonomotors.com/&quot;&gt;https://sonomotors.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, who exactly is building these cars?  Surely a startup this size can&amp;#39;t mass produce $30,000 vehicles.  The answer is National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS).  They bought SAAB&amp;#39;s assets in 2012 with the intent to make a SAAB 9-3 EV.  In almost a decade, no vehicle has made it to production.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets worse.  NEVS is a subsidiary of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, A subsidiary of Evergrande Health Industry Group, who bought 100% of NEVS in 2020.  Evergrande Health is, of course, a subsidiary Evergrande Group.  Also of note, NEVS haven&amp;#39;t filed any reports since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEVS ownership structure and investor relations:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nevs.com/en/investors/owner-structure/&quot;&gt;https://www.nevs.com/en/investors/owner-structure/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This  company has managed to put their manufacturing into the hands of, ostensibly, an incompetent and unproven manufacturer, which is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Evergrande Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ever there were an EV stock to avoid... this would be it.&lt;/p&gt;

But ended up buying a SPY Tech ETF. When I looked back I saw that SONY at times actually outpferforms Microsoft and that for close to 10 years. Granted they were beaten to the ground prior in 2010 but how their last CEO turned that business around in pretty much all areas is a masterwork. When I did more research I found out that an important factor to their success was their CFO at that time, who has become their current new CEO in just 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was mostly interested in their Playtation devision because I see how far ahead they are in storytelling and grahpics compared to other AAA developers and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I actually like each divison they are in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Television/Pictures: they dont have a big streaming service but they produce like 2 or 3 of Netflix biggest hits (The Crown, Bridgerton, Cobra Kai, Better call Saul) and they did Breaking Bad. I feel their television arm is morphing more and more into another HBO quality wise. I expect Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Disney to lit. fight for this content in future and Sony television can easy profit. And well Spiderman: Now way Home is a Sony movie afterall and breaking records for that franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music: Sony Music is the 2nd largest Music label in the world and they are not stopping growing. Again they dont own a streaming service, but they make equal good money by licensing and with the closer becoming fan interaction of artists and their fans --maybe in VR-- (where Sony is also big into btw.) I can see them going a more direct way to present live conerts etc. skipping Spotify, Youtube etc. They already partnered up with one of the big 3 kpop labels to get as one of the first big music labels exposure to that lucrative market, so they are in the Zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronics/Sensing/Imaging: I see mostly growth in Sensing and imaging technology for the EV market(cars and other vehicles). Electronics I dont think is too hot at the moment but I see their TVs and Smartphone being in the premium segment now where margin is better. Its already worth it to have that direct 2 consumer relationship imo and they can build up from here with VR and AR devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming: With Tencent is Sony the best and fastest growing Gaming company imo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are quite heavily advancing with their Playstation Studios portfolio aquiring left and right and increasing their existing studio size. I am not into the metaverse talk, but when Playtation would want to one Im sure they could. They talk how they want more exposure to 1st party big multiplayer titles, whereas last generation they mostly concentrated their efforts to deliver big quality singe player games. Mulitplayer brings more profit, so thats bullish. They are also devloping Playstation VR2 for release in 2022, which would for example let you play also any non VR game with rudimentary VR support. With all the metaverse (bullshit)talk I can see that reveal create kinda a buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also own Sony Bank, one of the biggest japanese digital banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thats about their current divisions. In the coming years, they plan to enter semi business in corporation with TSMC and build up a new core business pillar for them as they call it: Anime. They now own the biggest box office anime hit in history with Demon Salyer. That IP is so big, it generated 8 BILLION USD in revenue (&lt;a href=&quot;https://animesweet.com/anime/demon-slayer-the-series-unstoppable-success-topped-8-billion/&quot;&gt;https://animesweet.com/anime/demon-slayer-the-series-unstoppable-success-topped-8-billion/&lt;/a&gt;).  Granted, across different companies and with Merch, (mobile/console)games etc. but when they can create one such anime hit, they have the chance for another. Netflix for example produces --while quality anime content-- but not one of that caliber of Demon Salyer. With Sony having much closer ties to many japanese anime studios I can see them creating the defacto streaming service and having a chance for that next One Piece killer. Merch is brining in the money, not the movies itself. They already own Funimation and Crunchyroll and are currently working on combining them...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YTD performance: 36%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Cap: 154B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past 5 years: 304%&lt;/p&gt;

The bank said many factors behind surging consumer prices were “beyond monetary policy’s control” and that it would “consider” ending its cycle of rate cuts this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the decision Turkey’s lira plummeted about 4%, hitting 11 against the US dollar for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a political move by Erdogan? I do not have a great understanding of Turkish politics, however, Erdogan does not seem to be well liked by Turkish people I know and this decision seems irrational. Erdogan apparently holds the view that high interest causes inflation rather than tame it. Where else has this type of thinking been seen? Is it that common at all? This is the first time I have seen that opinion on interest rates and inflation&lt;/p&gt;
