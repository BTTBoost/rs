Make that big first trade something to REALLY brag about or turn those shares you’ve piled up into some serious equity! See you Monday bright and early retards 💎🙌🏻</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Things to note for all the comments asking the same questions:\n1.) can I still buy in? \n     Yes, buy as many shares or calls as you want but for for devilssake don’t put your grocery money, rent money, or bail money on this shit. Only what you can afford to loose. At the end of the day, don’t end up becoming like the thing we swore to destroy</p>\n\n<p>2.) shares or calls? \n     Shares are the driving force of this surge. Safer in the long run even if you buy at whatever “top” you think it’s at because if it goes down a couple bucks and you succumb to paper hands then you’re not out the money like you be in calls. \n     Calls are a way to make money or loose money in ludicrous speed as well, but keep in mind non of this would be possible without shares and in the end it’ll still be shares that stand the strongest. Only my OPINION. </p>\n\n<p>3.) who is <a href=\"/u/Deepfuckingvalue\">u/Deepfuckingvalue</a> ? \n     Simple: THE FUCKING MAN, that’s who. So stfu and thank him in your weekend-closed prayers. </p>\n\n<p>4.) what are my positions? \n     I won’t post mine because I’m in a pickle with the whole “don’t tell your family how much you make” conundrum, and thanks to this post I think I just doxxed myself... so let’s just say I’m in the “retarded” position. </p>\n\n<p>5.) what’s the top? \n     The top is when you’ve had enough. When you can’t take the pressure of the “gamble”. When you look at yourself in the mirror and say “not today paper hands” or when it all comes crashing down to 0 after the peak at $420.69 (EDIT or at 1,000,000 fuckers it was a joke duh) All I can say is get out when you’re ready to not have FOMO in either direction it goes thereafter. </p>\n\n<p>6.) Lastly, why are you reading this shit? \n     Because you’re regarded. I am retarded, and I don’t deserve a podium anymore then any of you. Take your gold back and your silver back and spend it on GME shares, please. 🚀🚀🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l31zkn/gme_is_going_into_triple_digits_next_week_sell_at/","title":"GME is going into triple digits next week sell at your own risk","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T11:08:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 11:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e58b3688-7ed6-56cb-80c3-2cafcd5d1002","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l31zkn/gme_is_going_into_triple_digits_next_week_sell_at/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l31zkn/gme_is_going_into_triple_digits_next_week_sell_at/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Your_Boy_Roy_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Your_Boy_Roy_","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Your_Boy_Roy_","score":3534,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME下周将进入三位数卖出，风险自担。","the_new_excerpt":"我看到人们卖出他们的股票，原因是非常快乐的，我知道这意味着一个。\n很多给你们，毕竟我们不可能都是DFV，因为他是一个传奇。\n\n但是下周要过100美元是很EASILY的，即使你觉得这是你的\n第一次 \"大获全胜 \"作为一个新的交易者，你并不孤单，有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME下週將進入三位數賣出，風險自擔。","the_new_excerpt":"我看到人們賣出他們的股票，原因是非常快樂的，我知道這意味着一個。\n很多給你們，畢竟我們不可能都是DFV，因爲他是一個傳奇。\n\n但是下週要過100美元是很EASILY的，即使你覺得這是你的\n第一次 \"大獲全勝 \"作爲一個新的交易者，你並不孤單，有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bfa95dd4-22c6-5e0f-b182-3a7552e90cf2","excerpt":"I know it's hard to read and many of us can't, but hear me out.\n\nIf you entered and exited a position (yes options or shares) within 365 days,\nany gains (or losses) will be considered ordinary income.\n\nMeaning all those gains (minus any losses) are added to whatever you make all\nyear at Wendy's to…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2y8jw/hi_retards_its_your_mom_dont_forget_taxes/","title":"Hi Retards It's Your Mom - Don't Forget Taxes","date":"January 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"嗨，智障，我是你妈，别忘了交税。","the_new_excerpt":"我知道这很难看，我们很多人都看不懂，但听我说。\n\n如果你在365天内进入并退出了一个仓位（是的期权或股票）。\n任何收益（或损失）将被视为普通收入。\n\n意思是说，所有这些收益（减去任何损失）都会被加到你所赚的所有收入中。\n在Wendy's工作了一年，以...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"嗨，智障，我是你媽，別忘了交稅。","the_new_excerpt":"我知道這很難看，我們很多人都看不懂，但聽我說。\n\n如果你在365天內進入並退出了一個倉位（是的期權或股票）。\n任何收益（或損失）將被視爲普通收入。\n\n意思是說，所有這些收益（減去任何損失）都會被加到你所賺的所有收入中。\n在Wendy's工作了一年，以...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-0f0d1d3c-96fb-5036-a27c-f55339230dd9","excerpt":"Given the global indebtedness, it could be plausible food could become\nexceedingly expensive (see inflation and the Bengal Famine 1943) or completely\nunprofitable (see deflation effects during the US’s Great Depression 1931~1934).\n\nIf an investment is done because marginal utility is expected to…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l32z2x/bill_melinda_gates_are_now_the_largest_farm/","title":"Bill & Melinda Gates are now the largest farm landowners, but why...?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 23, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"比尔和梅琳达-盖茨现在是最大的农场地主，但为什么......？","the_new_excerpt":"考虑到全球的债务问题，粮食可能会成为一个合理的选择。\n极度昂贵(见通货膨胀和1943年孟加拉饥荒)或完全不昂贵\n无利可图（见美国1931~1934年大萧条期间的通货紧缩效应）。\n\n如果一项投资是因为预期边际效用会...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"比爾和梅琳達-蓋茨現在是最大的農場地主，但爲什麼......？","the_new_excerpt":"考慮到全球的債務問題，糧食可能會成爲一個合理的選擇。\n極度昂貴(見通貨膨脹和1943年孟加拉饑荒)或完全不昂貴\n無利可圖（見美國1931~1934年大蕭條期間的通貨緊縮效應）。\n\n如果一項投資是因爲預期邊際效用會...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-e58b3688-7ed6-56cb-80c3-2cafcd5d1002","previousId":"RedditPost-bfa95dd4-22c6-5e0f-b182-3a7552e90cf2","nextId":"RedditPost-0f0d1d3c-96fb-5036-a27c-f55339230dd9","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l31zkn/gme_is_going_into_triple_digits_next_week_sell_at/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
