This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).</p>\n\n<p>By &#39;sharing&#39;, I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.</p>\n\n<p>Just imagine this, Tesla only has <strong>&lt;2 million</strong> vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading &quot;self-driving car&quot; company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). </p>\n\n<p>Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from <strong>&gt;175 million</strong> vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.</p>\n\n<p>With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers&#39; lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry&#39;s transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.</p>\n\n<p>IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/metref/bb_the_size_of_the_realworld_driving_datasets/","title":"[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla's","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-28T07:39:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-28 07:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ffb7ab42-7804-543f-8a0b-f20004e5f8e4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/metref/bb_the_size_of_the_realworld_driving_datasets/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/metref/bb_the_size_of_the_realworld_driving_datasets/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Character-Cup-2263","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Character-Cup-2263","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Character-Cup-2263","score":221,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[$BB]黑莓IVY所能访问的真实世界驾驶数据集的规模将比特斯拉的大得多。","the_new_excerpt":"特斯拉疯狂估值的一个重要原因是，特斯拉已经积累了3。\n亿英里的真实世界自动驾驶数据（相比之下，Waymo仅有20\n万英里的真实世界和100亿英里的模拟里程）。) 这使得特斯拉可以\n是目前唯一一家可以培训视觉的汽车企业...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"[$BB]黑莓IVY所能訪問的真實世界駕駛數據集的規模將比特斯拉的大得多。","the_new_excerpt":"特斯拉瘋狂估值的一個重要原因是，特斯拉已經積累了3。\n億英里的真實世界自動駕駛數據（相比之下，Waymo僅有20\n萬英里的真實世界和100億英里的模擬里程）。) 這使得特斯拉可以\n是目前唯一一家可以培訓視覺的汽車企業...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2fcd2f21-4c85-5e90-b056-5e0caa8ba5bc","excerpt":"Hooo boy I just figured out something amazing you dirty apes.
