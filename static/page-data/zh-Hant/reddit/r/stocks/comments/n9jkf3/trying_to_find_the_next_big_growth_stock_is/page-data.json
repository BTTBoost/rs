It seems that each individual small-cap growth stock that is at least remotely known has some cult-like following attached it, convinced it will be the next FAANG.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from some the obvious points, such as small-cap growth being prone to manipulation and pump n dump because of their small market cap, the historical data really shows picking winners is next to impossible. </p>\n\n<p>According to a 2018 quantitative research report from Hendrik Bessembinder, the best performing 4% of listed companies drove the entire returns of the stock market since 1926. The remaining 96% of stocks collectively were outperformed by US Treasury Bills. Statistically, you are likely to be better off not investing your money than you would be taking your chances on 96% of the stock market. </p>\n\n<p>Your odds are even worse when you go hunting for the 1,000+ listed U.S. small-cap growth stocks. You have better chances of finding a needle in a haystack. </p>\n\n<p>I cannot understand how this mindset of &quot;finding the next Amazon&quot; has taken such great hold and now everyone thinks their &quot;DD&quot; is completely infallible if they &quot;believe in the stock&quot; and &quot;hold it long term.&quot; Confirmation bias, survival bias, and the endowment effect have run rampant, and a lot people who do not know what they are doing are going to (or already have) lost a lot of money they cannot afford to lose.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n9jkf3/trying_to_find_the_next_big_growth_stock_is/","title":"Trying to find the next big growth stock is absolutely moronic and a good way to lose money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-11T09:29:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-11 09:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c733c6e2-fd7b-5f1b-bdb1-e08986eaf6ba","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n9jkf3/trying_to_find_the_next_big_growth_stock_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n9jkf3/trying_to_find_the_next_big_growth_stock_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"donemessedup123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/donemessedup123","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"donemessedup123","score":69,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"次の大きな成長株を探そうとするのは、絶対にバカげているし、お金を失う良い方法だ。","the_new_excerpt":"2020年のブルラン以降、ソーシャル、特にRedditでは、投機的な銘柄を深く買おうとする人が増えてきているのを感じています。\n特にRedditでは、投機的な株を深く買おうとする人が増えています。それは\n少なからず知られている個別の小型成長株には、カルト的なファンがついているようです。\nそのような銘柄には、カルト的なファンがついていて、「これはいける」と確信しているようです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"试图寻找下一个大的增长股绝对是低能的，是赔钱的好办法。","the_new_excerpt":"自2020年的牛市以来，我一直看到社会上有一种上升的趋势，特别是在Reddit上。\n特别是在Reddit上，人们希望深入购买投机性股票。这\n似乎每只小盘成长股，至少是远程的\n都有一些类似邪教的追随者，相信它将成为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"試圖尋找下一個大的增長股絕對是低能的，是賠錢的好辦法。","the_new_excerpt":"自2020年的牛市以來，我一直看到社會上有一種上升的趨勢，特別是在Reddit上。\n特別是在Reddit上，人們希望深入購買投機性股票。這\n似乎每隻小盤成長股，至少是遠程的\n都有一些類似邪教的追隨者，相信它將成爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-5478d6e9-f619-591e-bc93-3d067ebebfdd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9flbc/when_youre_desperately_trying_to_sell_your/","title":"When you’re desperately trying to sell your sinking SPY position, but RH won’t let you due to “insufficient overnight funds.”","date":"May 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"沈みかけているSPYのポジションを必死に売ろうとしているのに、RHが「夜間資金不足」を理由に売らせてくれないとき。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"当你拼命想卖出你正在下沉的SPY头寸时，但RH却因 \"隔夜资金不足 \"而不让你卖。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當你拼命想賣出你正在下沉的SPY頭寸時，但RH卻因 \"隔夜資金不足 \"而不讓你賣。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-19cb9272-9b07-5983-8168-3ca102bc46c6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9qxkj/1m_on_gme_shares_lets_ducking_go/","title":"$1M on GME shares - Let's ducking go!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 11, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GMEの株で100万ドル - Let's ducking go!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"100万美元买入GME股票--让我们躲开吧!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"100萬美元買入GME股票--讓我們躲開吧!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-c733c6e2-fd7b-5f1b-bdb1-e08986eaf6ba","previousId":"RedditPost-5478d6e9-f619-591e-bc93-3d067ebebfdd","nextId":"RedditPost-19cb9272-9b07-5983-8168-3ca102bc46c6","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/n9jkf3/trying_to_find_the_next_big_growth_stock_is/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
