The three major indexes are having one of the worst-performing streaks this year, while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fared slightly better.</p>\n\n<p>According to a report released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of job openings in August was 10.9 million, higher than estimates of 9.9 million and the 10.18 million last month. The rate of job openings measured against the total labor force swelled to 6.9% in July, up from 6.5% the previous month and 4.6% a year ago. From an industry standpoint, the rate jumped to 10.7% from 10.2% in the critical leisure and hospitality field, which has suffered the most during the Covid-19 pandemic. Openings rose to 1.82 million, a total gain of 134,000 last month. There are enough job openings to cover the roughly 8.4 million unemployed Americans. </p>\n\n<p>Coinciding with an increase in job openings, in its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, “The deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.” </p>\n\n<p>Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” August was not the report they were looking for. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. </p>\n\n<p>This weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The crackdown in China continues… This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were “urged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.</li>\n<li>Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflare’s was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.</li>\n<li>Weekly first-time unemployment claims came in at 310,000, a pandemic-era low, well below estimates of 335,000</li>\n<li>JP Morgan (JPM) announced it was acquiring Infatuation, a company that owns different websites and apps that guide diners to restaurants in cities around the world from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).
