&lt;p&gt;The Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ticker ARKG) has seen roughly $520 million of outflows in November amid sinking returns. The fund is down 27% year-to-date as investors shun health-care stocks in favor for more cyclical names that perform well during an economic recovery. Even so, the ETF is faring far worse than the broader biotech sector, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index up 10.49% this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARKG is currently trading at $66.38 a share, lower than its level a year ago, before a steep rally that crested early in 2021. The genomics fund has also seen the largest outflows among Ark’s ETFs this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting that typically loyal Ark investors have been bailing on the ETF,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an advisory firm. “The fund’s assets have been chopped in half since February. While I don’t believe the ETF is experiencing some of sort of ‘doom loop,’ clearly the outflows are putting downward price pressure on the underlying holdings and testing the will of remaining fund owners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ETF’s two top holdings, Teladoc Health Inc. and Exact Sciences Corp., have weighed on its performance, with drops of some 45% and 37% this year, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent outflows may be due to investors looking for shorter-term opportunities into the year-end and freeing up cash, said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ark Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood is well-known for prioritizing longer term investments over short-term gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a 5-10 year hold. AI in health care is going to change the way that we can predict, treat and manage the most difficult diseases like cancer, and the Ark fund gives investors access to the companies who are on the cutting edge of that research,” said Jablonski.&lt;/p&gt;

the staggering and sudden Covid-19 recession by implementing unprecedented
monetary stimulus, has been nominated for a second term as chairman of the U.S.
central bank.

&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden made the announcement Monday morning following weeks of speculation that a push from progressives might see Fed Governor Lael Brainard get the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainard instead will be vice chair of the board of governors; she had been widely expected to get a separate vice chair for supervision post, which oversees the nation’s banking system. As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,” Biden said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its “decisive” action in the early days of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank’s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,” a White House statement said. “During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated – in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House statement said the recovery is “a testament to the success of the President’s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s economy back on track.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden said that Powell and Brainard “also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political pressure, and a Covid struggle
President Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers “boneheads” for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation’s banking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation’s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Under Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,” Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden’s agenda.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden’s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief’s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed’s chair and is the country’s first female Treasury secretary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,” Yellen said. “I think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed’s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a “dangerous man” and that she would oppose his renomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can only trust people that you know personally, and even that has its limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that employing morals into finance achieves pretty much nothing, and damages your overall performance as an investor.
I’d rather try to maximize returns, and then use that money to increase the better being of my community on a smaller, more trusted scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s obviously only my opinion, feel free to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

I know that seems like cake, but losing that much of my college money supposed to be spent for food is crazy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m suited up and have robinhood gold. I am able to deposit $10,000 in instant deposits, but have nowhere close to that money in my bank. No matter what y’all retards say, i’m going to do it tomorrow morning and see what happens. Throwing all into $LCID puts because fuck Lucid. Realistically, will this work? What will happen IF i make profits? Will they just take the amount out and i’m left with the profit? Either way, i’m going to it. I have no clue what will happen to me if i lose this money, but, i’m not thinking about losing. Only thinking about drowning in pussy and blue hundreds. I’m tired of eating out of wendys garbage can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short: Using my instant deposit limit on robinhood with not even 30% of the money in my bank. Remember my name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the constant rhetoric that &amp;#39;iNflaTIOn iz TranZuhToRY&amp;#39; and &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1461651190144503808&quot;&gt;no one saw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1461651190144503808&quot;&gt; it coming&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; many companies that have benefited greatly from the increased prices were discounted. Nobody wanted to invest in lumber, freight, and oil because these price hikes were supposed to be temporary. As many are now admitting, inflation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-may-need-to-pivot-to-faster-taper-waller-says-11637336865&quot;&gt;here to stay&lt;/a&gt; and so are the aforementioned companies&amp;#39; sick margins. The catalyst is a great repricing of undervalued companies. *Think Dr. Burry buying Gamestop at $5* We literally have boomer stocks growing revenues and margins at the rates of start-ups (more on that below*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping Rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the decreased labor force and QE, shipping rates have climbed close to 600% over the last year. However, recently they&amp;#39;ve plateaued and haven&amp;#39;t shown any sign of returning to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6v7dj97fdz081.png?width=2474&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7a78e8ce52437c4b66dd9c349bebfd1fa66c019f&quot;&gt;From $ZIM &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these rates are mostly just for freight from the East to the West. Prices are incredibly low if you&amp;#39;d like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/explained-why-the-shipping-container-crisis-will-not-end-soon-7743451.html&quot;&gt;ship the other way&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Shanghai-Los Angeles route was over $10,000 but under $1,300 in the reverse direction in the recent weeks&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending continues to hit &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=19&amp;amp;step=2#reqid=19&amp;amp;step=2&amp;amp;isuri=1&amp;amp;1921=underlying&quot;&gt;all-time highs&lt;/a&gt; and the Port of LA is&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/cargo-ships-queues-pushed-150-miles-from-southern-california-coast-2021-11&quot;&gt; jakkt to the tits in congestion&lt;/a&gt; with over 100 ships queued in a conga line 100 miles south. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/q9hfrdebiz081.png?width=2636&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=844822e0824142df9b8d61f9c22a8f8f55e5a3b2&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q9hfrdebiz081.png?width=2636&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=844822e0824142df9b8d61f9c22a8f8f55e5a3b2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p7qqvzd7iz081.jpg?width=1300&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0b2707167e384e315aa1cd403099073ac1dffc21&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/p7qqvzd7iz081.jpg?width=1300&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0b2707167e384e315aa1cd403099073ac1dffc21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Play&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any shipping company seems mispriced, however, I see the greatest opportunity I see is with $ZIM. &lt;a href=&quot;https://s27.q4cdn.com/416879924/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/ZIM-Q3-2021-investors-call-Final-17-11-2021.pdf&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; the link to their latest earnings. *spoiler: they absolutely crushed it*. I have literally looked at the top 12 largest, publicly-traded shipping companies and this one seems to have the greatest mismatch on price:value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ZIM has one of (if not, the) highest margins of any shipping company in the industry with a 66% EBITDA margin (that&amp;#39;s double $APPL). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it has been their shipping fleet acquisitions, the freight prices, or efficient logistics $ZIM has 18X&amp;#39;d their profit YoY. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ZIM went public in January this year and has averaged a 100% return every quarter. For a &lt;strong&gt;REAL&lt;/strong&gt; company, this is unparalleled. They literally just go up and to the right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ptd3omdjlz081.png?width=2522&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=81cc178b902e40d8a4002aff7948ff657e4d5166&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ptd3omdjlz081.png?width=2522&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=81cc178b902e40d8a4002aff7948ff657e4d5166&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at the top 12 highest market cap shipping companies, $ZIM seems to be the most mispriced. The average PE of the shipping industry is  ~6.9X (nice). While $ZIM trades @ 3.3X. Even if $ZIM were to normalize at the industry&amp;#39;s average, that&amp;#39;s over a 100% return. If you look at revenue, $ZIM brings in roughly 20% of Maersk&amp;#39;s $AMKBY (the largest shipping company by MC) revenue while trading at ~10% of the valuation.  If you were to normalize $ZIM (66% margin) with $AMKBY (41% margin) based upon net profit, you&amp;#39;d expect a 130% return from the current price of $57. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6wve2xa8tz081.png?width=1520&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2e2984facc1c048ebec1529ea691d516ad1161cb&quot;&gt;Comparison across some shipping companies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Next Run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After $ZIM completely destroyed their Q3 earnings ($12.16 vs $8.99 EPS) and announced a market-leading dividend (20% of quarter&amp;#39;s net income with a 4th quarter dividend equal to 30-50% of annual net income), and heavy volume has started coming in over the last few days. People are starting to notice. If we assume a similar profit for Q4, their &amp;#39;21 annual profit is ~$4.5B. We know that based on shares outstanding divided by net income with a 20% dividend is $2.50. This means that their 4th quarter dividend (assumed at the midpoint of 40%) will be $15. At a current share price of $57, you&amp;#39;d basically get &lt;strong&gt;a 26% return just from a single dividend.&lt;/strong&gt;  If you don&amp;#39;t think boomers and pensions that love dividends aren&amp;#39;t going to jump into this stock then go YOLO into some weed stocks (RIP. Long $ROPE). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ZIM&amp;#39;s ex-dividend date is Dec 15th so, if you&amp;#39;d like the dividend (like me) you&amp;#39;d have to get in before that date. If you think the stock will massively skyrocket from dividend investors, here&amp;#39;s the options chain. You&amp;#39;ll notice the most volume taking place at the $60 strike calls. These calls also have the greatest #gamma and could offer a great return with a breakeven price of $62.60. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/187r26jnqz081.png?width=2574&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3f502b943a2717b68a7a813f87e02fb99a2d554&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/187r26jnqz081.png?width=2574&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3f502b943a2717b68a7a813f87e02fb99a2d554&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 shares @ $57.50&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*This is literally my uneducated, unlicensed opinion. Don&amp;#39;t listen to me. You&amp;#39;ll Lose money\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s noteworthy that just because hedge funds own these stock, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they are completely bullish on them in the near term. It&amp;#39;s very possible they are running shorts in the various forms (covered calls, puts, etc) against their own holdings to hedge themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing that stuck out to me here is BKNG&lt;/strong&gt;, which seems  overvalued, given it is trading at a price that is well above pre-pandemic levels and a P/E for this year over 55. Earnings are projected to grow at 130% next year.  That means the company would have about $100 per share in earnings. BKNG has traded very richly for some time, so applying a healthy 25X multiple on earnings, that would project a stock price of $2500 next year. In this market, a p/e of 25 looks pretty low, especially if the company continues to grow revenues quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales for Q3 came in just under $4.7B&lt;/strong&gt;, which puts it on pace to exceed 2019 revenues of $15B in 2022 IF the trajectory continues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BKNG sold off big after its last earnings report, despite the fact they delivered a healthy beat of expectations. The drop is presumably because expectations had grown too high in advance of earnings, on concerns that COVID would impact travel, and on profit taking.  It&amp;#39;s now down over 300 points from its high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting to see the trend reversal that just occurred in the travel sector. AirBnB, BKNG, and Expedia, were all up double digits from mid-August and in the past 10 days, all 3 are down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attractive entry point for BKNG?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be, but I&amp;#39;m betting the stock will retreat further as COVID cases rise due to holiday travels.  I&amp;#39;ll be looking to buy the stock if it dips back to 2,100 again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of your wondering what the hell to do now, I introduce you to a new unsung hero Michael Gayed. Michael has found a way to systemically outperform the S&amp;amp;P 500 by over 3x while taking on less risk and it&amp;#39;s an extremely simple investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone says that triple leveraged ETFs have volatility decay and are not meant for long-term holding. Well guess what, those people are idiots. Let&amp;#39;s look at the data: If you invested in UPRO using this guy&amp;#39;s simple strategy, backtested all the way back to 1928, you would have returned 27% CAGR while the S&amp;amp;P did 9% and by taking on half as much risk (0.6 Sharpe ratio for this strategy vs. 0.3 for buy &amp;amp; hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are simple, if the underlying index closes below the 200 day moving average, you sell. Once it crosses back above the 200 MA, then reenter. That is it. &lt;strong&gt;Investing $10k in 1928 with this strategy would have returned $28 TRILLION (with a T) while the S&amp;amp;P would have returned $39 million.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this works is because of the lack of volatility above the 200 MA, and higher volatility below the 200 MA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the sweet taste of compounding returns my friends because this is a ticket to an early retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Read the damn paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in order to get that $50k I&amp;#39;d be having to sell 50k worth of VTSAX, meaning forfeiting early capital gains. I&amp;#39;ve only been investing for like 2 years, so it&amp;#39;s not that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand how people can exist with a trader mindset. It&amp;#39;s seems like you need to study alot of quasi science, be on social media constantly, do alot of cocaine, and it really just seems stressful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neat thing about reddit is I can look and see when people post their &amp;quot;analysis&amp;quot; of a stock. Which for 99% of reddit, is just a trader saying voodoo witch craft nonsense about enter and exit points, resistance this and that, cutting losses, and special orders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you ask for their portfolio and they have none or its top secret or something. It&amp;#39;s not illegal to share your portfolio you great traders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an average Joe, and I&amp;#39;m not that smart. so I feel really good when I read posts from people who buy a stock like MU, three years ago, at 40-43 a share, and sell it saying they see no future in it. It&amp;#39;s trading at like $83 now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it when I read people saying they bought Uber near ipo at 40 and sold at 32 and say it&amp;#39;s doomed to fail. But Uber is still around, in fact it hit a height of $60 last spring and now it&amp;#39;s $44. You haven&amp;#39;t even given it a chance to grow or become something yet. Like the company is a verb, give it a few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think traders are like fake friends in high school. They&amp;#39;re only around you if you&amp;#39;re cool. Once you&amp;#39;re not cool anymore they abandon you. But traders are onlu a small portion of money for a company a company makes stuff to sell to people and that&amp;#39;s what really draws in revenue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see alot of people talk about the &amp;quot;opportunity cost&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;oppurtuniy lost, &amp;quot; something like that when you&amp;#39;re not trading. Like if I buy something that isn&amp;#39;t moving fast, or something is in the red, it&amp;#39;s better to &amp;quot;cut my losses.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s like... Buying high and selling low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sounds like the exact opposite of what you&amp;#39;re supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;#39;d rather sink with my ship if you&amp;#39;re telling me to always sell the moment my stock goes red. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if I was so foolish as to pick a bad company, I&amp;#39;d rather just take the full loss, rather then death by a thousand cuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I pick companies that make more revenue every year, have increasing dividends, and are medium to large size growth companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m boring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just look at the best performing companies, read their 10k and just invest. My first two companies I bought were Apple and Starbucks, I then bought Nvidia and Realty Income. I bought Pennymac and Weyerhaeuser afterward. I just sorta sit on them. I just hold them and buy more. If I somehow become broke instantly from these decisions then damn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m investing in known companies with easy business models. I like safety and simplicity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m gonna become a multi millionaire with several cars and boats. I just want to make enough money to be the first millionaire in my family, and have my children live of my dividends so they don&amp;#39;t have to work so hard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just seems like people don&amp;#39;t have patience on the internet. And when you take the time to read people who argue about a particular stock, and then for those same people to be proven wrong by time. It feels good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I open a Roth as well? They sound very attractive for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was using a taxable account as a safety net should I need to access some of the money. Also I was hoping to retire at 55 and use this account to bridge me over to my 401k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from my understanding I could open a Roth and take some or all of the principle out at anytime without penalty.  Also this money grows tax free and can be withdrawn tax free at 59.5. So essentially I could start taking the principle out early if I want to retire early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe its best to have a combination of all 3 401k, Roth, Taxable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geeking out about portfolios and studying and backtesting and so on is fun, I know, and I certainly agree that it is important to take the time to design a portfolio that is compatible with one&amp;#39;s objectives and risk tolerance; but, as with many other things, extra effort has diminishing returns and there soon comes a time when your time (heh) and work would be better spent elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case in point: lately I have been obsessing about whether to increase my bond allocation by 5% now or 2/3 years from now as per my initial plan (this has nothing to do with the market being &amp;quot;high&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m just concerned that I might be overestimating a little my risk tolerance), and I spent way more time thinking about this than putting extra work towards a certification that could increase my wages by about &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I... don&amp;#39;t think I have to spell out why this is not the best use of my time and effort. So yeah, it might be worth it to keep in mind that it is suboptimal to overallocate one&amp;#39;s resources towards portfolio optimization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if I know myself, the danger is that I&amp;#39;ll spend the next four months designing and refining the perfect allocation of my time and mental efforts towards my various work and life objectives rather than doing what I am supposed to do... :-)&lt;/p&gt;
