Even if you decide to hold it for the short term and sell at a relatively small profit you will end up paying short gains taxes (US specific).</p>\n\n<p>I get everyone has different investing strategies. However, if you invest in a company it should be because you believe it will grow and be successful in the near future. The best course of action here is to look at the company&#39;s finances i.e. will this company survive for 5 quarters more without doing a share dilution? , is their revenue growing or expected to grow in the near future? cashflow? etc. In addition, you should research their management as it arranges the factors of production, assembles and organizes the resources, integrates the resources in an effective manner to achieve goals, etc. </p>\n\n<p>There are other business-related questions that you should research i.e will their market share increase, will their customer base increase by expanding its product/service range, expanding their operations or is there an expectation for the demand of their product/service to increase in the future? etc. These questions are just a few of many that you should ask yourself before investing in one company. </p>\n\n<p>Eye strain- This one is very important. Please stop looking at the charts or your brokerage account 24/7 because it&#39;s simply a waste of time. This is also dangerous for you as when there is a drop in price it encourages you to sell reacting to market conditions. Set a stop-loss order if you are too worried the share price will fall below your average price. (Unless you’re a day trader)</p>\n\n<p>Taking advice from random people- I’ve been in this and other stock specific subs for years and always read comments from newbies asking and even taking advice from others. Sometimes their advice might be right; however sometimes they aren’t. The chances of them having a bad experience and losing money with the stock you are discussing is high. Be aware and do your research. I have seen too many cases of people taking advice from others and losing large amounts of money in the sub we aren’t supposed to talk about that starts with an W.</p>\n\n<p>Bad Timing- Stop going all-in whenever a company announces a new catalyst (event) or has great news because by the time the market opens the news will be already priced in, just for it to fall down in the afternoon because it&#39;s overvalued. This is how hedge funds take advantage of you.</p>\n\n<p>Finally and most importantly, never ever buy stocks on margin, you will end up in a massive pile of debt increasing in interest every day that you won’t be able to ever repay..</p>\n\n<p>There is a reason banks &amp; brokerages lend you money, use only what you can afford.. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading. Enjoy investing!</p>\n\n<p>Image for Reddit post: <a href=\"https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F1203425526%2F0x0.jpg\">https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F1203425526%2F0x0.jpg</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pysiqp/modern_problems_with_todays_investors/","title":"Modern problems with today’s investors","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-01T14:18:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-01 14:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pysiqp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pysiqp/modern_problems_with_todays_investors/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pysiqp/modern_problems_with_todays_investors/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"InvestorLegend","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/InvestorLegend","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"InvestorLegend","score":53,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"現代の投資家が抱える問題","the_new_excerpt":"今の投資家の問題点は\n\n 1. 一夜限りの大金持ちへの期待\n\n 2. 24時間365日の値動きを見ている\n\n 3. 貧弱なDD\n\n 4. 赤字の日や週を経験するたびに恐怖を感じる。\n\n適切な投資とは、あなたの資金が少なくとも3～5年は技術的にロックされていることです。\n3-5年はロックされています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"当今投资者的现代问题","the_new_excerpt":"今天的投资者的问题是。\n\n 1. 对一夜之间成为百万富翁的期望\n\n 2. 全天候关注价格走势\n\n 3. 可怜的DD\n\n 4. 每当你经历一个红色的日子/星期时，就会感到恐惧。\n\n适当的投资意味着，你的钱在技术上至少被锁定3-5年。\n3-5年。想象一下，如果你没有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"當今投資者的現代問題","the_new_excerpt":"今天的投資者的問題是。\n\n 1. 對一夜之間成爲百萬富翁的期望\n\n 2. 全天候關注價格走勢\n\n 3. 可憐的DD\n\n 4. 每當你經歷一個紅色的日子/星期時，就會感到恐懼。\n\n適當的投資意味着，你的錢在技術上至少被鎖定3-5年。\n3-5年。想象一下，如果你沒有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pyzpp1","excerpt":"2/3rds of China is experiencing extensive blackouts.\n\nThe driving force is a lack of quality coal because they hate Australia layered\non top of a central controlled electricity price and a market price for local\ncoal.
