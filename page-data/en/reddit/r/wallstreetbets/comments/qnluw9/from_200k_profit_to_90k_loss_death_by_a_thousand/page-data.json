I believe it would be theraputic to me to write this out, and I hope some may learn from my mistakes of this year. There was no single yolo gone bad, rather it was the culmination of many mistakes along the way. </p>\n\n<p>It all started with GME. I had an inherited portfolio of around $200,000, all of which was in mutual funds and highly diversified. I got into GME with $40,000 relatively early at $100 per share, at the peak squeeze my $40k turned to 200k, giving me a total of 400k.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the squeeze ended when they turned off the buy button, I ended up averaging down with another hundred shares or so, ended up selling it all at around $70, I was left with around $170k as you can see in the screenshot.</p>\n\n<p>My next meme stock was Microvision. I rode that one from $12 all the way up to the high of $28. During the second MVIS peak of June, I had almost made it back up to $300,000, it then dipped below $20 and never came back. I became married to that stock, I averaged down and just continued to diamond hand into oblivion. It crushed my account. I ended up selling at $11. If I were still holding now, my net worth would be below 6 figures.</p>\n\n<p>After selling MVIS at $11, my average cost had become $15 and I had around a 25% loss. This brought me to around $130k. I bought CLF before the most recent earnings and got a sweet 15% profit from that. Up to $150k. Then I bought TDOC before earnings at $140, but my stop loss triggered at $130 the day after earnings, before it rocketed up to $150 without me. Back to $130k.</p>\n\n<p>I became tantalizingly close to riches with DWAC. I watched the legendary SPAC pump go from $10 rapidly to $15 and beyond, I had a 50k buy order set to trigger at $20, but at the last second, I said &quot;nah this is dumb&quot;, and I cancelled the order. Had I not cancelled it, and held to the peak, I would have over half a million today.</p>\n\n<p>Missing DWAC caused me to FOMO hard. Recently, Black Rifle Coffee went public with a SPAC, I assumed it would do the same as DWAC, you know... conservative pumpers and all that. Ended up losing $10k from that. Down to $120k. </p>\n\n<p>Most recently I went all in on BGFV, bought at $28 and averaged up to $32, watched myself recover to $150k yesterday before a brutal 30% dump. And earlier this morning I got out, because enough YOLOing is enough for me. That was my breaking point. And viola! Thats how I got down to $110k.</p>\n\n<p>From now on, its a diversified portfolio of large caps for me, no more big high risk yolos. </p>\n\n<p>My advice:\nDon&#39;t get married to a stock, if you&#39;re in a clear downtrend, get out. A small loss is better than a big loss.</p>\n\n<p>Set stop losses to lock in your profits, but dont set them too tight during volatile periods such as right after earnings</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t FOMO into retarded stuff. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t average down, average up. </p>\n\n<p>Assume a stock going up will continue to go up, and one going down will continue down, don&#39;t try to time tops and bottoms. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgflip.com/5t4zp0.jpg\">Snapshots of my money throughout 2021</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: Apes, gamblers and degenerates, thank you all for your kind, encouraging and amusing words. I do feel a good deal better after writing this out and letting it out into the world, it felt like a secret shame that was weighing me down and the burden has been lifted. May you all prosper, and none of your stocks go tits up.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnluw9/from_200k_profit_to_90k_loss_death_by_a_thousand/","title":"From 200k profit to 90k loss: Death by a thousand mistakes","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"November 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-06T13:12:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-06 13:12","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qnluw9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnluw9/from_200k_profit_to_90k_loss_death_by_a_thousand/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnluw9/from_200k_profit_to_90k_loss_death_by_a_thousand/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/HNTsq4NjfeTiZqc2G_JcoT-8j0WQqC94SXrNKeFI9mw.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c2e6268e2913f5adb2c870b08eac133a55864b58","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"awesomedan24","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/awesomedan24","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"awesomedan24","score":1355,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"20万円の利益から9万円の損失へ。千の過ちによる死","the_new_excerpt":"私はu/Arcanon1 [/u/Arcanon1]に触発されて、私自身の大規模なの話を共有しました。\nの話をしようと思いました。書き出すことは私にとって治療になると信じています。\n私の今年の失敗から学んでくれる人がいることを願っています。たった一度のヨロコビで失敗したわけではありません。\nむしろ、多くの失敗が重なって...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"从20万利润到9万损失。死于千错万错","the_new_excerpt":"我受到u/Arcanon1 [/u/Arcanon1]的启发，与大家分享我自己大量的\n损失的毛片。我相信把这些写出来对我有治疗作用，我希望\n有些人可能会从我今年的错误中学习。这不是一个单一的yolo变坏。\n相反，它是沿途许多错误的结果。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"從20萬利潤到9萬損失。死於千錯萬錯","the_new_excerpt":"我受到u/Arcanon1 [/u/Arcanon1]的啓發，與大家分享我自己大量的\n損失的毛片。我相信把這些寫出來對我有治療作用，我希望\n有些人可能會從我今年的錯誤中學習。這不是一個單一的yolo變壞。\n相反，它是沿途許多錯誤的結果。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qnppmp","excerpt":"Hey, I'm looking for new ideas to potentially add to my portfolio and was\nwondering what your favorite stocks are for different timespans.
