Every year since I inherited the account, we’ve just taken the RMD and otherwise let the financial advisor handle it, since we have a lot on our plates running a business. This year I decided to start paying attention and the fees that we’ve been being charged are outrageous. The advisor recently rebalanced the account and it looks like we are paying almost $1200 a quarter in advisory fees. Before I write his Dear John letter, I just have a quick question. It looks like the portfolio is currently a hot mess of tickers (roughly broken down into the following, with a sprinkle of cash):</p>\n\n<p>10% IWD\n10% IJJ\n5% IJT\n10% SPY\n7% BWX\n15% BND\n4% VWO\n13% VUG\n17% IEFA</p>\n\n<p>I’m thinking of moving everything to a basic 60% VTI, 40% VXUS setup. Are there any financial consequences I should be aware of to making these move? Consequences meaning, taxable moves in the account itself, not consequences to our personal planning. </p>\n\n<p>Note to lack of bonds: I’m 45 years old, but this account is not our “retirement plan”. Our business has been very successful, continued to be very successful during COVID, and also is located on a large amount of real estate. The business has a very small commercial mortgage but was mostly purchased with cash from the remainder of my inheritance, and has gained considerable value due to consumer demand and our “sweat equity”. We have no personal debt. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p6ywno/firing_my_financial_advisor/","title":"Firing my financial advisor","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-18T21:27:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-18 21:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"cbe400c9-b272-56eb-90b2-4f103654838c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p6ywno/firing_my_financial_advisor/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p6ywno/firing_my_financial_advisor/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"Much2Soon2Relax","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Much2Soon2Relax","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Much2Soon2Relax","score":115,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ファイナンシャル・アドバイザーの解雇","the_new_excerpt":"私は2013年に相続したIRAを持っています（現在の価値はおよそ\n$280k). この口座を相続してから毎年、RMDを取るだけで、それ以外は\nそれ以外はファイナンシャル・アドバイザーに任せています。\n事業を運営しています。今年は、私が支払いを開始することにしました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"解雇我的财务顾问","the_new_excerpt":"所以我有一个受益人IRA，我在2013年继承的（目前价值约为\n$280k). 自从我继承了这个账户后，我们每年都只提取RMD，其他的都让财务顾问去做。\n否则就让财务顾问来处理，因为我们有很多事情要做\n经营一个企业。今年，我决定开始支付...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"解僱我的財務顧問","the_new_excerpt":"所以我有一個受益人IRA，我在2013年繼承的（目前價值約爲\n$280k). 自從我繼承了這個賬戶後，我們每年都只提取RMD，其他的都讓財務顧問去做。\n否則就讓財務顧問來處理，因爲我們有很多事情要做\n經營一個企業。今年，我決定開始支付...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-604f3ed4-92c7-5ccf-b8c7-fe9f48294450","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p6xrzn/warrior_princess_cathie_woods_prepares_for_short/","title":"Warrior Princess Cathie Woods prepares for short attacks","date":"August 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"戦姫キャシー・ウッズ、ショートアタックに備える","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"勇士公主凯西-伍兹为短距离攻击做准备","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"勇士公主凱西-伍茲爲短距離攻擊做準備","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1428045885905199110","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1428045885905199110","title":"Restaurants sue New York City, De Blasio for indoor dining vaccination mandate ***","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 18, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"レストランが屋内飲食のワクチン接種義務化でニューヨーク市、デ・ブラシオ氏を訴える ***。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"餐馆起诉纽约市、德布拉西奥的室内餐饮疫苗接种任务 ***","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"餐館起訴紐約市、德布拉西奧的室內餐飲疫苗接種任務 ***","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-cbe400c9-b272-56eb-90b2-4f103654838c","previousId":"RedditPost-604f3ed4-92c7-5ccf-b8c7-fe9f48294450","nextId":"TweetPost-1428045885905199110","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p6ywno/firing_my_financial_advisor/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
