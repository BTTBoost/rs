Warnings involving phrases like &quot;decaying value&quot; or &quot;daily rebalancing&quot;. However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as &quot;daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days&quot;; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at <em>any</em> point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?</p>\n\n<p>All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term &quot;Beta Slippage&quot;: Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?</p>\n\n<p>To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.</p>\n\n<p>If you aren&#39;t curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>If you are:</p>\n\n<p>I used TD Ameritrade&#39;s API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF&#39;s leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.</p>\n\n<p>Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!</p>\n\n<p>I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uR8sy1O-t1oKGTwjAoeNPXC45L6aT-ZEvMkqINfXfNs/edit#gid=1273321998\">Quantifying Beta Slippage</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mhe419/quantifying_beta_slippage_why_leveraged_etfs_are/","title":"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think)","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-01T06:21:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-01 06:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"75c4650f-42c6-58cc-b439-0e7d1ae95d19","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mhe419/quantifying_beta_slippage_why_leveraged_etfs_are/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mhe419/quantifying_beta_slippage_why_leveraged_etfs_are/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"SorenLantz","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SorenLantz","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SorenLantz","score":58,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"量化Beta滑坡（为什么杠杆ETF没有你想象的那么可怕？","the_new_excerpt":"(结果见下文)\n\n如果你对杠杆ETF有一定的了解，你一定听说过\n围绕它们的许多警告。涉及 \"腐烂 \"等短语的警告。\n值 \"或 \"每日再平衡\"。然而，你和我一样，可能也已经注意到了。\n所有这些警告都是用假设的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"量化Beta滑坡（爲什麼槓桿ETF沒有你想象的那麼可怕？","the_new_excerpt":"(結果見下文)\n\n如果你對槓桿ETF有一定的瞭解，你一定聽說過\n圍繞它們的許多警告。涉及 \"腐爛 \"等短語的警告。\n值 \"或 \"每日再平衡\"。然而，你和我一樣，可能也已經注意到了。\n所有這些警告都是用假設的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1377367857797861382","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1377367857797861382","title":"Lumber prices hit another record high, more than tripling over the last year.\n\nAccording to the Fed, there's no evidence of inflation, and easy money policies must continue for a few more years. https://t.co/zhgO2WCmkq","date":"April 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"木材价格再创历史新高，比去年翻了三倍多。\n\n美联储认为，没有证据表明存在通货膨胀，宽松货币政策必须再持续几年。https://t.co/zhgO2WCmkq。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"木材價格再創歷史新高，比去年翻了三倍多。\n\n美聯儲認爲，沒有證據表明存在通貨膨脹，寬鬆貨幣政策必須再持續幾年。https://t.co/zhgO2WCmkq。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-48c7eeac-45a2-5599-ba2b-d329f8393d68","excerpt":"Apple will begin using Tesla’s batteries at their new solar farm.\n\nThis may lead to a long lasting relationship regarding battery technology.
