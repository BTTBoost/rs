Most of my stock picks have been large cap companies, lots of tech and consumer products. I follow trends, buy the dip, yadda yadda.</p>\n\n<p>About a year ago I started putting extra money into ETFs. For those, I have focused on tech heavy funds, clean energy, next gen stuff- all Vanguard or low cost funds. Now that my portfolio is split evenly between individual stocks and ETFs, I&#39;ve noticed a surprising trend:</p>\n\n<p>My ETFs beat my stock picks almost every day. Today is a great example- in a mixed market, my individual stocks are (collectively) down -$195, but my ETFs are (collectively) up $110. And it is like this fairly consistently. On a good day for the markets as a whole, my ETFs are always beating my stock picks. Sure, there are times I have an individual stock that might pop and outperform my ETFs, but more regularly, my collective stock picks rarely outperform my collection of ETF picks.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I am just saying that I am done trying to pick the next winning stock, spending my valuable time pouring over charts and digging through the news for rumors. I am liquidating my individual stocks and dumping it all back into my ETF picks at the next market dip.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lh2by7/i_am_no_longer_picking_stocks_its_etfs_for_me/","title":"I am no longer picking stocks.
