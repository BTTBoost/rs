This morning I attempted withdrawing my funds from my Robinhood account only to experience two different errors, shown <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/2Ws8qcP\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>One error is about some mysterious additional verification that I need to complete, but with zero ability to initiate that, other than going to their support team. It also suggests the issue is due to the account I was attempting to withdraw to.</p>\n\n<p>So, I tried withdrawing to the other one of my two linked bank accounts, only to receive an &quot;unexpected server error.&quot; The error message suggests trying again later. Well, I&#39;ve tried about 10 different times today and get the same message every time.</p>\n\n<p>It appears to me that RH is making it as difficult as possible for me to move my own money off their shady platform.
