AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries.</p>\n\n<p>Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years.</p>\n\n<p>The most advanced use Intel&#39;s first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands&#39; ASML (ASML.AS) that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,&quot; Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors.</p>\n\n<p>Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like &quot;Intel 7&quot; that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies.</p>\n\n<p>In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in &quot;nanometers&quot;. But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive.</p>\n\n<p>Intel&#39;s first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel&#39;s chipmaking technology but will use Intel&#39;s packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and &quot;chiplets&quot; or &quot;tiles&quot;, often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,&quot; Gelsinger said.</p>\n\n<p>Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a &quot;major mobile platform&quot; and engaging in a &quot;deep a strategic manner.&quot; Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids.</p>\n\n<p>But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the &quot;hubris&quot; of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology.</p>\n\n<p>This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming &quot;Intel 18A&quot; process if it is not ready.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,&quot; Kanter, the analyst, said. &quot;Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by David Gregorio</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/osia3u/intel_to_build_qualcomm_and_amazon_chips_aims_to/","title":"Intel to build Qualcomm and Amazon chips, aims to catch foundry rivals by 2025","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-27T13:16:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-27 13:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5b9a93d1-9033-52ce-89f4-0555b029f91a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/osia3u/intel_to_build_qualcomm_and_amazon_chips_aims_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/osia3u/intel_to_build_qualcomm_and_amazon_chips_aims_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"potatoandbiscuit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/potatoandbiscuit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"potatoandbiscuit","score":201,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"インテル、クアルコムとアマゾンのチップを製造、2025年までにファウンドリのライバルに追いつくことを目指す","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/\n\nIntel Corp (INTC.O) は月曜日、同社の工場でQualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) のチップの製造を開始すると発表しました。\nInc (QCOM.O)のチップの製造を開始すると発表し、新しいファウンドリービジネスを拡大するためのロードマップを示しました。\nまた、新たなファウンドリ事業を拡大するためのロードマップを示した。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"英特尔将制造高通和亚马逊芯片，旨在2025年前赶上代工对手","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/\n\n英特尔公司（INTC.O）周一表示，其工厂将开始制造高通公司（QCOM.O）的芯片。\n公司(QCOM.O)的芯片，并制定了扩大其新的代工业务的路线图。\n赶上台湾等竞争对手...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"英特爾將製造高通和亞馬遜芯片，旨在2025年前趕上代工對手","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/\n\n英特爾公司（INTC.O）週一表示，其工廠將開始製造高通公司（QCOM.O）的芯片。\n公司(QCOM.O)的芯片，並制定了擴大其新的代工業務的路線圖。\n趕上臺灣等競爭對手...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ea4ab0d2-dd83-5f4b-a69e-4dbd860f3680","excerpt":"China’s government bonds and the yuan slid in tandem, amid speculation that\noverseas hedge funds have stepped up liquidating the country’s assets after a\nrout in shares deepened.\n\nThe yield on the most actively traded 10-year government bond rose seven basis\npoints to 2.94% Tuesday afternoon, the…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/osiost/chinas_yuan_bonds_tank_in_tandem_amid_fears_on/","title":"China’s Yuan, Bonds Tank in Tandem Amid Fears on Foreign Selloff","date":"July 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"中国の人民元と債券が連動して暴落、外国人の暴落が懸念される","the_new_excerpt":"海外のヘッジファンドが中国の資産整理を進めているとの観測から、中国の国債と人民元が連動して下落しました。\n株式の暴落が深刻化した後、海外のヘッジファンドが中国の資産を整理する動きを強めているとの見方が出ている。\n株の暴落が深刻化したため、海外のヘッジファンドが中国の資産の流動化を進めているとの思惑から、国債と人民元は連動して下落しました。\n\n最も活発に取引されている10年物国債の利回りは、7ベーシスポイント上昇し、2.\n火曜日の午後、最も活発に取引されている10年物国債の利回りは7ベーシスポイント上昇し、2.94%となりました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"中国的人民币和债券在对外国经济下滑的担忧中同步下跌","the_new_excerpt":"中国政府债券和人民币同步下滑，因为有人猜测\n海外对冲基金在股市溃败加深后加紧清算中国的资产。\n股市溃败加深后，海外对冲基金加紧清算中国资产。\n\n交易最活跃的10年期政府债券的收益率上升了7个基点，至2.5%。\n周二下午升至2.94%，为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中國的人民幣和債券在對外國經濟下滑的擔憂中同步下跌","the_new_excerpt":"中國政府債券和人民幣同步下滑，因爲有人猜測\n海外對沖基金在股市潰敗加深後加緊清算中國的資產。\n股市潰敗加深後，海外對沖基金加緊清算中國資產。\n\n交易最活躍的10年期政府債券的收益率上升了7個基點，至2.5%。\n週二下午升至2.94%，爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7865ff5a-b671-5bd4-8e16-f8a5636b2c59","excerpt":"There's lots of FUD going on right now in regards to Chinese companies, but I've\nbeen wondering this for a while.\n\nFor most companies, when you buy stock you get a piece of that company and it's\nfuture profits.
