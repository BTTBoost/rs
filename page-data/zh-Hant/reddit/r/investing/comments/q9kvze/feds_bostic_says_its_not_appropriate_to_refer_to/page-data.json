He spoke with a glass jar labeled “transitory” at his side, depositing $1 each time he used the “swear word,” as it’s become known to him and his staff over the past few months. </p>\n\n<p>“It is becoming increasingly clear that the feature of this episode that has animated price pressures — mainly the intense and widespread supply-chain disruptions — will not be brief,” Bostic said. “By this definition, then, the forces are not transitory.”</p>\n\n<p>Bostic, who votes on monetary policy this year, endorsed the Federal Open Market Committee’s plans to taper its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases, which is likely to start at its November meeting. In a Q&amp;A with Peterson President Adam Posen, Bostic said U.S. growth and the recovery in employment have exceeded his expectations.</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve adjusted my ‘dot plot’ submissions to reflect much greater growth, much more in terms of jobs and also higher inflation,” Bostic said, referring to the committee’s quarterly interest rate forecasts. “It’s also called me to pull forward some of my thinking about when interest rate liftoff will be. That’s still more than a year off in my forecasts.”</p>\n\n<p>Tapering is unlikely to slow the economy because markets are functioning well and the issues with the U.S. economy are more about supply-chain disruptions from Covid-19 rather than demand, he said in the Q&amp;A.</p>\n\n<p>Bostic’s concern with inflation was echoed by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said he favors starting to taper in November and finishing by the first quarter of 2022 to give the central bank flexibility to raise rates if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>“The story that inflation will come down naturally is a reasonable one, but I only want to put 50% probability on that scenario,” Bullard said Tuesday in a televised interview with CNBC. “I have got to put some probability on a scenario where inflation stays high or even goes higher.”</p>\n\n<p>In his prepared remarks, Bostic said he was seeing signs of a broadening in inflation.</p>\n\n<p>“I believe evidence is mounting that price pressures have broadened beyond the handful of items most directly connected to supply-chain issues or the reopening of the services sector,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>He said longer-run inflation expectations measures have climbed, with many reaching decade highs.</p>\n\n<p>“These upside risks to the inflation outlook bear watching closely,” Bostic said. “Up to now, indicators do not suggest that long-run inflation expectations are dangerously untethered. But the episodic pressures could grind on long enough to unanchor expectations. We will be watching carefully.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>OP: here are a few other choice quotes that emerged last week.</p>\n\n<p>FED&#39;S BULLARD: I WOULD PUT 50% CHANCE ON HIGH LEVELS OF INFLATION PERSISTING</p>\n\n<p>MOYNIHAN - BofA CEO: INFLATION ISN&#39;T TEMPORARY, IT&#39;S PERMANENT</p>\n\n<p>*MORGAN STANLEY CEO GORMAN SAYS INFLATION IS `NOT TRANSITORY&#39;</p>\n\n<p>FED&#39;S BARKIN: IF IT TURNS OUT INFLATION ISN&#39;T TRANSITORY, THERE&#39;S NO SHAME IN SAYING THAT</p>\n\n<p>FED&#39;S BULLARD: NOT A STRONG CASE THAT INFLATION WILL DEFINITELY DISSIPATE OVER NEXT 6 MONTHS</p>\n\n<p>This is all very odd given I received such <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nwmq4r/cpi_rises_6_in_may_rate_of_inflation_rises_to_5/h1at1ku/?context=3\">strong assurances</a>...</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q9kvze/feds_bostic_says_its_not_appropriate_to_refer_to/","title":"Fed's Bostic says it’s not appropriate to refer to inflation surge as transitory","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-16T23:21:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-16 23:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q9kvze","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q9kvze/feds_bostic_says_its_not_appropriate_to_refer_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q9kvze/feds_bostic_says_its_not_appropriate_to_refer_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"pineapplepiebrownie","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pineapplepiebrownie","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"pineapplepiebrownie","score":340,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FRBのBostic氏、インフレ率の上昇を一過性のものとみなすのは適切ではないと発言","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/transitory-is-e2-80-98dirty-word-e2-80-99-as-inflation-lasts-fed-e2-80-99s-bostic-says/ar-AAPqKbz\n\n(Bloomberg) -- アトランタ連邦準備銀行のラファエル・ボスティック総裁は、今年のインフレ率の上昇は政策担当者の予想よりも長く続いている。\n今年のインフレ率の上昇は政策担当者の予想よりも長く続いている。\nそれは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美联储博斯蒂克称将通胀激增说成是过渡性的并不合适","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/transitory-is-e2-80-98dirty-word-e2-80-99-as-inflation-lasts-fed-e2-80-99s-bostic-says/ar-AAPqKbz\n\n(Bloomberg) -- 亚特兰大联邦储备银行行长Raphael Bostic说\n今年的通胀激增持续时间超过了决策者的预期，因此\n它是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美聯儲博斯蒂克稱將通脹激增說成是過渡性的並不合適","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/transitory-is-e2-80-98dirty-word-e2-80-99-as-inflation-lasts-fed-e2-80-99s-bostic-says/ar-AAPqKbz\n\n(Bloomberg) -- 亞特蘭大聯邦儲備銀行行長Raphael Bostic說\n今年的通脹激增持續時間超過了決策者的預期，因此\n它是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q9g9tf","excerpt":"So basically my idea is that turkey is about to have a near worthless currency.\nA few reasons for this are listed below:\n\n * Erdogan\n * Unfettered Immigration\n * EU, USA crackdown\n * Syrian conflict\n * Social unrest\n * Winter\n\nI think we may see the Lira go up to as high as 20 to the USD, what are…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q9g9tf/how_do_you_short_the_turkish_lira/","title":"How do you short the Turkish Lira?","date":"October 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"トルコリラのショートは？","the_new_excerpt":"基本的に私の考えは、トルコはほぼ無価値の通貨になろうとしているということです。\nその理由をいくつか挙げてみましょう。\n\n * エルドアン\n * 自由な移民\n * EUとアメリカの弾圧\n * シリア紛争\n * 社会不安\n * 冬\n\nリラが1米ドル＝20円まで上昇するのではないかと思いますが、どうでしょうか？","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如何做空土耳其里拉？","the_new_excerpt":"因此，基本上我的想法是，火鸡即将拥有一个几乎没有价值的货币。\n这方面的几个原因列举如下。\n\n *埃尔多安\n *不受约束的移民\n *欧盟、美国的打压\n * 叙利亚冲突\n * 社会动荡\n *冬天\n\n我认为我们可能会看到里拉对美元的汇率上升至20，什么是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何做空土耳其里拉？","the_new_excerpt":"因此，基本上我的想法是，火雞即將擁有一個幾乎沒有價值的貨幣。\n這方面的幾個原因列舉如下。\n\n *埃爾多安\n *不受約束的移民\n *歐盟、美國的打壓\n * 敘利亞衝突\n * 社會動盪\n *冬天\n\n我認爲我們可能會看到里拉對美元的匯率上升至20，什麼是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q9jjq1","excerpt":"Personally, I save half of whatever I’m going to invest (50% into a savings\naccount, 50% into whatever investment I’m making).
