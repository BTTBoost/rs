Within minutes domestic movie ticket sites began to crash as moviegoers rushed to snag seats for one of the most anticipated films of the year.  </p>\n\n<p>It is something that the box office has not experienced since the pandemic began and a sign that with the right releases, the movie theater industry has a “bright future,” experts say.  </p>\n\n<p>The pandemic battered cinemas, crushing demand and nearly bankrupting some of the industry’s largest exhibitors. The box office has been slow to rebound, but sustained momentum over the last six months has provided confidence in an eventual recovery.  </p>\n\n<p>Overnight, the latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a co-production between <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS\">Disney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP\">Sony</a>, has sparked even more optimism. Ticketing sites like Atom Tickets, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA\">Fandango</a> and MovieTickets.com alongside movie theater sites like <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMC\">AMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CNK\">Cinemark</a> and Regal saw a surge of demand for tickets leading many to crash or place visitors in hour-long online queues.  </p>\n\n<p>“There are different tiers of intense fan demand when it comes to box office pre-sales, and this film is clearly showing it belongs near the top with a select few others,” said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “For anyone who doubted the communal draw of the theatrical experience over the past two years, look to this enthusiasm for ‘Spider-Man’ as a major inflection point during the box office recovery period and the sign of a bright future ahead.”  </p>\n\n<p>This kind of fervor has not been seen at the box office since 2019 when advanced tickets for titles like “Avengers: Endgame” and “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” went on sale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/spider-man-no-way-home-ticket-demand-crashed-box-office-sites.html\">&#39;Spider-Man: No Way Home&#39; ticket demand crashed box office sites (cnbc.com)</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r5ba4y/sonys_spidermanno_way_home_crashes_movie_ticket/","title":"Sony's Spiderman:No Way Home crashes movie ticket sites","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-30T05:03:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-30 05:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r5ba4y","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r5ba4y/sonys_spidermanno_way_home_crashes_movie_ticket/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r5ba4y/sonys_spidermanno_way_home_crashes_movie_ticket/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"gorays21","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gorays21","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"gorays21","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r526kl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r526kl/gme_yolo_finally_went_for_it_been_selling_csps/","title":"GME YOLO!
