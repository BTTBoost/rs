The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. </p>\n\n<p>After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. </p>\n\n<p>Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they&#39;re still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they&#39;ve trailed for about 14 years, so we&#39;ve had a long underperformance cycle,&quot; he added. &quot;And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. <strong>If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed&#39;s preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting &quot;base effects&quot; as prices rebound after last year&#39;s pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.</strong> More information here <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html</a></li>\n<li>After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. </li>\n<li>Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product&#39;s first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies&#39; platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/\"> Read more here </a></li>\n<li>The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the &quot;Ending Platform Monopolies Act,&quot; which restricts big tech companies&#39; ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.</li>\n<li>Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group&#39;s library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. </li>\n<li><strong>Cathie Wood</strong> and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. </li>\n<li><strong>**Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $161 to $162 at Overweight.
