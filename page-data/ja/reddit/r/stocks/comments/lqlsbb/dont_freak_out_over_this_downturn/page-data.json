I have used the downturn to buy another $20,000 of stocks this morning. Now is the time to buy as the market has given you good deals. </p>\n\n<p>We have good news around the corner. The vaccine is causing a massive drop in infections according to public covid data. By summer there should be enough vaccines for all Americans. </p>\n\n<p>I think that if this happens then there should be a stock market rally. There’s debate where this will be at. Will the rally be mostly the beaten down stocks, will it be the tech stocks will it be covid vaccine stocks. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, don’t freak out too much unless you are on margin you can sit this storm out and put more savings into the market.
