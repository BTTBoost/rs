While $AMC share price has been suppressed in last few days, we just had the announcement today about $AMC share counts. The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.\nI am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.\n- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021\n- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting\n- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares.\nShares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192\n- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm:\nInstitutional Stock Ownership 12.6%\nInstitutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4%\nMutual Fund Ownership 3.2%\nInsider Ownership 6.5%\nOther 67.4%</p>\n\n<p>Total of institution ownership:\n12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2%\nTotal of the rest excluding individual retail investors:\n26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7%\nEquivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners:\n32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares\nShares needed to cover the records:\n-63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M\n- Synthetic shares:\ntotal number of synthetic shares: Z\nnaked shorts: X\nnaked call contracts: Y\nother naked shares: W\nZ = X + Y + W\nShort interest:\nAssuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares\nMinimum number of synthetic shares from public records:\n100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely)\nHidden number of synthetic shares:\nU: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge.\nMinimum number of synthetic shares\n37M + U\n- Bottom line:\n37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC. The ride is still going forwards while it may not be as easy as some of you thought. GLTL.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwskjd/amc_whos_with_me/","title":"AMC.
