I have some cash to invest, so I was wondering whether markets are overvalued and that I should wait, or should I invest right away.</p>\n\n<p>What I did to investigate this was to compare S&amp;P 500 with M2 Money supply. My hypothesis is that the rise that we&#39;re seeing is because of the extra money supply. If that is the case, then the real question we should be asking is <strong>whether market&#39;s rise has overshot the money supply.</strong></p>\n\n<p>From the data, it doesn&#39;t look like so. Take a look at the historical chart of S&amp;500 / M2 money supply.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ctrbC4E\">https://imgur.com/a/ctrbC4E</a></p>\n\n<p>You can play with the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18S9anxRQAD6-865Mrdj6Xyr5DiFifSbef2AlFselWQc/edit?usp=sharing\">dataset here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From the data and the chart, it&#39;s clear that the markets may rise even further</strong>. Reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The ratio reached its peak during the 2000 bubble, and the current levels of the ratio are much below that (although they&#39;re reaching the 2008 levels)</li>\n<li>Since early 2020, M2 Money supply has roughly increased by 24% while S&amp;P has increased by 15%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also interesting to notice that CAGR of this ratio over last 40 years comes to be around 2% which is similar to the annual increase of US GDP.  Another way to look at this is that, the 8% annual returns of S&amp;P 500 over the last 40 years can be broken down into two parts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>6% annual growth in money supply</li>\n<li>2% annual growth in GDP</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, in some sense market&#39;s real growth has been simply the GDP growth.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think about this analysis?</p>\n\n<p>PS: Sorry, the data isn&#39;t very cleanly formatted as I did it very quickly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l1upan/heres_the_evidence_that_were_not_in_a_bubble/","title":"Here's the evidence that we're not in a bubble","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-21T14:59:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-21 14:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3f458e0d-1c76-5a4d-aa72-bb4a88906e47","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l1upan/heres_the_evidence_that_were_not_in_a_bubble/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l1upan/heres_the_evidence_that_were_not_in_a_bubble/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"invertedpassion","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/invertedpassion","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"invertedpassion","score":948,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"这就是我们不在泡沫中的证据。","the_new_excerpt":"你好啊\n\n市场持续上涨，似乎我们处于泡沫之中。我有一些现金\n投资，所以我想知道市场是否被高估了，我应该。\n等，还是应该马上投资。\n\n为了调查这个问题，我做的是比较标普500和M2货币供应量。我的\n假设","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這就是我們不在泡沫中的證據。","the_new_excerpt":"你好啊\n\n市場持續上漲，似乎我們處於泡沫之中。我有一些現金\n投資，所以我想知道市場是否被高估了，我應該。\n等，還是應該馬上投資。\n\n爲了調查這個問題，我做的是比較標普500和M2貨幣供應量。我的\n假設","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-02b576a6-a2f0-5552-9516-81a0007d77a9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1iwru/literally_every_negative_article_about_gamestop/","title":"Literally every negative article about GameStop basically says we pumped the stock and they get paid by “someone” to write it.
