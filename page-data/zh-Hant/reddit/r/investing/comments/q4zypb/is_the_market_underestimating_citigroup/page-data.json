This isn&#39;t without reason however, Citigroup has been through a lot since its 1999 merger with travelers. Right after the merger they became thing big bloated institution that was extremely difficult to control and as a result nearly collapsed in 2008 and had to take the largest government bailout of all the major U.S banks. Since then it has done a lot of work restructuring and making itself a more lean and easier to control institution. However it still lags behind its competitors in share price mainly because while Citi isn&#39;t in danger of collapsing and isn&#39;t as much mess anymore, it hasn&#39;t defined what kind of bank its going to be post restructuring.</p>\n\n<p>Citigroup&#39;s main strength and power is it&#39;s investment &amp; corporate banking arm which has an excellent reputation in wealth management and FX and especially in fixed income trading and debt derivatives, it lags slightly behind in equites trading however that has been catching up fast. The main problem here is its commercial bank which is very global and operates only 723 branches in the U.S. This business model is fundamentally flawed because its way to diversified without any meaningful substance to compete with local players which is why it has been trading so low for so many years.</p>\n\n<p>However now with the new CEO and after many of its old board members got ousted in 2019 it seems to me like a sleeper hit in the banking world. The new CEO is Prioritizing the investment and cooperate banking arm instead of trying to keep the overdiversified commercial bank alive and sold of retail banking units in 13 countries and is focusing those resources into the way more successful investment bank and it doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s stopping anytime soon. In my opinion there are two ways Citi could move forward, either it could divest from many of its unprofitable commercial banking ventures and invest that into making itself an even stronger investment bank, or it could use those resources to buy a major U.S commercial bank to compete with the other 3 megabanks.</p>\n\n<p>Overall while Citi has been a mess in the past and its current share price reflects that. It fails to take into account what Citi could be if this new CEO manages to follow through on the restructuring since the GFC and finally give Citi a sense of direction and identity, so far she&#39;s off to a good start and I think at its current price Citi has great risk/reward. I would love to hear your thoughts on Citi’s future.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q4zypb/is_the_market_underestimating_citigroup/","title":"Is the market underestimating Citigroup?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-11T02:59:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-11 02:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q4zypb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q4zypb/is_the_market_underestimating_citigroup/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q4zypb/is_the_market_underestimating_citigroup/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Ok-Lie-4596","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Lie-4596","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Ok-Lie-4596","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"市場はシティグループを過小評価している？","the_new_excerpt":"シティは米国4大メガバンクの中でPER7.5と圧倒的に安く、さらには\n株の有形簿価である90ドルを下回っています。これには理由があります。\nしかし、これには理由があります。シティグループは、1999年にトラベラーズクラブと合併して以来、多くの経験を積んできました。\n旅行者 合併後すぐに、彼らは大規模な...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"市场是否低估了花旗集团？","the_new_excerpt":"到目前为止，花旗银行是美国四大银行中最便宜的，市盈率为7.5，甚至低于其有形的账面价值，即每股90美元。\n交易价格甚至低于其每股90美元的有形账面价值。这并不是没有\n然而，花旗集团自1999年与旅行者合并以来，已经经历了很多事情。\n旅行者。合并后，他们就成为了大公司。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場是否低估了花旗集團？","the_new_excerpt":"到目前爲止，花旗銀行是美國四大銀行中最便宜的，市盈率爲7.5，甚至低於其有形的賬面價值，即每股90美元。\n交易價格甚至低於其每股90美元的有形賬面價值。這並不是沒有\n然而，花旗集團自1999年與旅行者合併以來，已經經歷了很多事情。\n旅行者。合併後，他們就成爲了大公司。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1447277106585538562","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1447277106585538562","title":"$LUV CANCELS UPWARDS OF 1,000 FLIGHTS SUNDAY DUE TO STAFFING SHORTAGES ###","date":"October 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"$luvはスタッフ不足のため、日曜日に最大1,000便のフライトをキャンセルします ###。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"由于人员短缺，周日LUV取消了超过1000个航班 ###","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"由於人員短缺，週日LUV取消了超過1000個航班 ###","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q5gw1u","excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-10/goldman-cuts-u-s-growth-forecasts-for-2021-and-2022-on-consumer\n\nGoldman now sees 5.6% U.S. growth in 2021 and 4% in 2022\n\nGoldman says consumption, fiscal slowdown are key challenges\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. economists cut their forecasts for U.S.…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q5gw1u/goldman_cuts_us_growth_forecasts/","title":"Goldman Cuts U.S. Growth Forecasts","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 11, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゴールドマン、米国の成長見通しを下方修正","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-10/goldman-cuts-u-s-growth-forecasts-for-2021-and-2022-on-consumer\n\nゴールドマンは現在、2021年の米国の成長率を5.6％、2022年を4％と見ている\n\nゴールドマン、消費と財政の減速が重要な課題と指摘\n\nゴールドマン・サックス・グループのエコノミストは、米国の成長率の見通しを下方修正....","locale":"ja"},{"title":"高盛下调美国经济增长预测","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-10/goldman-cuts-u-s-growth-forecasts-for-2021-and-2022-on-consumer\n\n高盛现在认为美国2021年增长5.6%，2022年增长4%。\n\n高盛称消费、财政放缓是关键挑战\n\n高盛集团经济学家下调了对美国的预测....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"高盛下調美國經濟增長預測","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-10/goldman-cuts-u-s-growth-forecasts-for-2021-and-2022-on-consumer\n\n高盛現在認爲美國2021年增長5.6%，2022年增長4%。\n\n高盛稱消費、財政放緩是關鍵挑戰\n\n高盛集團經濟學家下調了對美國的預測....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q4zypb","previousId":"TweetPost-1447277106585538562","nextId":"RedditPost-q5gw1u","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q4zypb/is_the_market_underestimating_citigroup/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
