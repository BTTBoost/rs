However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.</p>\n\n<p>I am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, not principle like 2008&#39; all over again. The theory behind it would assume that GameStop is a good hedge and to some degree AMC as well, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, german bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short in an edit. It does not mean that my entire portfolio will persist of them, but a decent chunk just in case.</p>\n\n<p>Another hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.</p>\n\n<p>So, in case of this scenario, I would like to get everyone&#39;s opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008 due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall situation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/NDk35Xm\">What people think is going on.</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Since I get downvoted to hell I would like to explain what I think is happening with GameStop. Instead of a discussion, the exact opposite happened here, so I am not really sure why everyone is straight up calling things. I had the same reaction a few months back in a Teamviewer discussion, where I shorted them and everyone called me the most stupid and craziest person on earth inside Discord. Check the ticker, my first and only short in my life.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The theory: The most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and all the shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. So, what I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Think of it like this, a good analogy I found: You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and &quot;pay&quot; the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares. IF this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof as that I can deny that at all.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Computershare confirmed this:Quote from their Twitter: &quot;Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent &amp; therefore does not lend shares in any capacity&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I need to admit I am a bit disappointed by the negative response from a lot of people, but I would like to keep this open and come back one year later, I will simply take all the downvotes from here. I will still read everything and appreciate any opinion on the topic.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Cheers, have a nice week everyone!</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qanhac/hedging_against_a_market_crash_2008_all_over_again/","title":"Hedging against a Market Crash, 2008' all over again","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-18T16:33:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-18 16:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qanhac","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qanhac/hedging_against_a_market_crash_2008_all_over_again/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qanhac/hedging_against_a_market_crash_2008_all_over_again/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"chriizzl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/chriizzl","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"chriizzl","score":74,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2008年の大暴落に備えるために","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。\n\n私は長い間、現在の状況について多くの研究をしてきました。\n最終的には、長期的に100％支持するポートフォリオを構築しました。しかし、私が\nしかし、学べば学ぶほど、私たちはすぐに市場の暴落を経験するだろうと確信しています。\n遅かれ早かれ。\n\n私はここで、市場が暴落するかしないかを議論するつもりはありません。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对冲市场崩溃，2008年 \"重现\"。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n\n我对目前的情况进行了大量的研究，并在相当长的一段时间里\n最后建立了一个我100%支持的长期投资组合。然而，我越是\n我越发确信，我们将很快经历一场市场崩溃。\n而不是迟到。\n\n我在这里不是为了辩论是否...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對沖市場崩潰，2008年 \"重現\"。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n\n我對目前的情況進行了大量的研究，並在相當長的一段時間裏\n最後建立了一個我100%支持的長期投資組合。然而，我越是\n我越發確信，我們將很快經歷一場市場崩潰。\n而不是遲到。\n\n我在這裏不是爲了辯論是否...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1450096781732237318","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1450096781732237318","title":"Tesla Market Cap $TSLA: $844 billion\n\nOther Autos Combined: $827 billion...\nToyota $TM: $244 billion\nVolkswagen $VWAGY: $159 billion\nDaimler $DMLRY: $104 billion\nGM $GM: $83 billion\nBMW $BMWYY: $67 billion\nFord $F: $62 billion\nFerrari $RACE: $55 billion\nHonda $HMC: $53 billion","date":"October 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"テスラの時価総額 $TSLA: 844億ドル\n\nその他の自動車合計：827億ドル...\nトヨタ自動車 $TM：2440億ドル\nフォルクスワーゲン $VWAGY：1590億ドル\nダイムラー $DMLRY：1040億ドル\nGM $GM：830億ドル\nBMW $BMWYY：670億ドル\nフォード $F：620億ドル\nフェラーリ $RACE：550億ドル\nホンダ $HMC：530億ドル","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"特斯拉市值$TSLA: 844亿美元\n\n其他汽车公司合计: 8270亿美元...\n丰田$TM: 244亿美元\n大众汽车 $VWAGY: 1590亿美元\n戴姆勒$DMLRY: 104亿美元\n通用汽车 $GM: 830亿美元\n宝马 $BMWYY: 670亿美元\n福特$F：620亿美元\n法拉利 $RACE: 550亿美元\n本田 $HMC: 530亿美元","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"特斯拉市值$TSLA: 844億美元\n\n其他汽車公司合計: 8270億美元...\n豐田$TM: 244億美元\n大衆汽車 $VWAGY: 1590億美元\n戴姆勒$DMLRY: 104億美元\n通用汽車 $GM: 830億美元\n寶馬 $BMWYY: 670億美元\n福特$F：620億美元\n法拉利 $RACE: 550億美元\n本田 $HMC: 530億美元","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qai7cr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qai7cr/wanna_end_it_all/","title":"Wanna end it all","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 18, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Wanna end it all","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"想结束这一切","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"想結束這一切","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qanhac","previousId":"TweetPost-1450096781732237318","nextId":"RedditPost-qai7cr","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qanhac/hedging_against_a_market_crash_2008_all_over_again/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
