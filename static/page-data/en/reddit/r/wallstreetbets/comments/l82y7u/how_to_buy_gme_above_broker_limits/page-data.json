You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!</p>\n\n<p>P.S. If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY.

You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares.
