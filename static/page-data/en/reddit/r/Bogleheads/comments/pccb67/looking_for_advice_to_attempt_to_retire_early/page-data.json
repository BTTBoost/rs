Very passively invested for a few years and really just got into the goal of retiring early the last couple of months.</p>\n\n<p>I just started a new job where I&#39;ll be hitting the IRA contribution limit within a few years. I&#39;d like to retire in 15 - 20 years (after my mortgage is paid off) with the gains from my taxable account until I hit 60 where I can then leverage my retirement accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taxable account</strong> ($74K) - Been bouncing between dividends and growth and at the moment I&#39;m 80/20 VTI/VXUS. Currently putting in $100 weekly until I finish building my emergency fund and figure out how much additional I can save.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Traditional IRA</strong> ($100K) - From the rollovers from my previous jobs. Currently allocated with dividend stocks with SCHD/VYMI taking 20/10 of the account. Not planning to contribute into this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roth IRA</strong> ($12K) - Neglected this for years. Also 80/20 VTI/VXUS. Plan to max the contributions from now on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>401K</strong> ($0) - Just opened this at my new job with Fidelity. Plan to only contribute 3% to get the employer match. My contributions are post-tax and the employer match is pre-tax. Plan to put all 100% into the FID 500 Index that I&#39;m allowed to choose.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HSA</strong> ($0) - Just started. Plan is to max it out yearly and invest it into probably 80/20 VTI/VXUS.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Any feedback would be appreciated. Really trying to see if my goal to retire in 15-20 years is realistic and maybe see if my retirement accounts are in good shape too.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pccb67/looking_for_advice_to_attempt_to_retire_early/","title":"Looking For Advice To Attempt To Retire Early","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-27T20:31:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-27 20:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8a15aac1-411e-5efc-a28d-3ecd7e5232d9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pccb67/looking_for_advice_to_attempt_to_retire_early/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pccb67/looking_for_advice_to_attempt_to_retire_early/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"hellaquintly","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/hellaquintly","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"hellaquintly","score":18,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アーリーリタイアを目指すためのアドバイスを求めて","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。\n\nちょっと長くなるかもしれませんが、ご了承ください。\n\n私は31歳で、自分が少しでも正しい道を歩んでいるかどうか、皆さんの意見をお聞きしたいと思っています。\n私は31歳で、早期退職を試みることが正しい道であるかどうか、皆さんの意見を聞きたいと思っています。非常にパッシブな\n投資をしていましたが、早期退職の目標を立てたのは最近のことです。\nここ数年は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"寻求建议以尝试提前退休","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n\n对不起，这可能有点长。\n\n我今年31岁，想从大家的集体智慧中获得一些意见，以了解\n我是否在尝试提前退休的正确轨道上。非常被动地\n投资了几年，最近几年才真正进入提前退休的目标。\n过去几年......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"尋求建議以嘗試提前退休","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n\n對不起，這可能有點長。\n\n我今年31歲，想從大家的集體智慧中獲得一些意見，以瞭解\n我是否在嘗試提前退休的正確軌道上。非常被動地\n投資了幾年，最近幾年才真正進入提前退休的目標。\n過去幾年......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-c633a682-fb70-532b-9fa5-e95ef9f4eec5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pculvx/hit_one_milestone_after_30_years_of_investing_in/","title":"Hit one milestone after 30 years of investing in Vanguard. 5 more years to go and I am done.","date":"August 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"バンガードで投資を始めて30年、一つの節目を迎えました。あと5年で終わりです。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"在Vanguard投资30年后达到一个里程碑。再过5年，我就完成了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在Vanguard投資30年後達到一個里程碑。再過5年，我就完成了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-514c89d2-1f93-5851-befe-1d3cc20f0ede","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pcq9a0/summary_of_j_powells_jackson_hole_speech/","title":"Summary of J.
