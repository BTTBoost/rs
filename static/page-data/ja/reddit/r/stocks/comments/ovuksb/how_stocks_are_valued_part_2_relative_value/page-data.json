If you haven&#39;t read it yet, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">start here.</a> This post will go over <strong><em>relative valuation</em></strong>, rather than the absolute value of a company.</p>\n\n<h1>Comparables</h1>\n\n<p>When you&#39;re buying a house, how do you determine what the fair value of the house is? Appraisers often look at similar homes in the neighborhood to get an idea of how much the house should be worth.</p>\n\n<p>If the house on 123 Potato Street were similar to all the other houses on Potato Street but was selling for 20% more than the average, odds are it&#39;s not going to sell. This concept of comparing assets to similar assets also applies in stock valuation.</p>\n\n<h1>How Do We Compare Stocks?</h1>\n\n<p>Remember that stocks just represent a fraction of a company&#39;s future earnings. For similar companies with similar industries, earnings, and, $1 in earnings for company A should be worth the same as $1 of earnings for company B.</p>\n\n<p>A lemonade stand that makes $10 on Potato Street should be worth about the same to an investor as a lemonade stand that makes $10 somewhere else in the same neighborhood. If one is valued at $100 and the other at $120, the first lemonade stand might be undervalued.</p>\n\n<p>There are several metrics we can use to compare stocks. Some ratios include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Price to Earnings (P/E). This ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share. For example, WFC and BAC are (at a glance) similar companies since they&#39;re both in the same industry. It makes sense that they have similar P/E ratios, with WFC at 13.16 and BAC at 12.83. However, we see that BAC is relatively cheaper as we pay less for each dollar of earnings compared to WFC.</li>\n<li>Price to Sales (P/S). This is similar to P/E, except that we compare the stock price to the revenue of a company instead of its earnings. This is good for companies that aren&#39;t profitable yet, since comparing negative P/E ratios seems a bit silly. Uber, for example, has a P/S of 7.40. If we use only P/S to compare Uber to Lyft, which has a P/S of 8.71, UBER seems to be the better investment since we&#39;re paying less for each dollar of revenue.</li>\n<li>Price to Earnings Growth (PEG). This ratio measures the stock price as a ratio to the company&#39;s earnings growth (typically over the next 1-3 years). This ratio is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. For example, if AAPL has a P/E of 28.3x and a growth rate of 1.3%, AAPL has a PEG of 22.6x. MSFT has a higher P/E (35.09x), but because of its higher growth rate of 8.9%, has a much lower PEG of 3.92x.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We can use these ratios (and others) to identify whether stocks are relatively undervalued compared to other similar stocks, or we can compare stocks to the industry average. If we buy companies that are relatively cheaper compared to their peers, we should (in theory) perform better over time.</p>\n\n<h1>Short Term Relative Value Trading Strategies</h1>\n\n<p>We can also make relative value trades in the short term.</p>\n\n<p>A common retail trader’s strategy is to buy a stock for a few days or a few weeks, hoping to scalp a few dollars and turn a profit. However, what if the market drops? Your stock could outperform the market by only falling 3% while the market falls by 10%. You were right but you still lost money due to your market exposure.</p>\n\n<p>Hedge funds also bet on stocks, except instead of looking for a return on a single stock, they bet on stocks going up or down relative to another. They buy stock A and short-sell stock B, hoping A will outperform B. This is aptly named the Long-Short trading strategy or the pairs trade. If A falls 3% but B drops 5%, the hedge fund makes money overall.</p>\n\n<h1>Short Term Relative Value Trade Examples</h1>\n\n<p>How can we apply this to our trading? What if we think GME will outperform AMC? At $161 its may or may not be a good idea to be strictly long GME. However, we can hedge by shorting AMC. If all meme stocks crash, we still make money as long as GME doesn’t fall as much as AMC does. If GameStop stays flat, we make money when AMC falls. (Of course, if you think AMC is the winner you can just inverse the above strategy)</p>\n\n<p>We can apply this strategy to stocks in similar industries such as GM/Ford, Visa/Mastercard, and Coke/Pepsi.</p>\n\n<p>A second example would be a pairs trade I closed earlier last week.</p>\n\n<p>Google has two classes of (publicly traded) shares: GOOGL (Class A) which has voting rights, and GOOG (Class C) which has none.</p>\n\n<p>Theoretically, GOOGL should always be more expensive because they have voting rights, but because Alphabet is conducting share buybacks of GOOG exclusively, GOOGL was cheaper for a while - <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Qng5vyG\">We can see this in the trading view chart here.</a></p>\n\n<p>By buying GOOGL and shorting GOOG, I’m betting the gap between the two stocks will close. I don’t care if the market rises, falls, or goes sideways. I don’t even care if google falls 50%. The only thing I’m betting on is that GOOGL will be the same price as GOOG eventually, and after Alphabet announced it would start buybacks of both share classes, the gap closed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ovuksb/how_stocks_are_valued_part_2_relative_value/","title":"How Stocks Are Valued Part 2: Relative Value","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-01T20:18:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-01 20:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"23dc5bd7-d21c-52c2-869c-c8b1e5b01304","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ovuksb/how_stocks_are_valued_part_2_relative_value/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ovuksb/how_stocks_are_valued_part_2_relative_value/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ArchegosRiskManager","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ArchegosRiskManager","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ArchegosRiskManager","score":80,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"株式の評価方法 第2回：相対評価","the_new_excerpt":"前回の記事では、ディスカウント・キャッシュフローに基づいて株式を評価する方法をご紹介しました。\nの割引キャッシュフローに基づいて株式を評価する方法を説明しました。まだお読みになっていない方はこちらからどうぞ。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]\n今回の記事では...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"股票是如何估值的第二部分：相对价值","the_new_excerpt":"在我的上一篇文章中，我介绍了如何根据公司的折现现金流来评估股票价值。\n的现金流。如果你还没有阅读，请从这里开始。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]\n这篇文章将介绍...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"股票是如何估值的第二部分：相對價值","the_new_excerpt":"在我的上一篇文章中，我介紹瞭如何根據公司的折現現金流來評估股票價值。\n的現金流。如果你還沒有閱讀，請從這裏開始。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]\n這篇文章將介紹...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-076be7f1-67a0-50c6-b545-aa26b1c07e87","excerpt":"AVERAGE MONTHLY RETURN 1980 -
