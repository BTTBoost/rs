It’s not a lot since I only place money on them whenever I have some extra to spare. Diversifying my portfolio is currently my goal and right now I’m thinking of investing in lithium or copper.</p>\n\n<p>With lithium I’m planning to focus on having Albemarle (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALB/\">ALB</a>). They are one of the largest providers of lithium for batteries that power electric vehicles. They have solid earnings, even though the market seems still pretty volatile.</p>\n\n<p>Copper is also currently really volatile too, so I’m only thinking of placing some in <a href=\"http://www.southerncoppercorp.com/\">Southern Copper Corporation</a> (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCCO/\">SCCO</a>). I chose a company that pays a dividend, and in their case they pay a dividend of $2.70 per share. I feel like they are a safe choice to invest in. Also thinking of FCX or FTCO.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to explorations (I know they’re risky but there’s some potential) I lean more towards <a href=\"https://www.solarisresources.com/\">Solaris Resources</a> (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/\">SLSSF</a>). They’re already drilling and there’s some strong profit potential if they continue to show good results. They recently started their maiden drilling at the Warintza South target, targeting the 4th major copper discovery.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a lot since I’m a little cautious about going all out because of the current situation. I just want to diversify my portfolio and these are the ones I’m thinking of putting my money on.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qq1153/is_it_still_good_to_invest_in_metals/","title":"Is it still good to invest in metals?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-09T11:57:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-09 11:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qq1153","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qq1153/is_it_still_good_to_invest_in_metals/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qq1153/is_it_still_good_to_invest_in_metals/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TessaRozier","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TessaRozier","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TessaRozier","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"金属への投資はやはり良いのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"昨年来、私は主に金と銀に投資しています。大した額ではありませんが\n金と銀に投資しています。\n今の目標はポートフォリオの多様化で、今考えているのは\n今考えているのは、リチウムか銅への投資です。\n\nリチウムについては、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"投资金属仍然好吗？","the_new_excerpt":"自去年以来，我主要投资于黄金和白银。这并不是一个\n因为我只是在有多余资金的时候才把钱放在上面。\n使我的投资组合多样化是我目前的目标，现在我正在考虑\n投资于锂或铜。\n\n对于锂，我打算将重点放在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資金屬仍然好嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"自去年以來，我主要投資於黃金和白銀。這並不是一個\n因爲我只是在有多餘資金的時候才把錢放在上面。\n使我的投資組合多樣化是我目前的目標，現在我正在考慮\n投資於鋰或銅。\n\n對於鋰，我打算將重點放在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qpnq0v","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpnq0v/what_its_like_investing_in_tesla/","title":"What it's like investing in Tesla","date":"November 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テスラへの投資はどんなものか","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"投资特斯拉是什么感觉","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資特斯拉是什麼感覺","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qq1153","previousId":"RedditPost-qpnq0v","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qq1153/is_it_still_good_to_invest_in_metals/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
