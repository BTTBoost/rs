&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s think logically: How can general motors stock be 90b and Tesla&amp;#39;s stock be 1T. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say they eventually sell as many cars as Toyota (400b Market cap), their current valuation is still 2x this, and they aren&amp;#39;t even close to Toyota&amp;#39;s production level and probably won&amp;#39;t be for the next 5+ years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toyota&amp;#39;s production for 2021: 10 million cars &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s production for 2021: 627,350&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means Toyota will produce 16x more cars this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is: 
If you were me would you dump Tesla stock?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Toyota will make 16x more cars this year, but its market cap is only 40% of Tesla&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit/Additional Note: I feel like many people are not considering the fact that all major vehicle companies will eventually adapt to fully electric vehicles on par with Telsa. Some car companies may go broke and be replaced with new EV based companies, however the big dogs like Toyota and GM will eventually catch up to Tesla. This is basic common sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telsa, Nio, and Rivian are first movers but they dont have as big of a moat as people think.&lt;/p&gt;

This sentiment holds especially true in the current age of crypto mania, meme stocks, and Robinhood retail investors. Here’s my question for my fellow Bogleheads: How do you approach discussions/debates with people who insist that they are great stock pickers and/or day traders?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, I find it better to not engage at all, especially since everybody has a different “investment” goal and is free to spend their money however they want. However, I do find it difficult to not engage with folks who are clearly full of crap (e.g. someone who claims they are making 10% weekly returns) or folks who are offering stock tips/advice to people you are close to (e.g. a sibling’s friend convincing him to trade options). In other words, what’s a polite way to tell these “geniuses” that they they’re not as smart as they think they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterday’s US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some key numbers for today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (AAPL): +1.75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target (TGT): -4.73%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core Retail Sales: +1.6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing Production: +1.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Wieting, Citigroup’s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, “The markets generally are looking at it [the pace of inflation], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct – it’s benign for markets. It doesn’t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Target (TGT) and Lowe’s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target (TGT)&lt;/strong&gt;: “With a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,&amp;quot; said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowe’s (LOW):&lt;/strong&gt; “Our momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management”, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The party seems over… after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I’d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CME Group (CME) the world&amp;#39;s largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity&quot;&gt;https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company&amp;#39;s Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US. &lt;/li&gt;

I was such a beginner, I had to watch a step-by-step yt video on how to use the Vanguard website. I was worried that I had waited too long to invest, but I persisted and set up my account so I would dollar cost average and start investing in ETFs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic I got married and moved to a new city so I really kinda forgot about my investments until my husband said he wanted to start investing too, but was wary about doing so because he didn&amp;#39;t know what the right timing was. Because of this place, I was able to explain to him why it&amp;#39;s time IN the market not timing the market, and help him understand investment language, set up his account, and choose his portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, thank you for helping me help another investor. Without this place, I would still be thinking investing was only for wallstreet bros and rich people.&lt;/p&gt;

The activity on the account shows shares bought and sold in various companies and ETFs, almost daily (and several transactions in a day). I forgot the exact performance numbers, but account growth was under 20% compared to 23% in QQQ during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The asset manager claims that the account has much less risk so it&amp;#39;s all good etc. Also, he said there is no fee on the trades - they&amp;#39;re all fee-free. He claims the performance is already in the ballpark and will only get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder of course about a number of things about all this, but mainly it&amp;#39;s the frequent trades. What advantage does the asset manager get from trading frequently assuming they are fee-free? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The third quarter was outstanding, with record revenue,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also issued a bullish forecast for revenue in the current quarter ending in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nvidia said it expects to report around $7.4 billion in the current quarter, ending in January, higher than analyst expectations of $6.86 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I put $500 into AMC back in 2020 hoping for a 6-7x return in 1 - 2 yrs. As luck would have it, this became one of the meme stocks and it shot up to $70. Excited to be part of the movement, I hung on, joined the AMC stock forum and stayed in as it dipped back down and down. But it&amp;#39;s just gotten to a point where it doesn&amp;#39;t make responsible sense for me to keep it anymore in hopes of another price surge up to $60 and beyond, when the last few months&amp;#39; price surges only go up ~$40 and I&amp;#39;m sitting on ~14x and have real life bills to pay, including a major medical bill. So, I bit today&amp;#39;s price surge past $40 and sold, I know it was the responsible thing to do - but damn this hurts. Really wanted to be a part of the next a-p-e nation win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: so i posted here bc i figured the other forums would hate on me for selling.  I know this was the responsible thing to do, but it would&amp;#39;ve been nice to hang in there with the rest of a-p-e nation - but don&amp;#39;t have the extra $$ to be doing that right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit 2: want to add, despite my decision to sell, i think this whole memestock phenomenon is so cool and when i&amp;#39;m old with grandkids, it&amp;#39;ll be cool to look back and say that I was a part of it even for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford owns 102 million shares (it should sell them sharpish at this price) worth an incredible $17.5 billion in Rivian that has sold a couple of hundred cars to employees to date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not absurd at all. I mean Rivian had a massive 13,000 orders at end of 3Q (giggle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously wonder how many Rivian investors know that Ford has a massive stake.  I hope it sells it very soon as a Ford shareholder.  Those funds can quickly be put to use massively outselling Rivian in BEV&amp;#39;s by even larger multiples in 2022, 2023, 2024....(basically forever).&lt;/p&gt;

With shares hovering around record highs, it will take a blockbuster report to move the needle for investors. Nvidia stock rose 0.6% to $302.03 in Tuesday trading. Shares surged earlier this month as investors bought in on hype surrounding Nvidia’s financial prospects amid billions in investment, most notably from Facebook ‘s newly rebranded parent Meta Platforms (FB), to build a theorized next phase of the internet called the metaverse. Not even renewed scrutiny in the U.K. related to its proposed acquisition of chip designer Arm could stop the graphics card stock’s 131% year-to-date run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter, analysts polled by FactSet forecast adjusted earnings of $1.11 a share and sales of $6.82 billion. The earnings report or outlook may need to be a blowout for the stock to continue rising. Though 34 of the 43 analysts listed by FactSet have Buy or equivalent ratings, the stock’s mean price target is $280.70. Bullish analysts will either need to raise their targets or downgrade the stock if shares hold above their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

This rumor started because Canoo moved its headquarter to Bentonville, the home of Walmart headquarters. Canoo also teased during its earnings call that it will be building some prototypes for an unnamed partner, which of course the internet jumped on the idea that it must be Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little skeptical of this, since Walmart already has other car partners like Ford and Gatik. Does it make sense to add Canoo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thesis is that Canoo is a decent speculative stock even if it doesn&amp;#39;t have this Walmart deal. There&amp;#39;s lots of other tailwinds such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The infrastructure bill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canoo fills a niche that&amp;#39;s not directly competitive against Rivian or Tesla (and definitely not Lucid). For example Canoo would be great for local governments and schools which will be forced to go green and would like vehicles with low maintenance costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is hungry for EV stock right now. And at sub $20 this is something people can feel good throwing a few bucks in and hold for years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worried that Canoo doesn&amp;#39;t manufacture it&amp;#39;s own vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canoo already had one hyped up story with the acquisition talks with Apple. If this Walmart thing go south investors will &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hate Canoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible discussion topics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; possible reasons to move to Bentonville? Perhaps that city offer huge incentives not seen elsewhere, or maybe it&amp;#39;s actually a great hub of manufacturing. Anyone in that area know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does Canoo stack up against other EV &amp;quot;hype&amp;quot; stocks right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I bought some Canoo this morning, and I kinda like their aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something here? I used to be an avid gamer myself. But my current age I dont have the mental or physical will power to play a game when I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just tired as hell. Its been a drag for my significant other, since we were both avid gamers together.  But its just the reality.. I&amp;#39;m way too tired to play anything on the weekends. Luckily, I just spectate whatever she&amp;#39;s playing and I guess I get my gaming fix there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question remains though. I know my anecdotal experience isnt going to be very useful but I&amp;#39;m just wondering how everybody else feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the FB meta video, all +1 hour of it, and I just thought.. wow. Who would want to be logged into a video game with that shit on your face for multiple hours??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just me? Am I just an old fart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also vaguely reminds me of the 3d movies phase as well. Everybody thought we&amp;#39;d be lining up to see these 3d movies forever but people quickly got tired of that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEY POINTS&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon has told some customers that, from Jan. 19 onward, the company will no longer accept Visa credit cards issued in Britain.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The e-commerce giant cited high fees charged by the payment processor.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visa said it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; plans to stop accepting payments made via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/V&quot;&gt;Visa&lt;/a&gt; credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The e-commerce giant has told some customers that, from Jan. 19 onward, the company will no longer accept Visa credit cards issued in Britain ” due to the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa shares fell 2.5% in U.S. premarket trading.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visa earlier this year hiked the interchange fees it charges merchants for processing digital transactions between the U.K. and the European Union.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Brexit, an EU cap on interchange fees no longer applies in the U.K., allowing card networks to raise their charges.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastercard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;has also increased its U.K.-EU interchange fees.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon customers were told they will still be able to use debit cards — including those issued by Visa — and non-Visa credit cards like Mastercard and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Express&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Users are being encouraged to update their default payment method ahead of the changes.&lt;/strong&gt; The news was first reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-will-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-u-k?srnd=technology-vp&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa said it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“U.K. shoppers can use their Visa debit and credit cards at Amazon U.K. today and throughout the holiday season,” a Visa spokesperson told CNBC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a long-standing relationship with Amazon, and we continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon U.K. without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon blasted Visa for its high card charges. “The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers,” a spokesperson for the company told CNBC.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move could be viewed as a way for Amazon to get some bargaining power over Visa to lower its fees. The payments firm also charges businesses scheme fees to become part of its network.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While smaller retailers aren’t in a position to negotiate, Amazon — given its size — may have better luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/amazon-to-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-uk.html&quot;&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE&quot;&gt;Visa is down about 5%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking into three stocks which includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fortitudegold.com/&quot;&gt;Fortitude Gold&lt;/a&gt; (FTCO). They are a small producer but a good thing about them is that they have no debts. They recently increased their dividend by 14%, and reported positive results in their Golden Mile property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.threevalleycopper.com/&quot;&gt;Three Valley Copper&lt;/a&gt; (TVC) since they’re showing great potential too. They announced a financing with a deal brought about by investor demand, financing the company with $16 million dollars. They are expected to start mining early 2022 and will potentially produce 13-16 thousand tonnes of copper cathodes in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

Rivian is not just a car company, it&amp;#39;s a clothing company too.(&lt;del&gt;Tsla is not just a car company, it&amp;#39;s a technology company too&lt;/del&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have LCID who is up 23% today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RVN who is up 15% today and with a market cap of almost $150B. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others like GOEV, FSR, XPEV, PTRA who have been outperforming most of the market recently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit, TSLA is at $1T valuation and won’t stop there most likely. Yes, yes, I know Tesla is NoT jUsT aN EV cOmPaNy. But still. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is, what is the hype with EV stocks? I understand that it is a rapidly growing industry since mandates and adoption will allow EVs to replace ICE vehicles in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, automaker margins are freaking terrible. I just don’t see the appeal of auto maker stocks going up just because they are going EV. There will be lots of competitors (obviously), beit the new companies like Lucid, Rivian, and Tesla and the legacy makers like Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. Also, it’s not like EV is some niche field where duopolies or monopolies will thrive either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also not mention that EVs will cost more to make when compared to ICE. So it’s not like auto makers are going to cut major costs like when Ford introduced the assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just want to start a discussion and hear people’s thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, I’m not shorting or buying puts. Just genuinely surprised that this EV bubble or rally - whatever you want to call it - is still going strong. Especially in times of inflation fears.&lt;/p&gt;

So when the market is closed on a weekend which makes me concerned he is changing the head and replacing Powell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than rates, covid spike, inflation… my biggest concern was by far a change in Powell because the market hates change and unexpected news. I could totally see this resulting in what should have probably already happened with a correction especially with big market cap stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the new chair would be Brainard who has a major supporter in Senator Warren, who opposes the FAANG stock dominance. I am very concerned and hopefully he just sticks with Powell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market is going so well this would really be the biggest negative that would sink things for end of year&lt;/p&gt;
