While no one can predict future returns, there are a lot of warnings and indicators of a correction at best and a crash at worst coming.  Just out of curiosity I decided to pit some aggressive portfolios against some more conservative portfolios.  Using Large Cap US stocks and intermediate bonds I compared a 50/50 stock bond portfolio, and 70/30, and a 100% stock portfolio starting in 1998 in the lead up before the .com bust all the way to today, this would include the 2008 mortgage backed security crash.  This assumed an initial investment of $200k which is about what I currently have invested, and monthly contributions of $1800, which is about what I contribute.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the 100% portfolio won with a grand total of $3,503,724.  The 70/30 came second with  $2,903,010.  And the 50/50 came last with $2,463,286.  No surprises there, what I did find surprising is that the 100% stock portfolio was neck and neck with both the 70/30 and the 50/50 until the beginning of 2017.  Only in the last 4.5 years did 100% stocks begin to overtake a portfolio that was 54% less risky.  Standard deviation for the 50/50 portfolio was 7.27% while the 100% stock allocation was 15.27%.  Even more interesting for me was that during the Covid crash of 2020 the 50/50 and the 70/30 portfolio turned down only slightly, while the 100% portfolio took a nose dive to the point that it was once again even with the other two conservative portfolios.</p>\n\n<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make is, I know the standard logic is to pick an asset allocation and stick with it, and to take on more risk when young and only begin to taper off risk when approaching retirement age.  But looking at this data I see a strong case to be made, certainly not to exit the market entirely, but to become more defensive when troubled waters seem imminent.  The losses incurred by becoming more defensive and being wrong seem minimal.  I don&#39;t believe this is the same trying to time the market, I see no problem with taking profits off the table and being slightly more cautious when red flags start popping up.  Your thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pmolgp/may_i_make_the_case_against_being_so_aggressive/","title":"May I make the case against being so aggressive?","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"September 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-12T12:34:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-12 12:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pmolgp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pmolgp/may_i_make_the_case_against_being_so_aggressive/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/pmolgp/may_i_make_the_case_against_being_so_aggressive/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"LCDJosh","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/LCDJosh","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"LCDJosh","score":99,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"積極的な発言は控えた方がいいのでは？","the_new_excerpt":"ポートフォリオビジュアライザーでいくつかのシナリオを実行しています。誰も将来のリターンを予測することはできませんが\n将来のリターンを予測することはできませんが、良くても調整、悪くても暴落を示す多くの警告や指標があります。\n指標があります。興味本位で、いくつかの積極的なポートフォリオと、より保守的なポートフォリオを比較してみることにしました。\n積極的なポートフォリオと、より保守的なポートフォリオを比較してみました....","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我可以提出反对如此激进的理由吗？","the_new_excerpt":"在投资组合显示器上运行一些方案。虽然没有人能够预测\n未来的回报，但有很多警告和指标表明，最好的情况是调整，最坏的情况是崩溃。\n最好的情况是调整，最坏的情况是崩溃。只是出于好奇，我决定将一些激进的投资组合与一些更保守的投资组合进行对比。\n激进的投资组合与一些更保守的投资组合....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我可以提出反對如此激進的理由嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"在投資組合顯示器上運行一些方案。雖然沒有人能夠預測\n未來的回報，但有很多警告和指標表明，最好的情況是調整，最壞的情況是崩潰。\n最好的情況是調整，最壞的情況是崩潰。只是出於好奇，我決定將一些激進的投資組合與一些更保守的投資組合進行對比。\n激進的投資組合與一些更保守的投資組合....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1436924721921146880","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1436924721921146880","title":"MOST VACCINATED STATE IN AMERICA, VERMONT, COVID CASES +10,000% YOY https://t.co/OTGoI9qxen","date":"September 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"アメリカで最もワクチンを接種している州、バーモント州、コヴィド感染者数は前年比10,000%増 https://t.co/OTGoI9qxen","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国接种疫苗最多的州，佛蒙特州，科威德病例同比增长10,000% https://t.co/OTGoI9qxen","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國接種疫苗最多的州，佛蒙特州，科威德病例同比增長10,000% https://t.co/OTGoI9qxen","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pml6yw","excerpt":"I came across this article from JL Collins, suggesting that International\nexposure is already built into VTI, so there's no need to invest in a separate\nInternational index fund.\n\nhttps://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/09/26/stocks-part-xi-international-funds-2/\n\nI realize this goes against the 3 fund…","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pml6yw/is_vxus_necessary/","title":"Is VXUS Necessary?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 12, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"VXUSは必要ですか？","the_new_excerpt":"私はJL Collinsの記事を見つけました。\n海外へのエクスポージャーはVTIにすでに組み込まれているので、個別に海外のインデックスファンドに投資する必要はない。\nインターナショナル・インデックス・ファンドに投資する必要はありません。\n\nhttps://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/09/26/stocks-part-xi-international-funds-2/\n\nこれは3ファンドに反することだと思いますが...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"VXUS是否有必要？","the_new_excerpt":"我看到了这篇来自JL Collins的文章，建议将国际投资纳入VTI。\n的风险已经包含在VTI中，所以没有必要单独投资于一个\n国际指数基金。\n\nhttps://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/09/26/stocks-part-xi-international-funds-2/\n\n我意识到这违背了3个基金...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"VXUS是否有必要？","the_new_excerpt":"我看到了這篇來自JL Collins的文章，建議將國際投資納入VTI。\n的風險已經包含在VTI中，所以沒有必要單獨投資於一個\n國際指數基金。\n\nhttps://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/09/26/stocks-part-xi-international-funds-2/\n\n我意識到這違背了3個基金...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pmolgp","previousId":"TweetPost-1436924721921146880","nextId":"RedditPost-pml6yw","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pmolgp/may_i_make_the_case_against_being_so_aggressive/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
