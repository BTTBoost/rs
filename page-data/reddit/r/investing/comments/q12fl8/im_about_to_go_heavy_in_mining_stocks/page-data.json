Got myself invested in some physical gold and silver, but right now that I have some little extra that I have right now, and I’m planning on putting a part of it into mining stocks. I’m still adding some physical, but I’ve been looking into some stocks recently that I want to invest in.</p>\n\n<p>I’m planning to invest in Newmont (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NEM/\">NEM</a>) because they’re among the biggest so it’s pretty safer and sure to invest in them. When big money returns to this sector, they always begin with the miners in the big indexes. Also thinking of placing some on Freeport-McMoran (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FCX/\">FCX</a>) which is a great value stock, with it being one of the bigger players in mining. Their stocks have risen 1.16% in premarket trading.</p>\n\n<p>Also looking into juniors like Lundin Gold (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/lug.to/\">LUG.TO</a>). They own the <a href=\"https://www.lundingold.com/en/fruta-del-norte/project-overview/\">Fruta Del Norte</a> gold mine, and while there was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, they managed to have a production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://collectivemining.com/\">Collective Mining</a> (<a href=\"https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/TSXV-CNL/?utm_campaign=single-quote&amp;utm_medium=widget_new&amp;utm_source=collectivemining.com\">CNL</a>) who recently released results on about their recently discovered a high-grade silver channel sampling that they started drilling a few weeks ago. It is expected that their next results could be a bigger catalyst than their previous discovery. They are showing a lot of potential as the drillings continue. One more good thing about them is that their cash burn is also impressively low.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like mining stocks would be a good option to diversify my assets and investments, but I’m still looking into what to invest on. I want to diversify my portfolio so I really need your thoughts. What stocks are the best to invest in right now?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q12fl8/im_about_to_go_heavy_in_mining_stocks/","title":"I’m about to go heavy in mining stocks","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-04T11:30:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-04 11:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q12fl8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q12fl8/im_about_to_go_heavy_in_mining_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q12fl8/im_about_to_go_heavy_in_mining_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Eloqpolma","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Eloqpolma","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Eloqpolma","score":108,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"鉱山株で重い腰を上げようとしている","the_new_excerpt":"私は以前から、いくつかの現物に投資してきました。\nコモディティとアセットの時代になると信じているからです。金や銀の現物にも投資しています。\n金や銀の現物にも投資していますが、今はまだ少し余っているので\nしかし、今、少しだけ余っているので、その一部を・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我准备重仓买入矿业股","the_new_excerpt":"我已经在一些实物上投资了一段时间，因为我相信\n这将是商品和资产的时期。我自己投资了一些\n实物黄金和白银，但现在，我有一些额外的东西，我现在有\n我现在有一些多余的钱，我打算把其中的一部分投入到......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我準備重倉買入礦業股","the_new_excerpt":"我已經在一些實物上投資了一段時間，因爲我相信\n這將是商品和資產的時期。我自己投資了一些\n實物黃金和白銀，但現在，我有一些額外的東西，我現在有\n我現在有一些多餘的錢，我打算把其中的一部分投入到......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q0xc62","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q0xc62/every_week_day/","title":"Every Week Day","date":"October 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"毎週曜日","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"每个星期的日子","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"每個星期的日子","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q0omot","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q0omot/mortgage_payments_havent_been_this_unaffordable/","title":"Mortgage Payments Haven’t Been This Unaffordable Since 2008","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 04, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2008年以降、住宅ローンの支払いがこれほど困難になったことはない","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"自2008年以来，抵押贷款支付从未如此难以负担得起","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"自2008年以來，抵押貸款支付從未如此難以負擔得起","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q12fl8","previousId":"RedditPost-q0xc62","nextId":"RedditPost-q0omot","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q12fl8/im_about_to_go_heavy_in_mining_stocks/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
