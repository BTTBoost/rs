Buying over-valued things is a bad idea. Go over to personal finance and look at people asking &#39;Should I buy a car now or wait.&#39; Everyone says: &#39;Wait. Cars are overvalued. Wait if you can.&#39; They do not say: &quot;No one know if the price of cars will go up or down, you might as well DCA a car now.&quot; In general we avoid buying over-priced things. I&#39;m not even convinced JB himself would buy the market at this price. </p>\n\n<p>So my brain says: I am going to wait to buy more stock until it is less expensive. I am going to pull out my money right now and buy back in when stock is less expensive and bonds rates are better. At the low rate of return from bonds, and the expected poor return on stocks if valuations don&#39;t fall, I&#39;m not even sure returns justify the risk vs cash (even taking inflation in account).</p>\n\n<p>I know that I will probably not correctly time the trough, but I believe very strongly in reversion to the mean, and both stocks and bonds have to revert in a way that will cause their value to fall relative to present.</p>\n\n<p>If I buy later when things are cheaper, how do I lose money in the meantime? Is the sole explanation that perhaps the market will never dip lower than the point at which I pull out? </p>\n\n<p>Sorry, I know this will ruffle some feathers here, but I value this forums opinion a lot. Thanks in advance</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p2fs7p/eli5_how_do_i_lose_money_by_timing_the_market/","title":"ELI5: how do I lose money by timing the market","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-11T21:22:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-11 21:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"66063744-382b-535d-96f8-d8e0e0f27213","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p2fs7p/eli5_how_do_i_lose_money_by_timing_the_market/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p2fs7p/eli5_how_do_i_lose_money_by_timing_the_market/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"sandpapercrumpet","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/sandpapercrumpet","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"sandpapercrumpet","score":81,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ELI5：市場のタイミングでどのようにお金を失うか","the_new_excerpt":"決まりきった説明書をいくら読んでも無駄なようです（例：Bob\n最悪のマーケットタイマー、投資信託の常識など）をいくら読んでも、私の頭の中では\n戻ろうとします。\n\nほとんどの指標で、市場は過去のどの時期よりも過大評価されています。\nほとんどの尺度で、市場は歴史上のどの時期よりも過大評価されている。過大評価されているものを買うと...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"ELI5：如何通过把握市场时机来输钱","the_new_excerpt":"我读了多少例行的解释，似乎都无济于事（例如，Bob\n最差的市场计时员，甚至是《共同基金常识》），我的大脑都会找到一种方法，让我回到这个问题上。\n办法回到这个问题上。\n\n根据大多数措施，现在的市场比历史上的任何时候都要高估。\n历史上的任何时候。购买高估值的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ELI5：如何通過把握市場時機來輸錢","the_new_excerpt":"我讀了多少例行的解釋，似乎都無濟於事（例如，Bob\n最差的市場計時員，甚至是《共同基金常識》），我的大腦都會找到一種方法，讓我回到這個問題上。\n辦法回到這個問題上。\n\n根據大多數措施，現在的市場比歷史上的任何時候都要高估。\n歷史上的任何時候。購買高估值的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1425548931212222468","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1425548931212222468","title":"S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high for the 46th time this year. $SPX https://t.co/kmZbhY8cDz","date":"August 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"S&S;P 500は、今年46回目の史上最高値で取引を終了しました。$SPX https://t.co/kmZbhY8cDz","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"S&amp;P 500指数今年第46次收于历史新高。$SPX https://t.co/kmZbhY8cDz","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"S&amp;P 500指數今年第46次收於歷史新高。$SPX https://t.co/kmZbhY8cDz","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-9d18aa55-ffd6-5b03-a299-d5e5c4d3f289","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2iab3/14250_in_24_minutes/","title":"$14,250 in 24 minutes","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 11, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"24分で14,250円","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"24分钟内完成14,250美元","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"24分鐘內完成14,250美元","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-66063744-382b-535d-96f8-d8e0e0f27213","previousId":"TweetPost-1425548931212222468","nextId":"RedditPost-9d18aa55-ffd6-5b03-a299-d5e5c4d3f289","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p2fs7p/eli5_how_do_i_lose_money_by_timing_the_market/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
