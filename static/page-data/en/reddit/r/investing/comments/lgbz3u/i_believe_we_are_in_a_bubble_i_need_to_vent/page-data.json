Why are they trading at 100x their top line?! Some companies are burning money like never before, have a smaller revenue than before, and are firing people left and right, but they still grew 700%. wtf. Take SPWR as an example, or LMND. I walk past the LMND offices every day, I met Shai Wininger in person. I&#39;m not going to rant about that specific company, but the market is disconnected from reality. LMND has 80M in revenue, burns money, doesn&#39;t grow, but tripled in value in 6 months. Why??</p>\n\n<p>Half of the stock charts that I&#39;m looking at seem normal and then in 2020 they shoot up like never before. You can let a 5 year old pick any 5 stocks and it would have netted you a 30% return on average, easy!</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s happening? This is unprecedented.</p>\n\n<p>I need someone to prove me wrong, or at least provide me with some rationale as to what is happening.</p>\n\n<p>With all of that said, I&#39;m still investing big on margin, but I&#39;m strongly considering changing my portfolio to things that I believe are more solid, and jump out of the 10x bandwagons. I made insane gains last year, but this party can&#39;t go on forever and it needs to come down to earth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","title":"I believe we are in a bubble [I need to vent...]","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T04:29:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 04:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2a97076c-83c2-5d02-9826-0e4c860c6c49","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lgbz3u/i_believe_we_are_in_a_bubble_i_need_to_vent/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ButtFlapMan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ButtFlapMan","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ButtFlapMan","score":239,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我相信我们是在泡沫中[我需要发泄...]。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我相信我們是在泡沫中[我需要發泄...]。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-44db3d64-7989-5ec0-a8d1-65bba53c6773","excerpt":"Hey guys, this is going to sound like a dumb Q.
