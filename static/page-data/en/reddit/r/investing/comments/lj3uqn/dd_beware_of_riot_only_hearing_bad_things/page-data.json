As such,  with the recent increase in  BTC  /USC RIOT has gained also, but  sometime on Feb  9th   it started diverging from  BTC  /USD and has only  increased the divide since then. Why? There hasn&#39;t  been a single  catalyst coming from inside the company and it doesn&#39;t  hold any  BTC    and is a money losing operation while trading at 1288 times last  quarter&#39;s  earnings . So my guess is that there&#39;s no reason to sustain  this diverges and thus we&#39;ll go down from here.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s going bankrupt, but it should revert back to being tightly correlated with  BTC  /USD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note:  Other comments suggest that the current boom is due to a press release  stating RIOT has begun using a newly acquired haul of bit mining  hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3661232-riot-blockchain-stock-climbs-as-new-miners-to-boost-capacity-to-1-ehs\">https://seekingalpha.com/news/3661232-riot-blockchain-stock-climbs-as-new-miners-to-boost-capacity-to-1-ehs</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>My prediction/guess - it reverts back to $33/share level.I&#39;ve  dug deeper into RIOT since I saw some comments about their  historical  price. The company goes back to the year 2000, which seemed  odd for a  blockchain company. <strong>After  reading their 2016 10-K report I  learned that up to later 2017 it was a  failing biotech company called  Bioptix (also having gone by the names  Venaxis and Aspen Biopharma).  They were going out of business but then  in 2017 the CEO rebranded it to  RIOT and started mining bitcoin.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>There  was even an SEC investigation (dropped in February 2020) into the   company. The investigation was due to possible securities fraud given  how they pumped their stock by adding &quot;blockchain&quot; to their name.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Second page of RIOT&#39;s annual report: <a href=\"https://ir.riotblockchain.com/annual-reports?page=2\">https://ir.riotblockchain.com/annual-reports?page=2</a></p>\n\n<p>Quick search of &quot;RIOT SEC investigation&quot;, bullet point from CNBC:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The SEC charged 20 people and entities in September for what it called “classic pump-and-dump schemes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/former-riot-blockchain-ceo-to-settle-for-alleged-market-manipulation.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/21/former-riot-blockchain-ceo-to-settle-for-alleged-market-manipulation.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lj3uqn/dd_beware_of_riot_only_hearing_bad_things/","title":"DD: Beware of RIOT, only hearing bad things.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T20:51:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 20:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a43391fc-1ab9-5de3-b767-2e14503493e0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj3uqn/dd_beware_of_riot_only_hearing_bad_things/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj3uqn/dd_beware_of_riot_only_hearing_bad_things/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"scarydinosaur","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/scarydinosaur","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"scarydinosaur","score":119,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"DD：小心RIOT，只听过坏话。","the_new_excerpt":"引自morgan9471[https://www.tradingview.com/u/morgan9471/]关于：\nTradingView，所有真正的DD都归他。\n\n\n\n> 这是我第一次在TradingView上发表想法 所以我很想听听你的意见\n> 思想/批评。\n> \n> 前提是先说明RIOT与BTC高度相关... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DD：小心RIOT，只聽過壞話。","the_new_excerpt":"引自morgan9471[https://www.tradingview.com/u/morgan9471/]關於：\nTradingView，所有真正的DD都歸他。\n\n\n\n> 這是我第一次在TradingView上發表想法 所以我很想聽聽你的意見\n> 思想/批評。\n> \n> 前提是先說明RIOT與BTC高度相關... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b2d95b74-138b-51bb-bce8-442748d24dd6","excerpt":"Thesis: GME short interest may stand at minimum 107% since January 27th.
