Overtime if I stay in this fund I will lose much more than I will gain from a the expense ratio.</p>\n\n<p>is there something I dont know about where I could roll over the 401k every year somewhere else with lower expense ratios? If not, I do not understand the argument for saying to contribute up to employer matches with high exp ratio funds. </p>\n\n<p>Even considering the advantages of the tax deferred space, I have not done the calculations, but long term, I am pretty sure investing in a taxable account would be better than the 401k with 1% exp ratios. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any where to leave my company&#39;s 401k every year and still be tax deferred, whether in a different 401k plan or rolling over while still working at the same company.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t plan on working forever at my current job, so it may not matter too much for me.
