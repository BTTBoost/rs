The company’s API software, often referred to as the “plumbing” behind fintech companies, lets start-ups connect to users’ bank accounts. The company says it integrates with more than 11,000 banks.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Plaid CEO Zach Perret said in a statement the company will work with Visa as an investor and partner going forward.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The deal hit a snag late last year after the DOJ pointed out Visa’s acquisition could eliminate a nascent competitive threat. The DOJ cited Visa CEO Al Kelly’s description of the deal as an “insurance policy” to neutralize a “threat to our important US debit business.”</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The department argued at the time there was potential for the deal to extend a Visa “monopoly” on debit transactions, adding that it “must be stopped.”</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The DOJ said in a statement Tuesday that termination of the merger was “a victory for American consumers and small businesses.”  </p>\n\n<p>The lawsuit symbolized a step that many tech critics say should have been taken by the Federal Trade Commission back when it was approving <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB\">Facebook</a>’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.  </p>\n\n<p>Now, those mergers are re-entering public discussion. Late last year, the FTC and several states filed antitrust lawsuits against Facebook, alleging it used its market power to squash competitors before they could become true rivals to Facebook’s empire. The suits suggest remedies that could include requiring Facebook to spin off those two businesses.  </p>\n\n<p><em>-- CNBC’s Kate Rooney and Lauren Feiner contributed to this report.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/visa-abandons-takeover-of-plaid-after-doj-raises-antitrust-concerns.html\">CNBC</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kwae77/visa_abandons_takeover_of_plaid_after_doj_raises/","title":"Visa abandons takeover of Plaid after DOJ raises antitrust concerns","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-13T14:08:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-13 14:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3a59b546-1d71-5e9f-9f74-d08d467687b5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kwae77/visa_abandons_takeover_of_plaid_after_doj_raises/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kwae77/visa_abandons_takeover_of_plaid_after_doj_raises/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":144,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"在司法部提出反垄断问题后，Visa放弃收购Plaid。","the_new_excerpt":">Visa(V)[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE]已经结束了对其的收购。\n> 硅谷创业公司Plaid[https://plaid.com]大约两个月的努力。\n> 在司法部提起反垄断诉讼之后\n> [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-to-block-visas...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在司法部提出反壟斷問題後，Visa放棄收購Plaid。","the_new_excerpt":">Visa(V)[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE]已經結束了對其的收購。\n> 硅谷創業公司Plaid[https://plaid.com]大約兩個月的努力。\n> 在司法部提起反壟斷訴訟之後\n> [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-to-block-visas...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d3ca2e52-8dd1-57fb-9573-7c046648bad1","excerpt":"I agree with her that the genomics, autonomous/robotics, next gen internet,\nfintech and 3D printing have significant growth potential.
