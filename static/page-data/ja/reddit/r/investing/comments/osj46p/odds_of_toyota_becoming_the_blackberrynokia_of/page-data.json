Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency had sought to strip California of its power to set its own emissions standards. But under Biden, that rule was reversed, allowing California and other states to impose tougher standards.</p>\n\n<p>Toyota, which sided with the Trump administration in its battle with California, was not part of the original compromise. And the company has argued against EV-friendly policies in India and in its native country, Japan, as well.</p>\n\n<p>Toyota’s behind-the-scene efforts to slow the momentum behind EV-friendly policies is surprising, given its status as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. </p>\n\n<p>With the release of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the company helped pave the way for Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. And more recently, the automaker has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru\">revealed plans to release 70 new models by 2025</a>, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids.</p>\n\n<p>But that doesn’t hide the fact that Toyota has fallen far behind its competitors, appearing content to rest on its laurels while the rest of the industry has lapped it several times. Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years, while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. And Toyota’s failure to embrace EVs is not a new concept; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/energy-environment/20electric.html\"><em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> noted as much in this article from 2009</a>.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/osj46p/odds_of_toyota_becoming_the_blackberrynokia_of/","title":"Odds of Toyota becoming the Blackberry/Nokia of automotives?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-27T23:26:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-27 23:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3ef081ff-17ec-5b0e-adb1-81e6ca818734","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/osj46p/odds_of_toyota_becoming_the_blackberrynokia_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/osj46p/odds_of_toyota_becoming_the_blackberrynokia_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"yes_i_abide","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/yes_i_abide","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"yes_i_abide","score":62,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"トヨタが自動車のブラックベリー／ノキアになる確率は？","the_new_excerpt":"億万長者の豊田章男CEOをはじめとするトヨタのトップたちが\n[https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/],\nトヨタは、電気自動車のトレンドを「過大評価」していると公言しています。\nその理由のひとつは、電力供給に伴う排出ガスの問題です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"丰田成为汽车界黑莓/诺基亚的几率？","the_new_excerpt":"丰田公司的高层管理人员，包括亿万富翁CEO丰田章男\n[https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/]。\n已经公开表示，电动汽车的趋势是 \"被夸大了\"\n部分原因是与电力相关的排放...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"豐田成爲汽車界黑莓/諾基亞的機率？","the_new_excerpt":"豐田公司的高層管理人員，包括億萬富翁CEO豐田章男\n[https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/]。\n已經公開表示，電動汽車的趨勢是 \"被誇大了\"\n部分原因是與電力相關的排放...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9f0bc420-e768-57e1-9459-0fb2998639d8","excerpt":"Microsoft shares fell as much as 3% in extended trading on Tuesday after the\nsoftware and hardware company issued fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and reported\na revenue decline for sales of Windows licenses to device makers.\n\nRaw results:\n\n * Earnings: $2.17 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.92 per share…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/osvt2f/microsoft_posts_big_earnings_beat_but_windows/","title":"Microsoft posts big earnings beat, but Windows revenue from device makers falls 3%","date":"July 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"マイクロソフト、大幅な増益を達成するも、デバイスメーカーからのWindows収益は3％減","the_new_excerpt":"マイクロソフトの株価は、第4四半期に発表されたソフトウェアとハードウェアの決算発表を受けて、火曜日の取引時間中に3％も下落しました。\nソフトウェアおよびハードウェア企業であるマイクロソフト社は、第4四半期の業績を発表しました。\nこれは、ソフトウェアおよびハードウェア企業である同社が、第4四半期の業績を発表し、デバイスメーカーへのWindowsライセンスの販売が減収となったことによるものです。\n\n結果は以下の通りです。\n\n * 収益：調整後1株当たり2.17ドル（前年同期は1.92ドル）。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"微软公布盈利大增，但来自设备制造商的Windows收入下降了3%。","the_new_excerpt":"微软股价在周二的延长交易中跌幅高达3%，此前该公司发布了第四财季财报。\n软件和硬件公司发布第四财季财报，并报告了向设备制造商销售Windows许可的收入下降。\n向设备制造商销售Windows许可证的收入下降。\n\n原始结果。\n\n * 收益：调整后每股2.17美元，与每股1.92美元相比...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"微軟公佈盈利大增，但來自設備製造商的Windows收入下降了3%。","the_new_excerpt":"微軟股價在週二的延長交易中跌幅高達3%，此前該公司發佈了第四財季財報。\n軟件和硬件公司發佈第四財季財報，並報告了向設備製造商銷售Windows許可的收入下降。\n向設備製造商銷售Windows許可證的收入下降。\n\n原始結果。\n\n * 收益：調整後每股2.17美元，與每股1.92美元相比...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ff928487-ce33-5b3a-a007-1a948dc34788","excerpt":"This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme\nfor today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just\nignore the theme and/or post your arguments against TA…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/osjjkl/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_jul/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday -
