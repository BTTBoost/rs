It is not quite accurate to say — as the New York Post’s headline does — that shareholders fired Morina. It’s more that they demoted him. He lost a lot of titles:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On May 13, 2021, the Board removed Mr. Morina from all officer positions he held with the Company, including President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer of the Corporation, effective immediately as of such date. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But he still runs the deli:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Morina and Ms. Lindenmuth remain principals of the Company’s operating subsidiary, Your Hometown Deli, LLC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See, Your Hometown Deli is a deli in Paulsboro, New Jersey, that occasionally sells sandwiches, mainly to curious financial journalists. Hometown International Inc. is a U.S. public company, with a basic market capitalization of about $100 million and a fully diluted market cap of about $2 billion, that is some sort of mechanism for taking a foreign company public in U.S. markets and that also happens to own the deli. The $2 billion public company is now run by Peter Coker Jr., a Hong Kong-based financier who was already the chairman of the board and a major investor in Hometown International, and who “intends to devote his full time to seeking a business combination for the Company,” as the company said back in March. It makes sense that the mergers guy in Hong Kong would run the $2 billion company that’s in the business of merging with an Asian company, and the wrestling coach in New Jersey would run the local deli in New Jersey. Sensible division of labor! It was always weird to have the New Jersey wrestling guy in charge of the Asian merger company! Also it’s weird that they’re the same company.</p>\n\n<p>The deli has had some other good filings recently. Yesterday it disclosed that its quarterly report will be late, “because the Registrant needs additional time to complete certain disclosures and analyses to be included in the Report.” The relevant quarter ended on March 31, before Hometown became famous, so the problem is not that they sold so many sandwiches to so many financial journalists that their accounting systems couldn’t keep up. I assume that, given their recent scrutiny, everything just needs to be lawyered a bit more carefully than it has been in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Also here is an April 30 filing in which Hometown “disavows the price of its publicly quoted stock on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol ‘HWIN.’ Management is aware of no basis to support the Company’s stock price, based upon its revenue or assets.” I am not sure I have ever seen a company “disavow” its stock price before, but I suppose it makes sense. The filing accurately notes that “there has not been, nor is there, significant trading volume in the Company’s stock,” so it’s not like anyone is particularly getting ripped off by the deli’s weird stock price. It’s just a weird artifact. Still, probably best to disavow it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This whole story is just top tier entertainment, also if you&#39;ve missed some of the context see the separate comment with backstory.  And I&#39;ve said this a thousand times, if you&#39;re not getting Matt&#39;s daily newsletter than you&#39;re really missing out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/nfgipo/update_on_your_hometown_deli_in_new_jersey/","title":"Update on Your Hometown Deli in New Jersey","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-18T20:18:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-18 20:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ed09b979-3020-562d-9ea0-2faf62594c83","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nfgipo/update_on_your_hometown_deli_in_new_jersey/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nfgipo/update_on_your_hometown_deli_in_new_jersey/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"MasterCookSwag","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MasterCookSwag","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MasterCookSwag","score":163,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ニュージャージーのホームタウン・デリの最新情報","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-18/s-p-firm-forgot-to-update-the-xiv-index\n\n関連するテキスト\n\n> 20億円のデリの状況はどうですか？\n> \n> ホームタウン・インターナショナルは、ニュージャージー州の不思議なデリカテッセン会社です。\n> 株式市場では1億ドル近い評価を受けていますが、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"新泽西州的家乡熟食店的最新情况","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-18/s-p-firm-forgot-to-update-the-xiv-index\n\n相关文字。\n\n> 20亿美元的熟食店的情况如何？\n> \n> > 家乡国际，这家神秘的新泽西熟食公司，其\n> > 股票市场上的估值接近1亿美元--尽管...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新澤西州的家鄉熟食店的最新情況","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-18/s-p-firm-forgot-to-update-the-xiv-index\n\n相關文字。\n\n> 20億美元的熟食店的情況如何？\n> \n> > 家鄉國際，這家神祕的新澤西熟食公司，其\n> > 股票市場上的估值接近1億美元--儘管...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1394717327644581891","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1394717327644581891","title":"Why is crypto SafeMoon trending, and why is Dave Portnoy using it to diversify his bitcoin exposure? https://t.co/nAQKDPIy7y","date":"May 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"なぜ暗号化されたSafeMoonがトレンドになっているのか、なぜDave Portnoyはビットコインのエクスポージャーを分散するためにSafeMoonを使っているのか？https://t.co/nAQKDPIy7y","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"为什么加密货币SafeMoon成为趋势，以及为什么Dave Portnoy用它来分散他的比特币风险？https://t.co/nAQKDPIy7y","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"爲什麼加密貨幣SafeMoon成爲趨勢，以及爲什麼Dave Portnoy用它來分散他的比特幣風險？https://t.co/nAQKDPIy7y","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e5964f96-82ac-5739-aede-ffcb1b75099e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nevg8w/sold_my_poor_person_house_for_80k_need_300k_to/","title":"Sold my poor person house for $80k.
