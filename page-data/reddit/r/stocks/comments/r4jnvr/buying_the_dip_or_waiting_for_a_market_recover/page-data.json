Is the market going to recover fully and bounce back from Black Friday’s covid variant scare, or will people start to realize that the vaccine and up to date boosters are still effective in containing the virus.</p>\n\n<p>What are your moved for tomorrow?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Not to be biased whatsoever, but I personally believe that after delta’s variant scare, I believe that pharmaceuticals and government officials are better prepared to research the virus and assign its concern accordingly; whether it be creating a whole new vaccine (very, very unlikely) or safety measures (vaccine/booster mandates, social distancing, hospital beds, etc). In addition, I believe that it has been proven that the tech sector in particular has shown great resistance to virus. From learning from past events, investors, like myself, are going to be less weary of the dips and expand holdings into strong companies like AMD, Microsoft, Apple, etc. Idk how reliable futures are but they’ve shown to be very bullish for tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r4jnvr/buying_the_dip_or_waiting_for_a_market_recover/","title":"Buying the dip or waiting for a market recover","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-29T05:40:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-29 05:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r4jnvr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r4jnvr/buying_the_dip_or_waiting_for_a_market_recover/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r4jnvr/buying_the_dip_or_waiting_for_a_market_recover/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"HopefulIvyAdmit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/HopefulIvyAdmit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"HopefulIvyAdmit","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r4mdnd","excerpt":"I’m a fairly new investor (post Covid crash—started investing around late June)\nand I was wondering where I could find some reading material on the psychology\nof traders/investors before the crashes in 2000 and 2008.
