That&#39;s what realtors want in this market.  3% for the buyer&#39;s agent, 3% for the seller&#39;s agent, and all they have to do is take some pictures and put that shit up on the internet.  It&#39;s galling.  You have a $500k house and want to sell it?  Well, not without paying $30k to some shithead with an MLS account!  And it only gets more galling the richer you get.  The transaction cost on buying and selling homes is just really, really fucking high when you use an agent.</p>\n\n<p>And Zillow knows this, and they know people are sick of paying realtors $3,000-$10,000 per hour to sell their homes.  </p>\n\n<p>Today, I just sold an investment property to Zillow.  They offered me the Zestimate (their own pricing model which is publicly available on their website), which is great because it&#39;s how I valued my house anyway.  People are always on Zillow looking to see what shit costs, and they just offered me what they said the house was worth. </p>\n\n<p>They charged me about $10k in seller concessions to for repairs and shit, which is higher than you might pay normally, but this is directly in line with my own estimations for what I would have needed to do to sell the house.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, they charges .1%.  POINT ONE PERCENT as a transaction cost.  So at the end of the day, I got exactly the price I expected, I didn&#39;t have to deal with anybody&#39;s bullshit (buyers, agents, showings, cleanings, contractors, staging, pictures) and I basically did the whole thing online.</p>\n\n<p>Their tech is also very good.  Smooth docusigning, good customer service, even remote/Zoom notary services.  </p>\n\n<p>They are going to spruce this house up and then they are going to sell it on their own platform to another buyer.  Even if they don&#39;t make a profit, what they just did is FUCK TWO TO FOUR REALTORS out of their commissions.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like Sony taking a loss on their hardware to get market share.  This is how Zillow is going to win.  It was easier and cheaper and I dont&#39; feel slightly fucked.  But realtors are fucked.  I think Z has earnings on 8/5.  I&#39;m thinking about an option play but I don&#39;t know.  My wife bought like 15k of their stock for a long term hold in her roth, so that&#39;s all we&#39;ve got for now.  What do you think?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/","title":"Zillow is aiming to kill real estate agents","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-17T01:10:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-17 01:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"15805d24-eb84-5578-90ff-47502f68372e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"zer0sumgames","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/zer0sumgames","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"zer0sumgames","score":24665,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Zillowは不動産業者を殺すことを目指している","the_new_excerpt":"1週間の仕事で6％のマイナス それは不動産業者がこの市場で望んでいることです\nこの市場では 買い手のエージェントに3％売り手のエージェントに3％そして彼らがしなければならないのは\n写真を撮ってネットにアップするだけだ 憤りを感じます。\n50万ドルの家を持っていて、それを売りたいですか？それには...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Zillow的目标是杀死房地产经纪人","the_new_excerpt":"一个星期的工作就有他妈的6％。这就是房地产商在这个市场上想要的东西\n市场。买方代理的3%，卖方代理的3%，而他们所要做的就是拍些照片，然后把这些东西放到网上。\n他们要做的就是拍一些照片，然后把这些东西放到网上。这是令人震惊的。\n你有一个50万美元的房子，想卖掉它？那么，没有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Zillow的目標是殺死房地產經紀人","the_new_excerpt":"一個星期的工作就有他媽的6％。這就是房地產商在這個市場上想要的東西\n市場。買方代理的3%，賣方代理的3%，而他們所要做的就是拍些照片，然後把這些東西放到網上。\n他們要做的就是拍一些照片，然後把這些東西放到網上。這是令人震驚的。\n你有一個50萬美元的房子，想賣掉它？那麼，沒有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1416148105020514310","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1416148105020514310","title":"Diabetics make up 40% of COVID deaths in US","date":"July 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国におけるCOVIDによる死亡者の40％が糖尿病患者であることが判明","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"在美国，糖尿病患者占COVID死亡人数的40%。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"在美國，糖尿病患者佔COVID死亡人數的40%。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2c9048e8-eb78-5ec3-be4a-414b00f3aca8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olq2zu/100000_loss_on_gme_options/","title":"-$100,000 Loss on GME Options","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 17, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"-$100,000 GMEオプションの損失","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"-100,000美元的GME期权损失","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"-100,000美元的GME期權損失","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-15805d24-eb84-5578-90ff-47502f68372e","previousId":"TweetPost-1416148105020514310","nextId":"RedditPost-2c9048e8-eb78-5ec3-be4a-414b00f3aca8","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
