Basically, coca cola (I&#39;ll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn&#39;t going anywhere any time soon, and even though it&#39;s a gigantic thing, it&#39;s only at around 54 dollars per share. I&#39;m thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. Plus they pay out dividends very soon about next month, and quarterly at that. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and if something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I&#39;ve mostly been investing in ETF&#39;s, with only Visa being my one blue chip company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue chip company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff like the rip-toe currency stuff (can&#39;t say it because word filters are stupid), and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think</p>\n\n<p>My comparison, my portfolio right now is:<br/>\n2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF)<br/>\n3.02 shares of V (Visa)<br/>\n1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF)<br/>\n2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF)<br/>\n(I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here&#39;s where I come to ask if it&#39;s worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the help and if you read this far, thanks for reading this far too. I&#39;ve also noticed IRM for similar reasons, but I don&#39;t know much about IRM compared to Coca Cola.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/nhpkn0/is_it_worth_it_to_invest_in_multiple_shares_of/","title":"Is it worth it to invest in multiple shares of Coca Cola for Dividends?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-21T16:10:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-21 16:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"eea9bb98-6009-5757-90ae-23218e88ddd1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nhpkn0/is_it_worth_it_to_invest_in_multiple_shares_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nhpkn0/is_it_worth_it_to_invest_in_multiple_shares_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"FlamingOrange","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/FlamingOrange","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"FlamingOrange","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"配当金目当てでコカ・コーラを複数株投資する価値はありますか？","the_new_excerpt":"私は新しい投資家ですが、日々勉強し、いろいろなことを調べています。\nその中で、コカ・コーラに注目しました。基本的に、コカ・コーラ（以下、KOとします。\n基本的には、コカ・コーラ（以下、KOとします）は、約3のdiv/yieldを持っていることが示されました。それに加えて\nその上、KOはすぐにどこかに行ってしまうわけではないし、たとえそれが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为了分红而投资多股可口可乐公司的股票是否值得？","the_new_excerpt":"我是一个新的投资者，虽然我每天都在学习更多的东西，并且越来越多地研究这些东西。\n越来越多的东西，可口可乐公司引起了我的注意。基本上，可口可乐（我将\n可口可乐（我现在只说KO）被证明有3左右的股息/收益率。除此之外\n而且，KO很快就不会消失，尽管它是一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲了分紅而投資多股可口可樂公司的股票是否值得？","the_new_excerpt":"我是一個新的投資者，雖然我每天都在學習更多的東西，並且越來越多地研究這些東西。\n越來越多的東西，可口可樂公司引起了我的注意。基本上，可口可樂（我將\n可口可樂（我現在只說KO）被證明有3左右的股息/收益率。除此之外\n而且，KO很快就不會消失，儘管它是一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-52cada63-6ff4-54c7-8486-1a591897f3f8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhszhj/we_see_you_gme_amc/","title":"“We See You” - GME AMC","date":"May 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"We See You\" - GME AMC","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"我们看到你\" - GME AMC","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"我們看到你\" - GME AMC","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7a332003-12e6-5288-bea3-c350664cc182","excerpt":"In the recent wall street riot, DKNG has pulled by 40% from the high of March.\nOn closely looking at financial report and stock analysis\n[https://www.myfinreads.com/draftkings-strong-buy-the-dip-opportunity/] :\n\n>  1.
