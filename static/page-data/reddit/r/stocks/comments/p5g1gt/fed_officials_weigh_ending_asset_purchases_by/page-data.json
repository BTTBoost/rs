Officials at their July 27-28 meeting deliberated on two important questions: when to start paring their monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities, and how quickly to reduce, or taper, them. The Fed is set to release on Wednesday minutes of the meeting that could provide further clues about those discussions.</p>\n\n<p>The answers are important to financial markets because Fed officials have said they would prefer to conclude the bond-buying program before considering when to raise interest rates from near-zero. At their June 15-16 policy meeting, 13 of 18 Fed officials projected they would raise rates by the end of 2023; seven expected to do so by the end of 2022. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a July 28 news conference that the Fed was still “a ways away from considering raising interest rates. It’s not something that is on our radar screen right now.” A recent run of strong hiring reports have strengthened the case for the Fed to announce at its next meeting, Sept. 21-22, its intentions to start tapering, potentially as soon as its following meeting in November.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-weigh-ending-asset-purchases-by-mid-2022-11629106200?mod=hp_lead_pos2\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-weigh-ending-asset-purchases-by-mid-2022-11629106200?mod=hp_lead_pos2</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p5g1gt/fed_officials_weigh_ending_asset_purchases_by/","title":"Fed Officials Weigh Ending Asset Purchases by Mid-2022","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-16T15:27:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-16 15:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1fa9d0e2-6618-52a0-a33b-f94c760cd385","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p5g1gt/fed_officials_weigh_ending_asset_purchases_by/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p5g1gt/fed_officials_weigh_ending_asset_purchases_by/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"jmmy1232","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jmmy1232","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jmmy1232","score":480,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FRB高官、2022年半ばまでの資産購入終了を検討","the_new_excerpt":"米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は、景気回復が困難な場合、約3ヵ月後に金融緩和政策の縮小を開始することで合意に近づいている。\n米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は、景気回復が続けば、約3カ月後に金融緩和政策の縮小を開始することで合意に近づいています。\n来年半ばまでに資産買入プログラムを終了することを推し進めているところもあります。\n\n最近のインタビューや公の場での発言で、何人かは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美联储官员权衡到2022年中期结束资产购买活动","the_new_excerpt":"美联储官员正在接近达成协议，如果经济持续复苏，他们将在大约三个月内开始缩减其宽松的货币政策。\n如果经济持续复苏，将在大约三个月内开始缩减其宽松的货币政策。\n一些人推动在明年年中之前结束其资产购买计划。\n\n在最近的采访和公开声明中，一些人已经...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美聯儲官員權衡到2022年中期結束資產購買活動","the_new_excerpt":"美聯儲官員正在接近達成協議，如果經濟持續復甦，他們將在大約三個月內開始縮減其寬鬆的貨幣政策。\n如果經濟持續復甦，將在大約三個月內開始縮減其寬鬆的貨幣政策。\n一些人推動在明年年中之前結束其資產購買計劃。\n\n在最近的採訪和公開聲明中，一些人已經...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0c40dfcc-17c9-52ac-b67a-d12879300d41","excerpt":"Per title, this is my current allocation strategy.
