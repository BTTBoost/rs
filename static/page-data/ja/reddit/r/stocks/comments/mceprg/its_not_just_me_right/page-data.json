I feel like I have a pretty well diversified portfolio.  I&#39;m not really heavy on any one particular stock out of the ones below, so I&#39;m not even sure where the majority of the losses are coming from.  I&#39;m still green on most everything but I&#39;ve given back a lot of gains, these definitely aren&#39;t all my investments but a majority of the bigger positions.<br/>\nTech/Growth:  AAPL, GOOG, PLTR, TSLA, AMZN, AMD, UBER, BABA, JD etc. ~35%<br/>\nTravel/Rebound (cyclical):  UAL, AAL, OXY, MGM, MAR, NCLH, TRIP, ABNB ~30%<br/>\nFinancials: WFC, BCS, JPM, BAC~10%<br/>\nRetail stocks for stimulus check play:  UAA, NKE, M, LULU, etc.  ~10%<br/>\nOther positions making up less than 15%   </p>\n\n<p>Somehow I&#39;ve lost about 20% of my portfolio with these names in the last month, it doesn&#39;t feel like it but every day it goes down 1 or 2% and that starts to add up.  I know I know, in 5 years who cares but I just wanted to know if other people seem to be in the same boat.  I haven&#39;t seen the main indexes see that kind of loss so I&#39;m not getting where it seems to be coming from.  Even today when all looked great in the morning now somehow I&#39;m deep red again (another 2%) despite indexes being mostly stable.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mceprg/its_not_just_me_right/","title":"It's not just me right?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-24T23:32:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-24 23:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"487c4d21-1ead-55ba-9154-ac6b733af023","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mceprg/its_not_just_me_right/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mceprg/its_not_just_me_right/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"calipfarris01","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/calipfarris01","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"calipfarris01","score":6873,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不只是我吧？","the_new_excerpt":"在过去的一个月里，我一直在被绝对粉碎一点一点的每个\n天，似乎在每个行业。我觉得我有一个很好的多元化的。\n投资组合。我不是真的重在任何一个特定的股票的那些。\n下面，所以我都不知道大部分的损失在哪里... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不只是我吧？","the_new_excerpt":"在過去的一個月裏，我一直在被絕對粉碎一點一點的每個\n天，似乎在每個行業。我覺得我有一個很好的多元化的。\n投資組合。我不是真的重在任何一個特定的股票的那些。\n下面，所以我都不知道大部分的損失在哪裏... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2a7f7f35-75b8-5f7b-89f9-732d558ba3b5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc6wt6/im_not_selling_im_still_buying_i_put_the_rest_of/","title":"I’m not selling.
