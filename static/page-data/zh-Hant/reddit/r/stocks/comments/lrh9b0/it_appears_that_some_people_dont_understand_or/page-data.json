In the extreme case you lose your shirt. There is a formula for it: Expected return over a long period of time is mu minus sigma squared divided by 2, where mu is mean and sigma is standard deviation. </p>\n\n<p>The reason I am writing this - someone asked a question: “Why not invest in triple-leveraged Nasdaq ETF?  Yes it will go up and down a lot but it’s long term average return will be triple the regular Nasdaq.”  Well, yes, it will, but volatility drag will be huge as well and will drag down your expected return over time.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lrh9b0/it_appears_that_some_people_dont_understand_or/","title":"It appears that some people don’t understand (or never heard of) “Volatility Drag”...
