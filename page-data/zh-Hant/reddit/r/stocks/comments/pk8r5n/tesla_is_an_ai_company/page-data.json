And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.</p>\n\n<p>My thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few</li>\n<li>Carmakers who can&#39;t create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/\">40+ other companies.</a></li>\n<li>If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn&#39;t any moat in self-driving capabilities.</li>\n<li>There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can&#39;t take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn&#39;t a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That&#39;s moat. Self-driving doesn&#39;t seem to have moat or network effect. It feels like self-driving is a must-have feature that eventually all car makers will add.</li>\n<li>I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It&#39;s very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.</li>\n<li>Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn&#39;t like a beta app. It&#39;s life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.</li>\n<li>If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it&#39;s actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pk8r5n/tesla_is_an_ai_company/","title":"Tesla is an \"AI\" company","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-08T14:33:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-08 14:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pk8r5n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pk8r5n/tesla_is_an_ai_company/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pk8r5n/tesla_is_an_ai_company/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"senttoschool","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/senttoschool","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"senttoschool","score":196,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テスラは「AI」の会社","the_new_excerpt":"から、テスラは電気自動車の会社ではなく「AI」の会社だと言っている人が多かった。\nこのスレッドをご覧ください。\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney_is_to_netflix_as_x_is_to_tesla/\n\nテスラの自動運転機能は、他の自動車メーカーよりもはるかに進んでいるというテーゼです。\n他の自動車メーカーは追いつけないというものです。そして...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"特斯拉是一家 \"人工智能 \"公司","the_new_excerpt":"很多人说特斯拉是一家 \"人工智能 \"公司，而不是一家电动汽车公司。\n这个主题。\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney_is_to_netflix_as_x_is_to_tesla/\n\n其论点是，特斯拉在其自动驾驶能力方面遥遥领先，其他汽车制造商无法赶上。\n其他汽车制造商无法追赶。而且...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉是一家 \"人工智能 \"公司","the_new_excerpt":"很多人說特斯拉是一家 \"人工智能 \"公司，而不是一家電動汽車公司。\n這個主題。\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pjlah0/disney_is_to_netflix_as_x_is_to_tesla/\n\n其論點是，特斯拉在其自動駕駛能力方面遙遙領先，其他汽車製造商無法趕上。\n其他汽車製造商無法追趕。而且...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pk25mu","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pk25mu/every_dip/","title":"Every dip","date":"September 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"すべてのディップ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"每一次浸泡","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"每一次浸泡","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pkayti","excerpt":"Morgan Stanley’s optimistic view of the economy isn’t keeping it from warning\nabout a looming correction in the U.S. stock market. “The issue is that the\nmarkets are priced for perfection and vulnerable, especially since there hasn’t\nbeen a correction greater than 10% since the March 2020 low,” said…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pkayti/stocks_may_fall_15_by_yearend_warns_morgan_stanley/","title":"Stocks may fall 15% by year-end, warns Morgan Stanley","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 08, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"株式は年末までに15％下落する可能性があるとモルガン・スタンレー社が警告","the_new_excerpt":"モルガン・スタンレーは、経済に対する楽観的な見方をしていますが、それだけではなく、米国の景気回復が近づいていることを警告しています。\nモルガン・スタンレーは、経済に対する楽観的な見方をしていますが、それだけではなく、米国の株式市場に迫る調整を警告しています。「問題は\n特に、2020年3月の安値以降、10％以上の調整が行われていないため、市場は完璧で脆弱な価格設定になっています。\n特に、2020年3月の安値以降、10％以上の調整が行われていないため、市場は完璧に値付けされており、脆弱であるということだ」と述べています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"摩根士丹利警告说，年底前股票可能下跌15%。","the_new_excerpt":"摩根士丹利对经济的乐观看法并没有使其不警告\n对美国股市即将出现的调整发出警告。\"问题是\n问题是，市场的价格是完美的，也是脆弱的，尤其是自2020年3月的低点以来，还没有出现过超过10%的修正。\n自2020年3月的低点以来，没有出现过超过10%的修正，\"他说。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"摩根士丹利警告說，年底前股票可能下跌15%。","the_new_excerpt":"摩根士丹利對經濟的樂觀看法並沒有使其不警告\n對美國股市即將出現的調整發出警告。\"問題是\n問題是，市場的價格是完美的，也是脆弱的，尤其是自2020年3月的低點以來，還沒有出現過超過10%的修正。\n自2020年3月的低點以來，沒有出現過超過10%的修正，\"他說。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pk8r5n","previousId":"RedditPost-pk25mu","nextId":"RedditPost-pkayti","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pk8r5n/tesla_is_an_ai_company/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
