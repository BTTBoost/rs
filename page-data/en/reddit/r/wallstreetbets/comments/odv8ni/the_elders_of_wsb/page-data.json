It&#39;s not like Volmageddon ever happened). He was confident that he set up a play that would net him a guaranteed total of $38k of riskless profit in 2 years. With the right amount of leverage he could scale this up nicely</li>\n<li>Sold hundreds of Box Spreads on Robinhood using margin and got paid a credit for each box spread. His account went <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/\">from $5k of his own money to about $200k worth of risk</a></li>\n<li>Proceeded to withdraw $10k in cash, because who woudn&#39;t?</li>\n<li>If a Box Spread gets held till expiry it&#39;s risk free, but that&#39;s not how option selling works because there is always assignment risk...and 1r0nyman completely forgot about that</li>\n<li>To make it worse, Robinhood didn’t pick up on the risk level of his box spread trade and actually echoed back to him that there wasn’t a big amount of risk on the trade. Much like other elders here, 1R0NYMAN found a glitch/cheatcode in Robinhood which ultimately added even more fuel to the fire</li>\n<li>Got assigned short shares, -$58k loss, account closed out. Robinhood banned box spreads after the fiasco and emailed its entire client base about its policy change as a direct result of what happened with 1R0NYMAN</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/analfarmer2\">u/analfarmer2</a>, <strong>the paragon of FDs</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>analfarmer2, a 19-year-old became the true paragon of how OGs traded FDs back in the elder days. He somehow got access to about $100k in his trading account (described as ‘online biz and margin’)</li>\n<li>His first FD was a $110k bet on $ALGN with 2DTE calls. The company announced a share buyback, and shares rocketed the next day gaining him $180k. His account went to $343k</li>\n<li>A couple of days later our guy dropped $170k on1DTE  SPY puts, and again got insanely lucky as the market tanked after a Trump tweet about the Chinese trade embargo. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksrsf/spy_puts_277k_profit_in_1_minute/\"><strong>His trading account was up another $277k up to $646k</strong></a></li>\n<li>He took another massive bet the following day, buying $600k worth of SPY calls 1DTE. analfarmer2 sold out of his position at a $500k loss. He made a few more unknown trades and found himself down to $41k</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co31pq/my_final_yolo_40k_into_cgc_calls_expiring_next/\"><strong>3 days later</strong></a> he bought $40k worth of $CGC calls in anticipation of earnings the following week. This was a more responsible trade -- he had an entire week until expiration, just imagine the possibilities. Earnings were shit, the stock tanked and his FDs were now worthless</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/ControlTheNarrative\">u/ControlTheNarrative</a>, <strong>the wizard of GUH!</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ControlTheNarrative was so wise that he managed to discover the &#39;infinite money cheat code&#39; deeply embedeed into Robinhood&#39;s matrix and as a result redefined what some consider to be beyond their Personal Risk Tolerance</li>\n<li>He was so genius and so retarded at the same time that through his Robinhood Gold account he took his leverage level to 25x, well beyond the 2x allowed by RH</li>\n<li>From an inital deposit of $2k (minimum balance to access RH Gold) he bought 100 shares of AMD for $4k or so, with margin. He then sold an AMD Call Contracts with a $2 strike to get almost all his money back. He then used that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles the buying power, then he sold 2 Call Contracts witht he same $2 strike price to get almost all his money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood&#39;s Margin</li>\n<li>Robinhood let him buy AMD stock on margin that is collateralized by AMD stock he&#39;s already sold. The AMD loop he went through made his buying power go up only because RH was absolutely retardedly (even more so than he was) still counting the AMD stock for his covered calls as part of his margin collateral to buy the options. He rinsed and repeated this process until sufficiently leveraged to his Personal Risk Tolerance (25x leverage)</li>\n<li>Finally, he used his increased buying power to &#39;maximize&#39; gains by loading up on $AAPL put FDs to bet against Tim Apple on an earnings play. Unfortunately, $AAPL destroyed earnings and blew his account</li>\n<li>To make matters worse, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/\">he recorded the market-open and the instant nuking of his account</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/MoonYachts\">u/MoonYachts</a>, <strong>the leverageborn</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Credit. Debt. Equity. Leverage. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when <a href=\"/u/MoonYachts\">u/MoonYachts</a> attacked. MoonYachts was a disciple of <a href=\"/u/ControlTheNarrative\">u/ControlTheNarrative</a>. Through his master&#39;s teachings, MoonYachts also understood that when selling covered calls on Robinhood and if he bought the shares, the stock wasn&#39;t subtracted from the buying power. The cash balance from the covered call got added to his cash balance – increasing the buying power by the premium he took in.</li>\n<li>Only the Fed Chair, master of all four elements, could beat him, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. And although his QE skills were great at the time, he had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone.</li>\n<li>So it happened, that MoonYachts&#39; Personal Risk Tolerance was from the netherrealm and not even the Fed Chair could match him at the time.
