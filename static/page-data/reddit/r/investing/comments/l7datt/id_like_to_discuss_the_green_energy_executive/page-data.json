Durable equipment plays for things like transformers?)</p></li>\n<li><p>Double offshore wind energy production by 2030 (wind energy play)</p></li>\n<li><p>A new civilian climate corps to help with cleaning forests, waterways (potentially good for fishery and forestry plays)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just curious who else had seen this, and what your thoughts are.
