Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.</p>\n\n<p>The Labor Department’s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a “string” of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, “What I see here is somewhat of a ‘goldilocks’ overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it&#39;s because it&#39;s telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it&#39;s actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that&#39;s important.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Recent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. </p>\n\n<p>Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was &quot;still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we’re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Marqeta Inc.
