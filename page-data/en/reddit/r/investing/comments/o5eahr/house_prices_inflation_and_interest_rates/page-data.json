But is it really, or are we actually in the early innings of the start of a massive appreciation of home prices much more than we&#39;ve already seen? </p>\n\n<p>First, housing pretty much only goes up looking at <a href=\"https://dqydj.com/historical-home-prices/\">20+ year time spans</a>.  I don&#39;t own a home (or any REITs), but housing is increasingly looking to me like the safest possible bet over the next decade.  I was going to wait out the storm to buy, but now I&#39;m questioning that logic. It&#39;s also (IMO) by far the safest way to be leveraged, especially for a first time homebuyer.</p>\n\n<p>People bring up &#39;08, but I think it actually strengthens the case if anything. If you bought &quot;the average&quot; home at the absolute worst time at the very peak... you&#39;d be up around 50% today. And  besides the appreciation in value you received the added benefit of living in the home, or collecting rental income if it&#39;s an investment property.</p>\n\n<p>Then we have inflation. Whether transient or not, inflation is an absolute boon for debtholders. If you think the fed is wrong and inflation is going to be terrible, then buying the most expensive home you can reasonably afford seems like the best choice as inflation will eat away at the interest and maybe even some of the principal if it stays high enough long enough. Also the link above shows that over any 20+ year period, house prices have risen in actual value, adjusted for inflation.</p>\n\n<p>The interest rates are still incredibly low and the Fed is going to slowly raise them, and a small amount. The current mortgage rates are basically unheard of in US history.  This is like a once in a generation opportunity with rates this low. </p>\n\n<p>Finally this seems like a straightforward supply and demand problem. The supply of desirable homes grows slowly, because (for example) in desirable locations like London/NYC/SF development is extremely slow or nonexistent due to housing and zoning laws. And the demand grows constantly, because the population size is increasing.</p>\n\n<p>Am I looking at any of this wrong? How are home prices not going to spike even more hugely than before in the current environment? </p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> low interest rates are good for housing, high inflation is good for people with debt, buying even at the peak of the housing bubble in 08 means you are up hugely today, and the population grows faster, than houses in desirable locations can be built. All seem to point to an increase in home prices</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o5eahr/house_prices_inflation_and_interest_rates/","title":"House prices, inflation, and interest rates","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-22T22:37:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-22 22:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9d49b401-7bf3-5bfb-9123-d47cc5270a1c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o5eahr/house_prices_inflation_and_interest_rates/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o5eahr/house_prices_inflation_and_interest_rates/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"oarabbus","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/oarabbus","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"oarabbus","score":39,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"住宅価格、インフレ率、金利","the_new_excerpt":"誰もが知っているように、住宅市場は非常に過熱しており、多くの人がこれをバブルと呼んでいます。\nバブルと呼ばれています。しかし、本当にそうなのか、それとも、今まで以上に住宅価格の大幅な上昇が始まった初期段階なのか？\nしかし、本当にそうなのか、それとも、今まで以上に住宅価格が大幅に上昇する初期段階なのか？\n\n第一に、住宅は20年以上の期間を見ても、かなりの確率で上昇しています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"房价、通货膨胀和利率","the_new_excerpt":"每个人都知道住房市场一直非常热，许多人称它为\n泡沫。但这是真的吗，还是说我们实际上是在开始的早期阶段\n房价的大规模升值比我们已经看到的要多得多？\n\n首先，住房几乎只在20年以上的时间内上涨。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"房價、通貨膨脹和利率","the_new_excerpt":"每個人都知道住房市場一直非常熱，許多人稱它爲\n泡沫。但這是真的嗎，還是說我們實際上是在開始的早期階段\n房價的大規模升值比我們已經看到的要多得多？\n\n首先，住房幾乎只在20年以上的時間內上漲。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-47a1bd2c-161a-5fa2-931d-7ad6772c426b","excerpt":"A tweet making the rounds of an email received by a Peloton user\n[https://mashable.com/article/peloton-treadmill-monthly-subscription-required-just-run/]\nis showing that Peloton is no longer going to allow use of it's \"Just Run\"\nfeature on it's Tread units without a subscription.\n\nThis is absolutely…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o5vt01/big_change_for_peloton_will_no_longer_allow_use/","title":"Big Change for Peloton: Will No Longer Allow Use of Treadmill Without a Subscription","date":"June 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ペロトンの大きな変化 サブスクリプションなしではトレッドミルの使用ができなくなる","the_new_excerpt":"ペロトンのユーザーが受け取ったメールが話題になっているつぶやき\n[https://mashable.com/article/peloton-treadmill-monthly-subscription-required-just-run/]\nペロトンのユーザーが受け取ったメールのツイート[]によると、ペロトンはもはやTreadユニットの「Just Run」機能の使用を許可していないようです。\nペロトンは今後、Treadユニットの \"Just Run \"機能を、サブスクリプションなしで使用することはできません。\n\nこれは絶対に...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Peloton的巨大变化。将不再允许在没有订阅的情况下使用跑步机","the_new_excerpt":"Peloton用户收到的一封邮件的推文正在流传。\n[https://mashable.com/article/peloton-treadmill-monthly-subscription-required-just-run/]\n显示Peloton不再允许使用其 \"Just Run \"的功能。\n奔跑 \"功能，而不需要订阅。\n\n这绝对是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Peloton的巨大變化。將不再允許在沒有訂閱的情況下使用跑步機","the_new_excerpt":"Peloton用戶收到的一封郵件的推文正在流傳。\n[https://mashable.com/article/peloton-treadmill-monthly-subscription-required-just-run/]\n顯示Peloton不再允許使用其 \"Just Run \"的功能。\n奔跑 \"功能，而不需要訂閱。\n\n這絕對是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1406953657925570561","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1406953657925570561","title":"ok I'll try one of these https://t.co/1pbcaSEWKx","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 22, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"OK 私はこれらのいずれかを試してみます https://t.co/1pbcaSEWKx","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"好的，我将尝试其中的一个https://t.co/1pbcaSEWKx。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"好的，我將嘗試其中的一個https://t.co/1pbcaSEWKx。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-9d49b401-7bf3-5bfb-9123-d47cc5270a1c","previousId":"RedditPost-47a1bd2c-161a-5fa2-931d-7ad6772c426b","nextId":"TweetPost-1406953657925570561","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o5eahr/house_prices_inflation_and_interest_rates/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
