In a filing with the Hong Kong exchange, Evergrande said it requested the trading halt ahead of an announcement about a “major transaction.”</p>\n\n<p>Evergrande Property Services said that the announcement constitutes “a possible general offer for the shares of the Company.”</p>\n\n<p>Chinese developer Hopson also suspended trading of its shares, citing an impending announcement of a “major transaction” to acquire the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company, without specifying. Chinese state media Global Times reported, citing unnamed media reports, that Evergrande will sell about 51% of its property services arm to Hopson for more than $5 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Evergrande said it will sell a $1.5 billion stake in Shengjing Bank to a state-owned asset management firm.</p>\n\n<p>Evergrande’s debt has stoked investor concern as it warned twice it could default, roiling markets. The property giant has also missed interest payments on two offshore bonds in recent weeks, leaving overseas investors in limbo. So far, the firm has remained silent on those payments.</p>\n\n<p>Buckling under the weight of more than $300 billion in debt, Evergrande has been trying to offload stakes in other assets.</p>\n\n<p>It sold property units to suppliers and contractors to offset some of its outstanding payments. As of Aug. 27, those outstanding debts amounted to around 25.17 billion yuan ($3.8 billion), according to Evergrande’s latest financial statement.</p>\n\n<p>Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, said that “targeted and partial asset disposal to meet obligations is a fairly low bar.”</p>\n\n<p>“The real question is whether there will be sustainable financing/cash-flow arrangements to keep the property sector as a going-concern,” he told CNBC, referring to functioning businesses generating cash-flows rather than being squeezed by liquidation.</p>\n\n<p>Varathan added: “The wider point is that with a wall of obligations, restoring confidence is key. Whereas the general direction is still pointing to creditors making a bee-line and home-buyers being spooked.”</p>\n\n<p>Evergrande also faces another deadline — a dollar note worth $260 million, issued by Jumbo Fortune Enterprises and guaranteed by Evergrande, was set to mature on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>Non-payment would constitute a default and put pressure on the yuan, Varathan said</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/evergrande-set-to-sell-part-of-stake-in-property-services-unit.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/evergrande-set-to-sell-part-of-stake-in-property-services-unit.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q11us3/shares_of_evergrande_and_evergrande_property/","title":"Shares of Evergrande and Evergrande Property Services were halted Monday morning ahead of an announcement about a “major transaction.”","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-04T12:32:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-04 12:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q11us3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q11us3/shares_of_evergrande_and_evergrande_property/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q11us3/shares_of_evergrande_and_evergrande_property/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TaxShield","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TaxShield","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TaxShield","score":907,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Evergrande社とEvergrande Property Services社の株式は、\"主要な取引 \"に関する発表を前に、月曜日の朝に停止しました。","the_new_excerpt":"債務超過のデベロッパーであるEvergrande社は、同社の不動産サービス部門の株式の一部を売却する予定です。\nこれは、流動性を失った大手不動産会社が資金調達に奔走している中、数週間のうちに2回目の資産売却となる。\nこれは、流動性が低下した大手不動産会社が現金調達に奔走しているためです。\n\nEvergrandeとEvergrande Property Servicesの株式の取引は月曜日の朝に停止した。\n月曜日の朝。このような状況の中で","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在宣布一项 \"重大交易 \"之前，恒大和恒大地产服务的股票周一上午停牌。","the_new_excerpt":"负债累累的开发商恒大将出售其物业服务部门的部分股权。\n这是在几周内的第二次资产出售，因为这家流动性紧张的公司已经开始出售其物业服务部门的部分股权。\n地产巨头争相筹集现金。\n\n恒大和恒大地产服务的股票在周一上午停止交易。\n周一上午。恒大地产的股票在周一上午停牌。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在宣佈一項 \"重大交易 \"之前，恆大和恆大地產服務的股票週一上午停牌。","the_new_excerpt":"負債累累的開發商恆大將出售其物業服務部門的部分股權。\n這是在幾周內的第二次資產出售，因爲這家流動性緊張的公司已經開始出售其物業服務部門的部分股權。\n地產巨頭爭相籌集現金。\n\n恆大和恆大地產服務的股票在週一上午停止交易。\n週一上午。恆大地產的股票在週一上午停牌。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1444976778821394434","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1444976778821394434","title":"RT @RWMaloneMD: \"Tragedy In Rural Alberta, A Courageous Doctor Speaks Out.\"\n\"On the Steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery on Friday evening pa…","date":"October 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @RWMaloneMD: \"アルバータ州の田舎で起こった悲劇、勇気ある医師が語る。\"\n\"金曜日の夜、バンクーバーアートギャラリーの階段で、パ...","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"\"アルバータ州の田舎で起こった悲劇、勇気ある医師が語る\"\n\"過去の金曜日の夜、ニュルンベルグ・コード75周年を祝うバンクーバー・アート・ギャラリーの階段で、長瀬博士はこの力強いスピーチを行った。\"\nhttps://t.co/H8jXt8jABS"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @RWMaloneMD: \"阿尔伯塔省农村的悲剧，一位勇敢的医生大声疾呼。\"\n\"周五晚上，在温哥华艺术馆的台阶上，我看到了一位医生。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"\"阿尔伯塔省农村的悲剧，一位勇敢的医生大声疾呼\"。\n\"上周五晚上，在温哥华艺术馆的台阶上，为庆祝纽伦堡法典75周年，长濑博士发表了这一有力的演讲。\"\nhttps://t.co/H8jXt8jABS"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @RWMaloneMD: \"阿爾伯塔省農村的悲劇，一位勇敢的醫生大聲疾呼。\"\n\"週五晚上，在溫哥華藝術館的臺階上，我看到了一位醫生。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"\"阿爾伯塔省農村的悲劇，一位勇敢的醫生大聲疾呼\"。\n\"上週五晚上，在溫哥華藝術館的臺階上，爲慶祝紐倫堡法典75週年，長瀨博士發表了這一有力的演講。\"\nhttps://t.co/H8jXt8jABS"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1444848078918389761","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1444848078918389761","title":"Former product manager says Facebook hastily turned off safeguards after Biden beat Trump, helping pave path to deadly Capitol riot https://t.co/eZ3tfMhLrC","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 04, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"元プロダクトマネージャーによると、バイデンがトランプを打ち負かした後、フェイスブックは急いでセーフガードをオフにし、致命的な議事堂での暴動への道を開く手助けをした https://t.co/eZ3tfMhLrC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"前产品经理称拜登击败特朗普后Facebook匆忙关闭保障措施，帮助铺设致命的国会大厦骚乱之路 https://t.co/eZ3tfMhLrC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"前產品經理稱拜登擊敗特朗普後Facebook匆忙關閉保障措施，幫助鋪設致命的國會大廈騷亂之路 https://t.co/eZ3tfMhLrC","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q11us3","previousId":"TweetPost-1444976778821394434","nextId":"TweetPost-1444848078918389761","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q11us3/shares_of_evergrande_and_evergrande_property/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
