First to understand shorting ratios, you need to know what outstanding shares are. There are two:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shares Outstanding</strong></p>\n\n<p>The TOTAL NUMBER of shares a company has. Period. It includes: Owners, Insiders, Institutional, shares that are locked up, Available to general public, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shares Float</strong></p>\n\n<p>The total amount of shares to TRADE in the general Stock Market.</p>\n\n<p>Pretend: Stock XYZ has <em>400M shares float</em>, <em>50M shares shorted</em>, and <em>daily volume of 10M shares</em>. Now, let’s finally get to the shorting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Ratio</strong></p>\n\n<p>The number of <em>days</em> it would take ALL the shorts to cover their positions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Formula is: Shorted/Volume, so in this case: 50/10 = 5. It will take 5 days for ALL shorts to cover their positions if they were to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Short Float</strong></p>\n\n<p>What percentage of AVAILABLE shares (Shares float) are currently being shorted.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Formula is: ((Shorted/Available) * 100) shares. So, (50/400) * 100 = 12.5%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Short Interest</strong> <strong>(Shares Shorted)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Pretty much like Short Float. The quantity of stocks that investors have sold short but not yet covered or closed out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Squeeze</strong></p>\n\n<p>When stock price rises and the investors who shorted the stock are in RED getting a margin call. They have to immediately buy back the stock to close their position.</p>\n\n<p>But… how will they close GME? The diamond hands aren’t selling. They’re riding it to the moon.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Edit</em>: Thanks but please don&#39;t give me awards lol. Spend it buying stocks and getting rich. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l45btf/everything_you_need_to_know_about_shorting_ratio/","title":"Everything you need to know about Shorting: Ratio, Float, Interest, Squeeze","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T21:02:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 21:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a03a8c3d-9a00-542e-8ab3-189cd921adaf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l45btf/everything_you_need_to_know_about_shorting_ratio/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l45btf/everything_you_need_to_know_about_shorting_ratio/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"DiamondCock5","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DiamondCock5","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DiamondCock5","score":649,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你需要知道的关于做空的一切。比率，浮动，利息，挤压","the_new_excerpt":"感谢GME，我昨天毕业了，拿到了短训班的学士学位。\nYouTube大学的知识。\n\n围观的孩子们，我现在准备当教授了。首先要了解\n做空比例，你需要知道什么是流通股。有两种。\n\n流通股\n\nTOTAL...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你需要知道的關於做空的一切。比率，浮動，利息，擠壓","the_new_excerpt":"感謝GME，我昨天畢業了，拿到了短訓班的學士學位。\nYouTube大學的知識。\n\n圍觀的孩子們，我現在準備當教授了。首先要了解\n做空比例，你需要知道什麼是流通股。有兩種。\n\n流通股\n\nTOTAL...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8e342684-23a3-5671-a484-1db85af2f4e0","excerpt":"Hello investors,\n\n(for pictures, please refer to the original post)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/l3ugu7/market_commentary_how_about_that_gme_and_bb_craze/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nWow...
