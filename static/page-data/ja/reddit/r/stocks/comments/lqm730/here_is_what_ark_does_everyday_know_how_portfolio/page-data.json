If TSLA losses in value they buy more and if it gains more they sell it. They maintain a certain % of portfolio value. TSLA when in losing streak and they buy more to maintain the holding ratio.  As long as ARK doesnt increase the ratio of stock value in portfolio they&#39;re not adding any new positions - so following daily trade from ARK needs further analysis. </p>\n\n<p>ARK is always be trimming or compensating gains and losses so no one position eats up their most part of ETF value.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lqm730/here_is_what_ark_does_everyday_know_how_portfolio/","title":"Here is what ARK does everyday - Know how portfolio rebalancing works","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T18:13:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 18:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b450e5cc-1bf8-5c3c-bb4c-0f7f54cd9b82","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqm730/here_is_what_ark_does_everyday_know_how_portfolio/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqm730/here_is_what_ark_does_everyday_know_how_portfolio/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"x-w-j","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/x-w-j","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"x-w-j","score":205,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"以下是ARK每天的工作内容--了解投资组合再平衡的工作原理","the_new_excerpt":"我已经看到好几个帖子盲目地跟着ARK做什么。最近...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是ARK每天的工作內容--瞭解投資組合再平衡的工作原理","the_new_excerpt":"我已經看到好幾個帖子盲目地跟着ARK做什麼。最近...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1364252338974777344","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1364252338974777344","title":"Tesla shareholders explaining their losses to energy investors https://t.co/WCbx35qib8","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"特斯拉股东向能源投资者解释其损失https://t.co/WCbx35qib8。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"特斯拉股東向能源投資者解釋其損失https://t.co/WCbx35qib8。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-1b0af91c-3b39-54c5-ba76-e53b4ca53100","excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-text/fed-chair-powells-prepared-remarks-to-congress-feb-23-2021-idUSKBN2AN1LT\n\n> As described in the February Monetary Policy Report, in August, the Committee\n> unanimously adopted its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary\n> Policy…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lqlqbm/fed_chair_powells_prepared_remarks_to_congress/","title":"Fed Chair Powell's prepared remarks to Congress, Feb. 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 23, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2021年2月23日，美联储主席鲍威尔向国会发表的准备讲话。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-text/fed-chair-powells-prepared-remarks-to-congress-feb-23-2021-idUSKBN2AN1LT\n\n>正如2月份货币政策报告中所述，8月份，该委员会\n> 一致通过了经修订的《关于长期目标和货币的声明》。\n> 政策...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年2月23日，美聯儲主席鮑威爾向國會發表的準備講話。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-text/fed-chair-powells-prepared-remarks-to-congress-feb-23-2021-idUSKBN2AN1LT\n\n>正如2月份貨幣政策報告中所述，8月份，該委員會\n> 一致通過了經修訂的《關於長期目標和貨幣的聲明》。\n> 政策...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-b450e5cc-1bf8-5c3c-bb4c-0f7f54cd9b82","previousId":"TweetPost-1364252338974777344","nextId":"RedditPost-1b0af91c-3b39-54c5-ba76-e53b4ca53100","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lqm730/here_is_what_ark_does_everyday_know_how_portfolio/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
