This week will be a massive one for earnings, with tech mega-caps Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG), among many other very important companies, reporting earnings.</p>\n\n<p>Last Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed that the Fed is “on track: to begin slowing the pace of quantitative easing, signaling that the US economy has recovered enough to sustain reduced Fed stimulus starting as soon as next month. I have been saying for months that I expected tapering to begin either November or December or this year. He said, “I do think it’s time to taper, and I don’t think it’s time to raise rates.” This is music to my ears, I have also been saying for months that I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing the possibility of raising interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>In the September meeting minutes, the Fed noted that “Participants generally assessed that, provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track, a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate. </p>\n\n<p>Market participants are encouraged that despite persistent supply-side disruptions, which have only intensified as the holiday season kicks off, and labor market imbalances stemming from the pandemic. Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-November or mid-December.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As of Friday, about 23% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results for the third quarter, and of these, 84% topped Wall Street&#39;s expectations for earnings per share (EPS), according to data from FactSet. The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 was 32.7%, based on actual results and expectations for companies still yet to report as of last week. If maintained through the end of Q3 earnings season, that would mark the third-highest earnings growth rate posted for the index since 2010. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-22-2021\">https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-22-2021</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook (FB) reported earnings and the stock is gapping up at the time of writing.
