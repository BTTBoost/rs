I went into investing with a “Get rich quick” mindset, only to figure out that it is quite the opposite (laugh at me it’s ok). I feel that I am certainly not the only one that thought this way. After, I took the time to read articles and attempt to really try and understand, to which I had more of an appreciation of the market and was able to make educated guesses, and at the very least, able to understand the key terms and economics of the market. Don’t be afraid to ask questions here, and find those resources that can help you learn. </p>\n\n<p>No one is going to get rich for you, you have to be the one to take the initiative yourself :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q2j1gd/my_professor_asked_a_great_question_in_class/","title":"My professor asked a great question in class.
