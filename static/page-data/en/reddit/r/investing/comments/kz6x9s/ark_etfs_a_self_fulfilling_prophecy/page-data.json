After the trade notification report of ARKW&#39;s 497k shares purchase in PLTR was released after trading hours, reddit/stocktwit community immediately started to share about the news and it further amplified the news to a huge extent, where it popped 11% the next day after opening before inching back down.</p>\n\n<p>Or another one would be the recent announcement to start a ARK Space ETF - and space related stocks were soaring on the very next day.</p>\n\n<p>This phenomenon almost seems like the Midas Touch, where she has the ability to touch (or invest) anything into gold due to her almighty influence.
