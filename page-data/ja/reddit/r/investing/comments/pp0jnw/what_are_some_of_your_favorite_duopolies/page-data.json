Many industries also mature to the point where it&#39;s only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. </p>\n\n<p>My question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I&#39;ll start: </p>\n\n<p>$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. </p>\n\n<p>$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. </p>\n\n<p>Semiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. </p>\n\n<p>What are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pp0jnw/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_duopolies/","title":"What are some of your favorite duopolies?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-16T05:32:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-16 05:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pp0jnw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pp0jnw/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_duopolies/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pp0jnw/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_duopolies/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"p_giggles","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/p_giggles","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"p_giggles","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"好きなデュオポリーは何ですか？","the_new_excerpt":"デュオポリーで活動する企業は、新規参入者の影響を受けにくいため、広い堀を持ち、良好な財務パフォーマンスを実現しています。\n参入障壁が高いため、新規参入者の影響を受けにくく、良好な財務パフォーマンスを実現しています。\n参入障壁が高いからです。また、多くの産業は成熟しており\n一握りの企業しか利益を上げられないほど成熟していることもあります。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你最喜欢的二元垄断企业有哪些？","the_new_excerpt":"在双头垄断中运营的公司往往有宽阔的护城河，提供良好的\n的财务业绩，因为它们不太容易受到新进入者的影响，这通常是由于进入门槛高。\n往往是由于较高的进入壁垒。许多行业也成熟到了这样的地步\n只有少数几家公司的经营是有利可图的。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你最喜歡的二元壟斷企業有哪些？","the_new_excerpt":"在雙頭壟斷中運營的公司往往有寬闊的護城河，提供良好的\n的財務業績，因爲它們不太容易受到新進入者的影響，這通常是由於進入門檻高。\n往往是由於較高的進入壁壘。許多行業也成熟到了這樣的地步\n只有少數幾家公司的經營是有利可圖的。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pou8ta","excerpt":"I have been investing for some time now and used to just take 100% of the\nprofits to lock it in.
