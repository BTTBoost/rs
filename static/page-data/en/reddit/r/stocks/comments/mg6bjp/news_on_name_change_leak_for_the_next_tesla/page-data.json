Shares shot up earlier this month after the company laid out more ambitious EV goals.</p>\n\n<p>The name change isn’t the only thing affecting shares. The stock is getting a lift after an upgrade by Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois. On Sunday, he raised his rating to Buy from Hold and increased his price target for preferred stock to about $350 a share from $235.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mg6bjp/news_on_name_change_leak_for_the_next_tesla/","title":"News on Name Change Leak for the Next Tesla: Voltswagen (VOW, VWAGY)","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-30T06:56:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-30 06:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3bc99022-2a09-5345-a8a9-6a3e8bb17f68","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mg6bjp/news_on_name_change_leak_for_the_next_tesla/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mg6bjp/news_on_name_change_leak_for_the_next_tesla/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Torlek1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Torlek1","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Torlek1","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"关于下一款特斯拉改名的消息泄露。大众汽车（VOW，VWAGY)","the_new_excerpt":"大众意外泄露了其美国业务的新名称。Voltswagen\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html]\n\n摘录\n\n> 发布会上说，更名 \"预计将于5月生效\"，并且\n> 称为 \"公开声明的改变...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於下一款特斯拉改名的消息泄露。大衆汽車（VOW，VWAGY)","the_new_excerpt":"大衆意外泄露了其美國業務的新名稱。Voltswagen\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html]\n\n摘錄\n\n> 發佈會上說，更名 \"預計將於5月生效\"，並且\n> 稱爲 \"公開聲明的改變...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-477a4782-f673-5c48-92e2-7502a70f6e34","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mg61vj/now_finance_insider_wants_to_add_their_2_cents_on/","title":"Now Finance Insider wants to add their 2 cents on WSB.
