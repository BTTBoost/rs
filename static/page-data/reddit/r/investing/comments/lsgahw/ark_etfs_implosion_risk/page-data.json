This could force very painful liquidations at unfavorable prices and the ensuing crash goes into a positive feedback loop leading into a death spiral enticing even more outflows and predatory shorts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","title":"ARK ETFs implosion risk ------------------------","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T22:26:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 22:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"379ddaad-e96c-5891-ab76-546a692485d4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Whiskerfield","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Whiskerfield","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Whiskerfield","score":98,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ARK ETF内爆风险 ------------------------","the_new_excerpt":"鉴于近期股市的低迷，尤其是科技股的低迷，这很可能会影响股市的发展。\n随着收益率的不断上升，我认为应该谨慎地分享一下\n投资ARK ETF的风险，《熊穴》写得非常好。\n[https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/special-edition-will-ark-invest-blow]....","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARK ETF內爆風險 ------------------------","the_new_excerpt":"鑑於近期股市的低迷，尤其是科技股的低迷，這很可能會影響股市的發展。\n隨着收益率的不斷上升，我認爲應該謹慎地分享一下\n投資ARK ETF的風險，《熊穴》寫得非常好。\n[https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/special-edition-will-ark-invest-blow]....","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-41cf0da5-9708-5dac-89e8-18f6398a928d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lscure/america_meet_gamestop_were_not_fucking_leaving/","title":"America, Meet GameStop: WE'RE NOT FUCKING LEAVING 💎🙌💎 FOR LIFE","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"美国，迎接GameStop：我们不会他妈的离开💎🙌💎终身。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國，迎接GameStop：我們不會他媽的離開💎🙌💎終身。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-50d26c21-3060-5fbf-ac45-95c2939fd2fd","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8u0y/bloomberg_gme_shortsellers_estimated_to_have_lost/","title":"[Bloomberg] $GME Short-sellers estimated to have lost $818,000,000 on their bearish bets on Wednesday.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"[彭博]$GME空头估计在周三的看空押注中损失了8.18亿美元。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"[彭博]$GME空頭估計在週三的看空押注中損失了8.18億美元。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-379ddaad-e96c-5891-ab76-546a692485d4","previousId":"RedditPost-41cf0da5-9708-5dac-89e8-18f6398a928d","nextId":"RedditPost-50d26c21-3060-5fbf-ac45-95c2939fd2fd","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lsgahw/ark_etfs_implosion_risk/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
