Just recently state miner Codelco’s copper production for the month of August took a dip, going down by 6.7% year-on-year to 144,500 tonnes due to a strike in one of their mines. BHP, another big company, showed a drop in their copper production as well because their Escondida mine has issues in operation due to the imposed restriction caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Chile is the top producer in the world when it comes to copper, so the production getting affected is a big deal.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is also the problem with property giant China Evergrande Group. The company encountered a debt crisis that caused copper prices to fall, fueling worries about the demand for the metal. The price touched at $4.090 per pound ($8,998 per tonne) on the Comex market in New York. Though it seemed to have bounced back recently after they announced a deal over a $35.9 million bond interest payment.</p>\n\n<p>Because of all these. I’m contemplating if it’s still smart to invest in it. I’ve been looking into some recently. I got my eyes on bigger ones like BHP and FCX (especially this one, I heard a lot of good things about it). I feel like it is safer to invest in these since they are already big producers.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also looking into some juniors though because of the return I might get despite the risks of investing in it. I’m also prioritizing diversifying my portfolio. I kind of like the <a href=\"https://www.westminingcorp.ca/\">West Mining Corp</a>. (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/WEST:CNSX?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZ-JOH5dPzAhUwGKYKHTw0AGwQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw\">CSE: WEST</a>) (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WESMF/\">OTC: WESMF</a>), a company that already commenced their diamond drilling program on the <a href=\"https://www.westminingcorp.ca/kena-project\">Kena Copper Zone</a> area of its 100% owned Kena gold and copper project in southeastern British Columbia. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.solarisresources.com/\">Solaris Resources</a> (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SLS:TSE?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiBqP2l5dPzAhXnxYsBHY1hCqAQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw\">TSX: SLS</a>) (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/\">OTCQB: SLSSF</a>), who is showing great promise and is now currently drilling, recently released results from their ongoing resource expansion drilling at its Warintza Project where they were able to <a href=\"https://www.solarisresources.com/news/press-releases/solaris-reports-1000m-of-081-cueq-from-surface-broadens-width-of-warintza-central-to-north-in-165m-step-out-hole\">discover 1,000m of 0.81% CuEq¹ from near-surface.</a> They have extended the drill defined envelope of high-grade mineralization encountered in all holes starting at or near-surface.</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to need your thoughts. Am I too late in this? Is it risky to invest on copper now?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qal197/is_it_still_ideal_to_invest_in_copper_stocks/","title":"Is it still ideal to invest in copper stocks?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-18T13:55:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-18 13:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qal197","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qal197/is_it_still_ideal_to_invest_in_copper_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qal197/is_it_still_ideal_to_invest_in_copper_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"passpelly","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/passpelly","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"passpelly","score":126,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"銅の銘柄に投資するのはやはり理想的なのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"このような状況の中で、投資することがまだ良いことなのかどうかを考えさせられています。\n考えるようになりました。先日、国営鉱山のコデルコの8月の銅生産量が前年同月比6.7％減の14万4500トンと落ち込んだ。\n8月の銅生産量は、前年同月比6.7％減の14万4500トンとなりました。\nこれは、同社の鉱山のひとつでストライキが起きたためです。同じく大企業のBHPも...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"投资铜股是否仍然理想？","the_new_excerpt":"随着这一切的发生，它让我思考，如果投资它是\n仍然是一个好主意。就在最近，国有矿商Codelco公司8月份的铜产量出现下滑，同比下降6.7%至14.45万吨。\n8月份的铜产量出现下滑，同比下降6.7%至144,500吨。\n因为他们的一个矿场发生了罢工。另一家大公司BHP，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資銅股是否仍然理想？","the_new_excerpt":"隨着這一切的發生，它讓我思考，如果投資它是\n仍然是一個好主意。就在最近，國有礦商Codelco公司8月份的銅產量出現下滑，同比下降6.7%至14.45萬噸。\n8月份的銅產量出現下滑，同比下降6.7%至144,500噸。\n因爲他們的一個礦場發生了罷工。另一家大公司BHP，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qak967","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qak967/never_go_full_wall_street_bets_on_national_tv/","title":"Never go full Wall Street Bets on national TV","date":"October 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"全国放送でウォールストリート・ベットをフル活用することはない","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"永远不要在国家电视台上全面报道华尔街的赌局","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"永遠不要在國家電視臺上全面報道華爾街的賭局","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qamr6g","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/the-wealthiest-10percent-of-americans-own-a-record-89percent-of-all-us-stocks.html\n\nThe wealthiest 10% of Americans now own 89% of all U.S. stocks, a record high\nthat highlights the stock market’s role in increasing wealth inequality.
