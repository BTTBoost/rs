I can probably take up to $350k cash out at 2.875% for a 30 year fix but points and closing costs are gonna cost about $10k. I recently refi-ed down to 2.625% on a 30 year fix about 9 months ago. I&#39;ll probably use about $150k for home renovations, then put $150k in FSKAX and keep $50k liquid or invest in a total bond fund and use that money to pay for part of the new higher monthly mortgage payments. By my calculations, that $50k could last around 3 years for the higher mortgage payments. After that, I hope to use proceeds from the $150k investment, my higher income, and extra income to pay the higher monthly payments. Monthly mortgage will probably increase $1,400 a month. I plan to stay in this home for at least the 10 years if not more.</p>\n\n<p>The way I look at it, this is a long term investment. Take a low interest rate for my loan and use it to get a higher compounded interest return over the long run. I&#39;m 43 and probably won&#39;t need this money for 20 - 30 years. Right now I have $400k in retirement and this year will be the first year I&#39;m putting in around $30k in retirement ($20k in 401k, $6k Roth, and another $4k extra). I have 6 months of emergency money in cash too. I have a pretty stable job that should probably continue to go up in income as the years go. I have a 12 and 7 year old and have a decent college fund for both of them. my partner just started her own business a year ago and is self-sustaining now and hopefully will grow bigger profits  next year.</p>\n\n<p>my question to the community is: Do you think this is a good investment strategy? How risky is it do borrow this much money to make potentially a lot more retirement money? Am I missing anything in my strategy? Pros and Cons? Should I take a smaller cash out so I don&#39;t have to worry about paying a huge increase in my monthly mortgage payments? Any thoughts are appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Chris</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p3he7h/cash_out_refi_to_use_part_of_money_to_invest_in/","title":"Cash out refi to use part of money to invest in FSKAX","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"August 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-13T19:07:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-13 19:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"fb036063-45dc-5c1c-96f1-c960645d36d6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p3he7h/cash_out_refi_to_use_part_of_money_to_invest_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/p3he7h/cash_out_refi_to_use_part_of_money_to_invest_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"Traditional_Gold_531","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Traditional_Gold_531","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Traditional_Gold_531","score":16,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"キャッシュアウト・リファイで資金の一部をFSKAXへの投資に充てる","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。\n\n経済的にかなり大きな決断を迫られているので、アドバイスをお願いします。\n家の改装のためにキャッシュアウト・リファイを考えていて、残りのお金を低金利の\nFSKAXのような低手数料の総合株価指数に蓄えようと考えています。\n現在の住宅ローンは35万ドルで、最近の評価では...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"套现再融资，用部分资金投资于FSKAX","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n\n我想就一个相当大的财务决定征求一些建议。\n我想做一个现金出让的再融资，做一些房屋装修，然后把剩下的钱藏在一个低费用的总股票指数里，比如FSKAX，基本上和VTSAX一样。\n入一个低费用的总股票指数，如FSKAX，基本上与VTSAX相同。\n目前的房屋贷款是35万美元，最近的评估说我的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"套現再融資，用部分資金投資於FSKAX","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n\n我想就一個相當大的財務決定徵求一些建議。\n我想做一個現金出讓的再融資，做一些房屋裝修，然後把剩下的錢藏在一個低費用的總股票指數裏，比如FSKAX，基本上和VTSAX一樣。\n入一個低費用的總股票指數，如FSKAX，基本上與VTSAX相同。\n目前的房屋貸款是35萬美元，最近的評估說我的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-7346ef7d-919c-5032-af99-1f604a3ea509","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3loc8/121k_clov_yolo/","title":"$121k+ $CLOV YOLO","date":"August 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"121k+ $CLOV YOLO","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"12.1万+$CLOV YOLO","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"12.1萬+$CLOV YOLO","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1426217803904913409","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1426217803904913409","title":"Real 10-Year Treasury yields fall below -4%, lowest level since 1980. $TNX\n\nCharting via @ycharts https://t.co/8XepYYuIyM","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 13, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"実質10年債利回りは-4%を下回り、1980年以来の低水準に。$TNX\n\nCharting via @ycharts https://t.co/8XepYYuIyM","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"10年期国债实际收益率跌破-4%，为1980年以来的最低水平。$TNX\n\n图表通过@ycharts https://t.co/8XepYYuIyM","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"10年期國債實際收益率跌破-4%，爲1980年以來的最低水平。$TNX\n\n圖表通過@ycharts https://t.co/8XepYYuIyM","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-fb036063-45dc-5c1c-96f1-c960645d36d6","previousId":"RedditPost-7346ef7d-919c-5032-af99-1f604a3ea509","nextId":"TweetPost-1426217803904913409","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p3he7h/cash_out_refi_to_use_part_of_money_to_invest_in/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
