The Nasdaq (QQQ) closed roughly even, as the rally in technology stocks takes a breather. The Dow Jones (DIA), which lagged the other two major indexes for all of June, continued its recovery. </p>\n\n<p>Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and the incoming June Jobs Report, which is expected to be released tomorrow. </p>\n\n<p>ADP’s June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html\">.</a> This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans&#39; increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board&#39;s consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. </p>\n\n<p>During the second quarter, the technology, communication, real estate, and energy sectors were the best performers, underscoring the rotation from “reopening” and cyclical stocks that led the market higher earlier in the year back into technology and growth stocks. The rotation coincided with tempered fears, with the market rocketing higher after an initial 4% sell-off following the release of the April Consumer Price Index. It seems the market has now accepted Powell and other monetary official’s narrative that current inflationary pressures are “transitory” and due mostly to pandemic-induced disruptions.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, market participants wait for the June Jobs Report and are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS&#39;s Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be &quot;need to be revised higher.&quot; </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Robinhood filed its S-1 Prospectus, marking a significant step forward as the company prepares for an upcoming IPO using the ticker HOOD. According to the S-1, Robinhood has 17.7 million monthly active users, with nearly 50% of those being first-time investors. Total revenue grew 245% to $959 million between the end of December 2019 and December 2020. The company was profitable in 2020, improving from a loss in 2019, but lost $1.4 billion in the first three months of 2021 amid the Gamestop frenzy that happened earlier in the year. This will be very interesting to watch, I have my popcorn out and ready to see what unfolds. </li>\n<li>Shares of donut-maker Krispy Kreme (DNUT) popped in today’s IPO, with the stock rising roughly 23% after trading became open to the public.</li>\n<li>U.S. manufacturing sector activity retreated more than expected in June, reaching the lowest level since January. The Institute for Supply Management&#39;s June purchasing managers&#39; index, a monthly indicator of U.S. economic activity based on a survey of purchasing managers at more than 300 manufacturing firms, fell to 60.6. This came following a print of 61.2 in May, and came in below the 60.9 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data. As long as the number is over 50 though, it shows growth in the sector. </li>\n<li>Facebook (FB) has teamed up with French video game maker Ubisoft Entertainment SA to bolster its cloud-gaming platform with popular titles such as &quot;Assassin&#39;s Creed&quot;. In recent weeks competition for cloud-based gaming platforms between mega-cap tech stocks has intensified, with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN) all ramping up their efforts.</li>\n<li>Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) rose roughly 15% today, recovering after a disappointing IPO debut yesterday. </li>\n<li>Megan Thee Stallion is following in the footsteps of fellow celebrity Miley Cyrus by partnering with financial payments company Square (SQ) Cash App to give away $1 million worth of stock to her fans, another sign the push for retail investors and education is going ever more mainstream.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>ConocoPhillips (COP) with a host of target raises.
