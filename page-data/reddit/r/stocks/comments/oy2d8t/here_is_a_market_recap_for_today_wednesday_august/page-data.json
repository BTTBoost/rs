The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, fell 1.25%. It seems market participants were disappointed by a report from ADP, a leading employment services company, which estimated that private employers added half the expected amount of jobs in July. This sets a negative backdrop for the official July Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. </p>\n\n<p>ADP, a leading payroll and human services software company, released its July 2021 Employment Report, which estimated that private employers added only 330,000 jobs in July, less than half the 690,000 gain expected by economists. While ADP’s report isn’t 100% accurate, it’s usually fairly close and sets a negative backdrop for the official July Job Report on Friday. ADP’s report shows that the labor market imbalances stemming from the coronavirus pandemic remain. Moreover, with concerns surrounding the Delta variant increasing, that could be a relatively new factor adding more pressure. Here is the entire report: <a href=\"https://adpemploymentreport.com/\">https://adpemploymentreport.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida emerging as the US’ new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. </p>\n\n<p>So far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. </p>\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of Lyft (LYFT) fell roughly 10% despite posting its first profitable quarter. Earnings are very weird.</li>\n<li>Shares of GM slipped 8% after posting earnings.</li>\n<li>Shares of NovaVax (NVAX) gapped up roughly 20$ after the company announced an agreement with the EU to sell up to 200 million COVID vaccines. </li>\n<li>Shares of some Chinese companies somewhat after pulling back yesterday following signaling that the CCP may be targeting video game companies next as the regulatory crackdown on tech stocks continues. Yesterday, shares of Tencent (TCEHY) and other tech stocks fell after a state-media called video games &quot;spiritual opium&quot;. This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. </li>\n<li>Shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up again today, rising roughly 50% today.</li>\n<li>Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said Wednesday the central bank is still on track to begin raising rates off their current near-zero levels in 2023, as long as the economic recovery remains on its current trajectory. He said “While, as Chair Powell indicated last week, we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates and this is certainly not something on the radar screen right now, if the outlook for inflation and outlook for unemployment I summarized earlier turn out to be the actual outcomes for inflation and unemployment realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022.”</li>\n<li>**<strong>Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Akami Technologies (AKAM) with two target raises.
