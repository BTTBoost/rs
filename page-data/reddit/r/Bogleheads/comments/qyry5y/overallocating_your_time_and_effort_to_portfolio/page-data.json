So yeah, it might be worth it to keep in mind that it is suboptimal to overallocate one&#39;s resources towards portfolio optimization. </p>\n\n<p>Now if I know myself, the danger is that I&#39;ll spend the next four months designing and refining the perfect allocation of my time and mental efforts towards my various work and life objectives rather than doing what I am supposed to do... :-)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qyry5y/overallocating_your_time_and_effort_to_portfolio/","title":"Overallocating your time and effort to portfolio optimization is suboptimal","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-21T13:03:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-21 13:03","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qyry5y","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qyry5y/overallocating_your_time_and_effort_to_portfolio/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qyry5y/overallocating_your_time_and_effort_to_portfolio/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"Lyrolepis","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lyrolepis","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Lyrolepis","score":17,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ポートフォリオの最適化に時間と労力を割くことは最適ではない","the_new_excerpt":"これがどれほど一般的なことなのかはわかりませんが、これは私が気付いた戦略的なミスであり、考えてみる価値はあると思います。\nこれは考えてみる価値があると思います。\n\nポートフォリオについて研究したり、バックテストをしたりするのは楽しいことです。\n時間をかけて設計することが重要であることには同意しますが・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"将你的时间和精力过度分配给投资组合优化是次优的。","the_new_excerpt":"我不知道这种情况有多普遍，但这是我意识到的一个战略错误。\n我认为这可能值得思考。\n\n对投资组合进行研究和回溯测试等等是很有趣的，我知道。\n我知道，我当然同意，花时间设计投资组合是很重要的。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"將你的時間和精力過度分配給投資組合優化是次優的。","the_new_excerpt":"我不知道這種情況有多普遍，但這是我意識到的一個戰略錯誤。\n我認爲這可能值得思考。\n\n對投資組合進行研究和回溯測試等等是很有趣的，我知道。\n我知道，我當然同意，花時間設計投資組合是很重要的。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qykw6v","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qykw6v/tesla_over_the_weekend_when_i_dont_own_calls_vs/","title":"Tesla over the weekend when i don’t own calls vs when i own calls","date":"November 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"週末のテスラは、コールを持っていないときと、コールを持っているときの比較","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"周末，当我不持有看涨期权时，特斯拉与我持有看涨期权时，特斯拉。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"週末，當我不持有看漲期權時，特斯拉與我持有看漲期權時，特斯拉。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qyry5y","previousId":"RedditPost-qykw6v","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qyry5y/overallocating_your_time_and_effort_to_portfolio/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
