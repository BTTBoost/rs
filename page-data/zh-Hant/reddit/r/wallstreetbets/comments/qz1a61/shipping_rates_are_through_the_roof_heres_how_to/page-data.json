I have literally looked at the top 12 largest, publicly-traded shipping companies and this one seems to have the greatest mismatch on price:value. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Margins</strong></p>\n\n<p>$ZIM has one of (if not, the) highest margins of any shipping company in the industry with a 66% EBITDA margin (that&#39;s double $APPL). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rate of growth</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whether it has been their shipping fleet acquisitions, the freight prices, or efficient logistics $ZIM has 18X&#39;d their profit YoY. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b\">https://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stock Performance</strong></p>\n\n<p>$ZIM went public in January this year and has averaged a 100% return every quarter. For a <strong>REAL</strong> company, this is unparalleled. They literally just go up and to the right. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ptd3omdjlz081.png?width=2522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81cc178b902e40d8a4002aff7948ff657e4d5166\">https://preview.redd.it/ptd3omdjlz081.png?width=2522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81cc178b902e40d8a4002aff7948ff657e4d5166</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price Mismatch</strong></p>\n\n<p>After looking at the top 12 highest market cap shipping companies, $ZIM seems to be the most mispriced. The average PE of the shipping industry is  ~6.9X (nice). While $ZIM trades @ 3.3X. Even if $ZIM were to normalize at the industry&#39;s average, that&#39;s over a 100% return. If you look at revenue, $ZIM brings in roughly 20% of Maersk&#39;s $AMKBY (the largest shipping company by MC) revenue while trading at ~10% of the valuation.  If you were to normalize $ZIM (66% margin) with $AMKBY (41% margin) based upon net profit, you&#39;d expect a 130% return from the current price of $57. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6wve2xa8tz081.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e2984facc1c048ebec1529ea691d516ad1161cb\">Comparison across some shipping companies.</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Next Run</strong></p>\n\n<p>After $ZIM completely destroyed their Q3 earnings ($12.16 vs $8.99 EPS) and announced a market-leading dividend (20% of quarter&#39;s net income with a 4th quarter dividend equal to 30-50% of annual net income), and heavy volume has started coming in over the last few days. People are starting to notice. If we assume a similar profit for Q4, their &#39;21 annual profit is ~$4.5B. We know that based on shares outstanding divided by net income with a 20% dividend is $2.50. This means that their 4th quarter dividend (assumed at the midpoint of 40%) will be $15. At a current share price of $57, you&#39;d basically get <strong>a 26% return just from a single dividend.</strong>  If you don&#39;t think boomers and pensions that love dividends aren&#39;t going to jump into this stock then go YOLO into some weed stocks (RIP. Long $ROPE). </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n\n<p>$ZIM&#39;s ex-dividend date is Dec 15th so, if you&#39;d like the dividend (like me) you&#39;d have to get in before that date. If you think the stock will massively skyrocket from dividend investors, here&#39;s the options chain. You&#39;ll notice the most volume taking place at the $60 strike calls. These calls also have the greatest #gamma and could offer a great return with a breakeven price of $62.60. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/187r26jnqz081.png?width=2574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3f502b943a2717b68a7a813f87e02fb99a2d554\">https://preview.redd.it/187r26jnqz081.png?width=2574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3f502b943a2717b68a7a813f87e02fb99a2d554</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Positions</strong></p>\n\n<p>100 shares @ $57.50</p>\n\n<p><strong>*This is literally my uneducated, unlicensed opinion.
