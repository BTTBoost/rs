He has apparently got a little lucky on $TSLA lately and made some good money for a 15 year old, (I&#39;m assuming he is using his parents&#39; outside account).</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I got on the phone with him, I noticed an air of superiority. After discussing his &quot;investment strategy&quot; with him for a moment he started to tell me he knows more about investing than I ever will. Keep in mind he says he has been &quot;investing&quot; for 2 months. Then he hit me with this quote, which I will never forget in my entire life:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Long term investments are for pussies. I dont want to drive a ferrari when I&#39;m 60 if I could when I&#39;m 16&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You people are creating an entire generation of autists.

I do genuinely apologize if I have offended anybody, though.
