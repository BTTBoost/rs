(“Wanda”) converted its Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class B common stock”) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), into an equal number of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”). No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.</p>\n\n<p>The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section M of the Charter, which provides that each share of Class B common stock shall be convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company. Pursuant to Article IV, Section M, the shares of Class B common stock that are converted pursuant to this section shall be retired by the Company and shall not be available for issuance.</p>\n\n<p>The conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of the Class B common stock:</p>\n\n<p>Voting Power. Prior to the conversion, Wanda as the holder of shares of Class B common stock was entitled to three votes per share of Class B common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company’s shareholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class A common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a shareholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Charter and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion.</p>\n\n<p>Economic Interests. Because holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to the same economic interests to which Wanda was entitled with respect to its Class B common stock before the conversion, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction, the conversion had no impact on the economic interests of Wanda.  </p>\n\n<p>Capitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class B common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. The conversion also had no impact on the Company&#39;s total number of authorized shares of capital stock.”</p>\n\n<p>How will this likely affect the stock?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ldlvak/what_does_this_mean_for_amc_stock_form_8k_filed/","title":"What does this mean for AMC stock?
