Many come from different walks of life, but more often than not, thing like careers and the economy came up.</p>\n\n<p>People would shoot the shit on markets and how their investments were doing. Mind you, most of these people were 50+, while I am in my mid-30s. Among my 6 or 7 conversations, there was a common thread. Not one single person really knew about individual index funds. The only extent they did know was that some Vanguard names sit in their 401K, which was provided by their employers.</p>\n\n<p>When it came down to things they actually managed themselves, I heard a lot about the following:</p>\n\n<p>- Individual company stocks (Usually from their own company or companies their employer did business with because they &quot;trusted&quot; them)</p>\n\n<p>- Assets like gold and silver</p>\n\n<p>- Real Estate, not just their own homes, but buying other things like condos and second homes they would sparingly use in hopes of selling them later</p>\n\n<p>This struck me as a bit odd, because the general consensus I can find via research is that index investing is the single most stable form of investing and the easiest to generally do. Why would a generation like the boomers, who I consider more risk adverse these days, not be all over this?</p>\n\n<p>At first glance, it seems index investing didn&#39;t really gain traction until the 2000s. (VTI was made in 2001) I also got the impression that strategies such as investing in gold and real estate were considered very common among that generation.</p>\n\n<p>Would any Bogleheads have some light to shed on why this may be the case? It may have just been coincidence from the people I spoke with.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/po6287/boomers_and_bogleheads_an_observation/","title":"Boomers and Bogleheads - An Observation","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"September 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-15T02:13:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-15 02:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"po6287","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/po6287/boomers_and_bogleheads_an_observation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/po6287/boomers_and_bogleheads_an_observation/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"donemessedup123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/donemessedup123","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"donemessedup123","score":36,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ブーマーとボーグルヘッズの観察","the_new_excerpt":"この1ヶ月間、私は婚約者と自分の親戚をたくさん訪問していました。\n訪ねています。多くの親戚は様々な分野で活躍していますが、多くの場合、キャリアや経済の話が出てきます。\nキャリアや経済の話になります。\n\n人々は市場や自分の投資がどのように行われているかについて話していました。\nしかし、これらのほとんどは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"潮汕人和博格瑞特人--一个观察报告","the_new_excerpt":"在过去的一个月里，我一直在拜访我的未婚夫和我自己这边的很多亲戚。\n自己这边。许多人来自不同的生活领域，但更多的时候，像职业和经济这样的事情被提及。\n诸如职业和经济问题。\n\n人们会就市场和他们的投资情况进行讨论。\n提醒你，这些人中的大多数...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"潮汕人和博格瑞特人--一個觀察報告","the_new_excerpt":"在過去的一個月裏，我一直在拜訪我的未婚夫和我自己這邊的很多親戚。\n自己這邊。許多人來自不同的生活領域，但更多的時候，像職業和經濟這樣的事情被提及。\n諸如職業和經濟問題。\n\n人們會就市場和他們的投資情況進行討論。\n提醒你，這些人中的大多數...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-poe1mi","excerpt":"Just found this out yesterday, and as an Oregon native I am kind of pumped (no\npun intended).
