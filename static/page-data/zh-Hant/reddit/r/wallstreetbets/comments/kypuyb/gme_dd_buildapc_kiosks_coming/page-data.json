I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they &quot;have&quot; a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don&#39;t actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn&#39;t display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don&#39;t move fast, because that store specifically, among &quot;3-4 others in the state&quot; are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as &quot;PC building stations&quot;.</strong>  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p><strong>3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. </p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, I haven&#39;t seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty &quot;in-the-know&quot; to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!</p>\n\n<p>She also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the &quot;Next blockbuster!1!!!&quot; thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Positions: 250 shares @22.30 cost avg, 2x 4/19/21 $30c, 2x 01/29/21 $50c</p>\n\n<p>(Somebody on mobile add the rockets pls)</p>\n\n<p>ETA69: Somebody showed me how to do the rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 LFG!!!</p>\n\n<p>ETA420: DON&#39;T GIVE ME GOLD, KEEP THAT MONEY AND FUCKING BUY GME SHARES</p>\n\n<p>ETA from one of the commenters below, <a href=\"/u/theodros1\">u/theodros1</a>:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores. The 1.5 stores will be more &quot;PC oriented&quot; and will allow users to choose parts. He didn&#39;t confirm &quot;PC building stations&quot; but dropped an amazing tidbit. The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.</p>\n\n<p>edit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the &quot;Cohen news hasn&#39;t materialized yet&quot;... I said him being &quot;CEO&quot; and he grunted, I think affirmatively</p>\n\n<p>edit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about &quot;reset&quot; of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5</p>\n\n<p>edit 3: Found a 1.5 station, he confirmed OP&#39;s post. There will be gamestop stores where we can build out our whole PC in store. Didn&#39;t have balls to ask about Cohen as CEO though lol&quot;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/","title":"$GME DD- Build-a-PC Kiosks Coming","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T07:57:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 07:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5a206401-1357-5651-bc07-524af6974f80","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"ethandavid","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ethandavid","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ethandavid","score":1334,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"通用汽车E DD- Build-a-PC Kiosks即将推出。","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：Gamestop在一些商店里实地建立PC建站，买GME的股份。\nROCKETS OUTBOUND\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n今天，我走进Gamestop，打算逛一逛，用25美元的。\n我得到的礼品卡 圣诞节像一年前。I…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"通用汽車E DD- Build-a-PC Kiosks即將推出。","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR：Gamestop在一些商店裏實地建立PC建站，買GME的股份。\nROCKETS OUTBOUND\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n今天，我走進Gamestop，打算逛一逛，用25美元的。\n我得到的禮品卡 聖誕節像一年前。I…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-526fa4ef-3e1c-5f50-bfaf-b6ef893eacfc","excerpt":"U.S. aviation regulators have approved the first fully automated commercial\ndrone flights, fully automated without hands on or direct observation from\nhumans.\n\nThis is a significant and important step in expanding the application of drones\nfor farmers, utilities, mining companies, and many…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kyyx70/industry_to_watch_out_for_2021_drone_technology/","title":"Industry to watch out for 2021 (Drone Technology )","date":"January 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2021年值得关注的行业(无人机技术)","the_new_excerpt":"美国航空监管机构已经批准了第一架全自动商用飞机。\n无人机飞行，完全自动化，不需要动手或直接观察。\n人。\n\n这是扩大无人机应用范围的重要一步。\n为农民、公用事业、矿业公司和许多... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年值得關注的行業(無人機技術)","the_new_excerpt":"美國航空監管機構已經批准了第一架全自動商用飛機。\n無人機飛行，完全自動化，不需要動手或直接觀察。\n人。\n\n這是擴大無人機應用範圍的重要一步。\n爲農民、公用事業、礦業公司和許多... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-0eaf41f5-2c36-5731-8504-583d35e6792c","excerpt":"Alright paper hand fuckers!
