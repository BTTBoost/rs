What things do you weigh most heavily and what sort of things are you looking for? When you are doing due diligence, what metrics are most important to you?</p>\n\n<p>I’m fairly new to investing, and have mainly invested in companies that would be considered household names. These are stocks that a lot of other people have probably done due diligence on and determined that they were safe. Most of my time investigating stocks has been reading articles about other people’s opinions on the stock, and I’ve spent no time at all reading any sort of data out out by the companies, mainly because I don’t know how to read this sort of thing. I realize this isn’t an ideal strategy. If I knew what sort of things to look for, I might be more inclined to do so.
