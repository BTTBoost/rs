In this post I am going to share with you my Due Diligence on the biggest semiconductor foundry in the world, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>[Very Long Post]</strong></p>\n\n<h1>What’s the story of the company?</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/0IJCk3R\">TSM</a> is the biggest chip foundry to provide 7 &amp; 5 nanometer chips that became very popular after Apple moved their chip design in-house. Apple isn’t the only company that works with TSM with other big names like AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Qualcomm and even companies that also build their own chips like INTEL &amp; NXP use TSM do increase their capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Late last year the company also received approval to build a $12B chip plant in Phoenix, which will be a welcomed by the US, as chip demand has far outpaced the supply currently available around the world.</p>\n\n<p>I know it might sound weird, but guys, in my opinion, I believe this $500B <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gMPb0Pb\">company</a> which has risen by more than 150% in the last year after the 2020 lows, still has some room to grow </p>\n\n<h1>Competition &amp; Product</h1>\n\n<p>I believe that TSM has a great advantage compared to companies that operate in their industry, as they have invested huge amounts of money in capital expenditures to gain competitive advantages compared to Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Broadcom &amp; others.</p>\n\n<p>We can also take a look at what Seeking Alpha Quant Factor <a href=\"https://imgur.com/KIQyCtO\">grades</a> the company, and we can see that TSM does pretty good in all 5 categories, Value, Growth, Profitability, Momentum &amp; EPS Revisions.</p>\n\n<p>One other thing we can see here, is that after the huge spike in price, the dividend yield of the company still has room to recover, as the 4-year average yields stands at over 3%, second only to Qualcomm</p>\n\n<h1>MOAT – Easy to replicate? Branding value? Dominance over Marketplace? TAM?</h1>\n\n<p>You are also probably wondering what is the MOAT of the company? Do they have a branding value or some kind of dominance over the Marketplace?</p>\n\n<p>Well, from my point of view, TSM has a significant MOAT against most of its competition as they’ve been able to collect huge amounts of knowledge from its diverse base of over 500 customers which have helped them leap ahead of other companies since the 7NM move in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>TSM pretty much <a href=\"https://imgur.com/l5ekttM\">supplies</a> all the big companies I mentioned earlier which later pass on the technology to their customers, so it’s very likely that you are using one of their chips in some of your devices, maybe your iPhone, your car, computer or anything else.</p>\n\n<p>You can see <a href=\"https://imgur.com/M9MMUfn\">HERE</a>, the MOAT TSM has over Intel, as Intel is still a long way back, working on older generation chips, while TSM is leading the pack.</p>\n\n<p>I believe their market dominance in the 7NM &amp; 5NM chips will continue to keep TSM as the preferred manufactured for most fabless companies just like Apple which currently <a href=\"https://imgur.com/TkAR5kR\">represents</a> over 20% of TSM revenues, it seems to me that TSM is the best foundry to own for the next decade, as the worldwide revenue of semis <a href=\"https://imgur.com/X9iqLlY\">topped</a> $40B to start 2021, with <a href=\"https://imgur.com/3unNxtB\">TSM</a> being the only one of its pears to see a significant growth, with a big chunk of that coming from the huge demand Apple will provide them for the 5NM chips, which accounts for over 50% of their 5NM <a href=\"https://imgur.com/OyfFsEN\">sales</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Friends, this is just my opinion, but I even dare to say that their total addressable market it’s pretty much limitless in the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n<p>Semiconductors are here to stay as technology will only continue to evolve, with smaller &amp; smaller chips in the future and competitors still struggling to catch up with the 5NM technology that TSM already has, so TSM should be poised to remain one of the biggest companies in the world for the foreseeable future</p>\n\n<p>I believe now is the time we need to get to some of the company’s financials &amp; metrics</p>\n\n<h1>Company Growth &amp; Balance Sheet</h1>\n\n<p>Revenue/ Net Income Growth? Profitability?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s start by taking a <a href=\"https://imgur.com/mvUGLnO\">look</a> at how the companies revenues and gross profit have evolved in the past years, and we can see that with the exception of 2018, TSM has seen a continued growth with 2020 being a booming year as gross profit increased by more than 50% with operating income also increasing by more than 60%, which in my eyes is pretty remarkable given the size of the company.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/jHWdJrY\">TSM</a> has managed to post a positive net income in the last 10 years, seeing an increase of over 400% in that same period, so, I hold the opinion that this will continue on the same path for the next 10 years as well </p>\n\n<h1>Cash / Debt / Net Debt &amp; Dilution</h1>\n\n<p>Looking at the balance <a href=\"https://imgur.com/MUCFRtx\">sheet</a> of the company, we also find that TSM has an excellent financial situation, with over $38B in current assets, which can easily pay off the $22B in current liabilities or the $32B in total current &amp; long-term <a href=\"https://imgur.com/kE1mKDV\">liabilities</a>, so the company is way more than solvent.</p>\n\n<h1>Lastest Earnings Reports &amp; Predictions of Revenue Streams / Cost of Sales &amp; Others</h1>\n\n<p>It seems to me that TSM <a href=\"https://imgur.com/mmqloyJ\">posted</a> some terrific numbers yet again in Q4 of 2020, delivering almost $13B in revenues up 22% YoY with 5NM technology already accounting for 20% of wafer revenue as the 5G technology and super-cycle is just starting, with telecom companies struggling to keep up with the increasing demand.</p>\n\n<p>We can see <a href=\"https://imgur.com/ZGM9b2N\">here</a> that the 5NM was already the 2nd biggest revenue stream for the company in the 4th quarter and I would say that it’s pretty likely only going to increase, as this only accounted for 8% of 2020’s <a href=\"https://imgur.com/RJmakFU\">revenues</a>, especially as Smartphone <a href=\"https://imgur.com/B7UHPHO\">account</a> for almost half of TSM revenues from last year, with only the automotive sector seeing a small decline, which was expected, but should recover in the next years, as cars had a bad year given the events of 2020 and they will also very likely contain more &amp; more chips as companies continue to innovate.</p>\n\n<p>TSM also provided a revenue guidance similar to last quarter as gross profit margins are still expected to come in at over 50% </p>\n\n<h1>Dividends?</h1>\n\n<p>One last thing that we should look at before moving on to future projections is how the company is continuing to growth their <a href=\"https://imgur.com/Kxhyy2b\">dividend</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As far as I am concerned, dividend investing is not really my favorite but this is an important thing to look at when looking for companies to buy to maintain a balanced portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>TSM only offers a $1.79 dividend but this has seen a 13.5% growth rate in the past 5 years and given that things are only getting better, I think this can continue as well.</p>\n\n<p>I guess now’s the time to move on to what is the current upside and the long-term potential for TSM</p>\n\n<h1>Current Upside / Long Term Upside?</h1>\n\n<p>First, let’s start with my <a href=\"https://imgur.com/r87yUGF\">expectations</a> of the revenue streams, costs of goods, operating expenses and capital expenditures.</p>\n\n<p>I believe we can continue to see a steady growth in their total sales, that will end up doubling by 2025, reaching over $108B. On the other side, I also believe we can continue to see a gross margin of 54%, similar with what we saw last quarter.</p>\n\n<p>The other operating expenses from R&amp;D and SG&amp;A I pretty much expect to remain the same, as this has been steady over the years, so, a 2.7% of the revenues should go in SG&amp;A and 8.3% should continue to go into continued R&amp;D to keep the companies MOAT.</p>\n\n<p>I would say that TSM is very likely to continue to invest a lot of money in Capex to keep up with the increasing semiconductors demand, so this should continue to grow at around 2.5%/year.</p>\n\n<p>All of these numbers should get us an operating income of almost $27B for 2025, though, there are other things like interest income &amp; expenses that we should account for, but for TSM, this should add up to a slight gain of $400M in 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Finally the effective tax rate of the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/pkOEifS\">company</a>, has stood under 12% for the last 3 years, but, for safety reasons I will imply a small increase each year, which would <a href=\"https://imgur.com/KbtxhZG\">result</a> in TSM having a net income of just over $24B in 2025, paying out a dividend of $3.24, while also not diluting their shares, as TSM hasn’t <a href=\"https://imgur.com/oflEVtF\">diluted</a> their stock significantly since 2005.</p>\n\n<h1>Price to Earnings (PE) Valuation</h1>\n\n<p>PE Valuations are my favorite way to quickly &amp; pretty accurately determine reasonable future prices for stocks. </p>\n\n<p>Taking into account all the numbers we went through earlier, my <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gwgvpXI\">view</a> is that we can see TSM trading anywhere between a 25 and a 40 PE by 2025, which given the $4.64 EPS for 2025 would mean the stock can trade between $116 and $185, but, before moving on to the final price targets let’s also take a quick look at TSM discounted free cash flow valuation.</p>\n\n<h1>DCF</h1>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://imgur.com/hNWP9E2\">implied</a> the same growth rate for TSM revenues and actually lowered their EBIT as a % of their revenues each year by .5%, and after taking into account their effective tax rate, their D&amp;A, capital expenditures and net working capital I arrived at a $71.5B free cash flow by 2025.</p>\n\n<p>As always I also added their net assets and used a 3% long-term growth rate just to be conservative and for the perpetuity approach we got a price target of $86, meaning the company is potentially overvalued at the moment, though, on the other hand, the EBITDA approach, using a 20x multiplier, would results in a price target of $178. </p>\n\n<p>I like to use an average approach of this numbers, which would results in a price target of $132, or a 21% upside in the next 12 months for the company, not including any additional dividends received.</p>\n\n<h1>Technical Chart</h1>\n\n<p>Looking at a short-term <a href=\"https://imgur.com/qgvPpXM\">chart</a>, we find that TSM is pretty underbought right now with an RSI of 36, but the volumes in the stock are slightly increasing.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the next support level for TSM stands at $103 while the next resistance is just above my 12-month price target for the company, as TSM had a fake breakout over $135 in the middle of last month.</p>\n\n<h1>Wall St. Opinion</h1>\n\n<p>I always take a look after I’ve finished my DD to what analysts say, and in this case, they have a $137 PT for the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/xAVfqN4\">company</a> slightly higher than my own DD, so it seems I was pretty accurate with my expectations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/l6EndWo\">Analysts</a> also expect a 72B on average, while my estimates are the top end of their range, but on the other hand, I only have an EPS of 4.64$ in 2025, compared to $5.6 expected by them by 2023.</p>\n\n<h1>Weaknesses</h1>\n\n<p>When looking at what companies you should invest in, it’s recommended to also take into account their potential weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p>I have no doubt that TSM does have some weaknesses, but probably the biggest one is that they really so much on their Apple revenues, though, it’s hard to believe Apple will move away from TSM anytime soon, or even if that happens that TSM won’t find other customers in need of their products in a short period of time, especially now with the huge worldwide chip shortage.</p>\n\n<p>While writing this post, we also received <a href=\"https://imgur.com/MCjAWXZ\">news</a> from INTEL that they are planning on building 2 new foundries in Arizona. This might provide even more pressure on the current price of TSM, but, in my humble opinion, i think this just more buzz, with Intel still laggining behind in technology, not even having the 7NM available, while TSM is already working on 2 &amp; 3NM developments. So, i&#39;d take this as another opportunity to &quot;buy the dip&quot;</p>\n\n<h1>Short Selling? Institutional Holding?</h1>\n\n<p>The company has such a solid future that the percentage of <a href=\"https://imgur.com/wl06zGs\">shares</a> sold on the short side is under .3%, which is one of the lowest I have ever seen in a company.</p>\n\n<p>Though, on the other hand, the stock isn’t that largely <a href=\"https://imgur.com/ndoKXcs\">owned</a> by institutions, with JP Morgan leading the pack with under 1%, buy, my guess is that’s because this isn’t a US based company, which does make it less attractive to big investment banks &amp; funds.</p>\n\n<p>I bet that you are just waiting to see the final price targets and my final opinion, so let’s jump to that right now</p>\n\n<h1>Final Opinion &amp; Prediction!</h1>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://imgur.com/P7OQKtb\">opinion</a>, TSM is a must have stock in most portfolios, brining some balance, with good growth ahead of it. TSM might helped lower the beta of most portfolios that are way to heavy on the overhyped tech stocks right now.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, this is just my humble opinion as a retail investor, this is not an investment advice, but my view is that we can see TSM moving towards the $132 range by early next year, with TSM likely to be jump-started again around their next <a href=\"https://imgur.com/ClXzJZG\">earnings</a> report in April </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the long-term <a href=\"https://imgur.com/dgQTLy7\">view</a>, my base TSM target is $150 by 2025, meaning an ROI of 38% which is not that great, but when taking into account the expected dividends received from TSM, that can jump to over 50% </p>\n\n<p>Speaking personally, my 2025 Price <a href=\"https://imgur.com/9ZWdcb5\">Targets</a> for TSM range from an average of the 25 &amp; 30 PE multiple, my base case from the 30 &amp; 35, while my bull case averages de 35 &amp; 40 PE multiple prices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you everyone for reading🙏 Hope you enjoyed the content!
