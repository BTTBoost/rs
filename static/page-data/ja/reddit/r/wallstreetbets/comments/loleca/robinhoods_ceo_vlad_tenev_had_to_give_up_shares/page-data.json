The investors will get that equity at a discounted valuation tied to the price of Robinhood shares when the company goes public, two of the people said. Robinhood plans to hold an initial public offering this year. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Less GME buying means the price drops which precipitates a sell-off. A sell-off means lower capital requirements which means Tenev doesn&#39;t have to sell as many shares. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Robin Hood&quot; screwed us and stole our money to protect his own wealth. I hope these lawsuits are successful. </p>\n\n<p>Buy puts on Robinhood.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loleca/robinhoods_ceo_vlad_tenev_had_to_give_up_shares/","title":"Robinhood's CEO, Vlad Tenev, had to give up shares of Robinhood in order to meet capital requirements","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T08:45:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 08:45","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d546d1a7-c812-5efa-b5c5-75015ad28178","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loleca/robinhoods_ceo_vlad_tenev_had_to_give_up_shares/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loleca/robinhoods_ceo_vlad_tenev_had_to_give_up_shares/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/7erpdH6ysr_d8jeUzopOucBh_scqi-ABOXk1r-Qk3Pc.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a50bc7b350a8aee0ea601fab8948df3e76ca134b","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"moltch","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/moltch","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"moltch","score":6817,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Robinhood的CEO Vlad Tenev为了满足资本要求，不得不放弃Robinhood的股份。","the_new_excerpt":"我想确保每个人都在这个subreddit了解为什么Robinhood想要。\n杀死GME。\n\n从这个纽约时报的文章\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html]。\n\n> 向Robinhood提供新融资的投资者将获得额外的融资。\n>公司的股权。该...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood的CEO Vlad Tenev爲了滿足資本要求，不得不放棄Robinhood的股份。","the_new_excerpt":"我想確保每個人都在這個subreddit瞭解爲什麼Robinhood想要。\n殺死GME。\n\n從這個紐約時報的文章\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html]。\n\n> 向Robinhood提供新融資的投資者將獲得額外的融資。\n>公司的股權。該...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-236f2cb2-895b-5c47-832e-b3a1dbf799c2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/logd9i/round_2_the_deep_fucking_finale/","title":"Round 2 - The Deep Fucking Finale 🚀🚀🚀🚀","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-8fbcd5f2-8d56-5a10-b0b6-4a947ebb4f65","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lonpp9/whos_ready_for_gme_round_2/","title":"Who's ready for GME round 2?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 21, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"谁准备好参加GME第二轮比赛了？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰準備好參加GME第二輪比賽了？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-d546d1a7-c812-5efa-b5c5-75015ad28178","previousId":"RedditPost-236f2cb2-895b-5c47-832e-b3a1dbf799c2","nextId":"RedditPost-8fbcd5f2-8d56-5a10-b0b6-4a947ebb4f65","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loleca/robinhoods_ceo_vlad_tenev_had_to_give_up_shares/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
