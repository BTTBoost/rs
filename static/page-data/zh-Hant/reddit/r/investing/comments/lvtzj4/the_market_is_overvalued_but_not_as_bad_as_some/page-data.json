If we map PE10 below on a graph you can see the historic trend.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3\">https://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Are we about to have another Great Depression?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Probably not.</p>\n\n<p>We can see strong multiple growth since the 80s, which if we believe is representative of the new norm and will continue, suggests that we&#39;re actually not drastically far off the trend. Mapping trends during a peak is risky, this graph would look a lot different after a major correction.</p>\n\n<p>In general we&#39;re still a ways off the insanity of the dotcom boom. With only good news coming out short term with stimulus and countries opening back up post covid I don&#39;t see a crash soon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you time the market to buy low sell high?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/DksC60V\">https://imgur.com/a/DksC60V</a></p>\n\n<p>Not easily.</p>\n\n<p>The above graph (orange line) represents selling stocks when PE multiples are 3 above the trend and buying back in when PE multiples are below 3. You can see you massively underperform, that&#39;s before we even count missed dividends. You can find very specific numbers that give you a greater return, but they only work on one specific crash and ofter have you sitting out huge periods that&#39;d cost too much in lost dividends.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s possible to reduce losses during downturns through adjustments, but it&#39;s not as easy as looking at one number.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","title":"The market is overvalued but not as bad as some say","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T23:48:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 23:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"462640ac-a23a-57d5-b19d-b6e282830748","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ini0n","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ini0n","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ini0n","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"市场被高估了，但并不像有些人说的那么糟糕。","the_new_excerpt":"这里有很多关于PE比率和大萧条水平的讨论。\n的高估。如果我们把下面的PE10绘制成图，就可以看到历史趋势。\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3\n\n我们是不是要再来一次大萧条？\n\n也许不会。\n\n我们可以看到80年代以来强劲的倍数增长，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"市場被高估了，但並不像有些人說的那麼糟糕。","the_new_excerpt":"這裏有很多關於PE比率和大蕭條水平的討論。\n的高估。如果我們把下面的PE10繪製成圖，就可以看到歷史趨勢。\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kgaQCY3\n\n我們是不是要再來一次大蕭條？\n\n也許不會。\n\n我們可以看到80年代以來強勁的倍數增長，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6ea3a93b-4c2e-51cf-b850-6421c07a8585","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwap9f/hold/","title":"HOLD","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"保持","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"保持","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-91bd8a49-8710-5d71-8d29-8564be3fe0ab","excerpt":"If somehow you don't know what Barrick is (NYSE:GOLD, TSX:ABX) it's a mining\ncompany based in Toronto, specializing in gold, duh.\n\nobjective stats:\n\nMarket cap: ~42BlnCAD\n\nCurrent trade volume is >5mil\n\nIndustry P/E last year: ~35\n\nABX current P/E: ~14.5\n\nThey are LOSING market share: Precious…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lw55o0/barrick_gold_is_near_its_52_week_low/","title":"Barrick Gold is near it's 52 week low","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"巴里克黄金接近52周低点","the_new_excerpt":"如果你不知道巴里克是什么(NYSE:GOLD, TSX:ABX)，它是一家矿业公司。\n公司总部在多伦多，专门做黄金，杜。\n\n客观统计。\n\n市值： ~420亿加元\n\n目前的贸易量大于500万\n\n去年行业市盈率。~35\n\nABX当前市盈率：~14.5\n\n他们正在失去市场份额。贵重的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"巴里克黃金接近52周低點","the_new_excerpt":"如果你不知道巴里克是什麼(NYSE:GOLD, TSX:ABX)，它是一家礦業公司。\n公司總部在多倫多，專門做黃金，杜。\n\n客觀統計。\n\n市值： ~420億加元\n\n目前的貿易量大於500萬\n\n去年行業市盈率。~35\n\nABX當前市盈率：~14.5\n\n他們正在失去市場份額。貴重的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-462640ac-a23a-57d5-b19d-b6e282830748","previousId":"RedditPost-6ea3a93b-4c2e-51cf-b850-6421c07a8585","nextId":"RedditPost-91bd8a49-8710-5d71-8d29-8564be3fe0ab","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvtzj4/the_market_is_overvalued_but_not_as_bad_as_some/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
