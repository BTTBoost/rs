First and foremost I&#39;m hoping everyone is safe and sound during this time. </p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the world of trading. I will make this post very simple and straight to the point because newcomers that I am aware of are making me CRINGE by the way they speak and are investing into stocks, not only in this sub, but including people I personally know. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>DO NOT spill your life savings into trading.\n You have worked very hard to make that money. The last thing you need is all that money disapearing in a blink of an eye. Start off with an amount you can truly play around with - and do not jump into the get rich quick scheme by dumping everything. Even if it&#39;s just $100.00, it&#39;s a great amount to get a feel for the market. </p></li>\n<li><p>DD - Due Dilligence \n  This means to investigate on a particular stock you are interested in investing. How so? View their accessible financial records, see how they have performed in the previous years, what situation they are in, etc; That doesn&#39;t mean, &quot;Oh, someone told me Daddy Tesla tweeted about a Woof Woof currency so I&#39;m going to dump my money there.&quot;\nOr another example is with people claiming that a certain stock will jump extremely high so &quot;get in right now!!! 🚀.&quot;\nNO. Just no.\nI am not saying ALL those individuals are ill-minded or trying to get you, but if you come across something like this, then research &quot;Pumping and Dumping&quot;. (Quick Answer.\nPlease, do your own research. I understand everyone wants to make money, especially during this horrific time, but you must do your own part as a trader and not rely or leech of others. Be Smart.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Set a target price and limit for a stock and don&#39;t be GREEDY.\n As you see the stock you have invested in is slowly increasing in value, your mouth will get watery. Pretty soon it will get to the point where it gets so high that in an instant it can DROP, causing water to now come out of your eyes. \nI know we want more and more, but especially if you&#39;re trading for short term, set a price you would want to sell at. Example:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>BAD:\nLet us purchase this stock at $0.25, we shall sell at $0.30. Oh wow it&#39;s at $0.30, okay let&#39;s sell at $0.32, it will surely hit. Ah shit, it hit $0.23 , we have to sell this just so it doesn&#39;t go lower.</p>\n\n<p>Set a limit order ! This will automatically sell at the target price you want it to. Once you get your profits, take off and don&#39;t look back saying you wish you invested much more and longer if the stock value decides to increase. Be happy! A profit is better than no profit and/or losses!  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Educate yourself\n Read up on stocks ! How they work, the meaning of stocks, puts, NASDAQ, ETF&#39;s, etc; Familiarize yourself with trading terms. Watch YouTube videos on how to get comfortable with the market, beginner videos on trading, live trading with professionals, etc; Feed yourself knowledge. The more educated you get, the more serene your experience will be within the market.\n&quot;Any fool can know. The point is to understand.&quot; ~ Albert Einstein.</p></li>\n<li><p>Handling losses. \n If you are losing a substantial amount of money from what you have deposited and it is affecting you mentally, physically or is causing you to be in a depressive state you can&#39;t escape, then you shouldn&#39;t be trading anymore. You have to learn to handle losses. Every trader goes through a loss or failure as so does every human being excluding trading.  It was your idea to get into trading, so you should be aware of risk consequences.\nLearn to enjoy the whole journey man regardless of what happens. Have fun every step of the way and don&#39;t let certain things get to you. I&#39;ve had my losses in the market and I am glad to say it hasn&#39;t bothered me one bit. Life is meant to be enjoyed, not to be lived with sadness. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Best of luck to all of us traders and I wish you nothing but success for this brand new year and the years to come. Please feel free to post other pieces of advice as I am fairly new to the stock market as well (been roughly a year). Thanks for reading.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lfvveo/advice_for_new_serious_traders/","title":"Advice for NEW SERIOUS TRADERS","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T07:23:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 07:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"212789e3-3fee-5df2-ab6a-7ed8711f6cd8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfvveo/advice_for_new_serious_traders/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lfvveo/advice_for_new_serious_traders/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"mvlli","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mvlli","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mvlli","score":1433,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"给新交易者的建议","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，你们好 首先，最重要的是，我希望每个人都平安无事，在这段时间里。\n时间。\n\n欢迎来到交易的世界。我将使这篇文章非常简单和直接\n因为我所知道的新人都让我CRINGE了。\n他们说话的方式，而且是投资股票，不仅...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"給新交易者的建議","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，你們好 首先，最重要的是，我希望每個人都平安無事，在這段時間裏。\n時間。\n\n歡迎來到交易的世界。我將使這篇文章非常簡單和直接\n因爲我所知道的新人都讓我CRINGE了。\n他們說話的方式，而且是投資股票，不僅...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-552aeff5-a466-5268-a3f9-fa3442098273","excerpt":"Retards, listen up.\n\nSo a while back I YOLOed my entire account on calls and lost it all in 4 minutes\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/].\nLike a sensible \"investor\" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right?
