However, an important thing to note is that the Chinese are not only getting richer but the Chinese middle class seems to continue to grow which is the more important number (<a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/jack-ma-makes-rare-visit-123439015.html\">Yahoo!Finance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/january/income-living-standards-china#:%7E:text=However%2C%20since%20the%20measure%20is%20based%20on%20the,median%20income%20but%20far%20below%20the%20world%20average\">St. Louis Fed</a>)<em><sup>Important because this directly impacts the market that the company is in</sup></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>\n\n<p>Slower growth metrics and loss of market share from companies such as Pinduoduo and JD.com</p>\n\n<p>Dark clouds of the antitrust regulations and potential future regulatory concerns</p>\n\n<p>Tensions between US and China relationships may serve as risky for Chinese companies/holdings in the United States.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note on investing in China</strong></p>\n\n<p>A common point that I see on Alibaba or any Chinese ADR is that China can nullify any value of what you own at any moment simply because they don&#39;t like a company. While there are some elements of truth to this, intuitively speaking, this wouldn&#39;t make sense for China to do since they&#39;re trying to welcome MORE foreign investment.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there are many mutual funds, ETFs, and individuals that have exposure to China than before as referenced by the Alipay and Yahoo scandal (<a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-alibaba-softbank-reach-agreement-alipay-160402485.html\">Source</a>) which would be counterproductive to the point above.</p>\n\n<p>To cut the knees of their technology companies even further as they&#39;re positioning themselves to be competitive to the United States wouldn&#39;t make sense. A recent notable event was the introduction of the digital Yuan for Alipay which indicates Alibaba is aligned with CCP values and will continue to show their willingness to work with them (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/china-digital-yuan-alibabas-ant-joins-e-cny-currency-trial.html\">Source</a>)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Alibaba seems to have put the antitrust issues behind them with the Alibaba&#39;s growth is slowing as indicated by analyst reported estimates and current earnings. Although this may seem alarming, Alibaba is continuously reinvesting into growth opportunities which can hurt their short term bottom line. The growing Chinese middle class and disposable income per capita points to more good signs than bad for Alibaba. The middle class and income numbers are far more important than overall population numbers. Regulatory concerns aren&#39;t over for Alibaba in its entirety but the business is very solid and they&#39;ve shown a willingness to comply with any new introduction to Chinese regulatory policy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> In a land of unattractive valuations in the current stock market environment, Alibaba with a forward P/E of ~20 seems extremely attractive for a long term investment despite short term volatility.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/nblr1d/baba_analysis_for_alibaba_after_earnings/","title":"$BABA - Analysis for Alibaba after Earnings","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-14T01:13:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-14 01:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2995e18a-90e5-5789-966c-fddc86dc0ee2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nblr1d/baba_analysis_for_alibaba_after_earnings/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nblr1d/baba_analysis_for_alibaba_after_earnings/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"misteralternate2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/misteralternate2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"misteralternate2","score":106,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$BABA - 決算後のアリババの分析","the_new_excerpt":"2021年05月13日時点での最新の収益（CNBC\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/13/alibaba-earnings-q4-net-loss-after-2point8-billion-antitrust-fine.html]):価格\n投稿時の価格：206.89ドル\n\n売上高 売上高：1,873億9,000万ドル（286億ドル） vs. 1,801億1,000万ドル（279億6,000万ドル）億元\n予想、前年同期比64％増...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"$BABA - 阿里巴巴盈利后的分析","the_new_excerpt":"截至2021年5月13日的最新财报 (CNBC)\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/13/alibaba-earnings-q4-net-loss-after-2point8-billion-antitrust-fine.html]）：价格\n发布时的价格：206.89美元\n\n收入。1,873.9亿元（286亿美元），与1,804.1（279.6亿美元）亿元相比\n预计，同比增长64%...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BABA - 阿里巴巴盈利後的分析","the_new_excerpt":"截至2021年5月13日的最新財報 (CNBC)\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/13/alibaba-earnings-q4-net-loss-after-2point8-billion-antitrust-fine.html]）：價格\n發佈時的價格：206.89美元\n\n收入。1,873.9億元（286億美元），與1,804.1（279.6億美元）億元相比\n預計，同比增長64%...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0293282c-a675-5855-a863-4942dcdf9d95","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nboe4x/i_too_yolod_my_retirement_account_into_gme_when_i/","title":"I, too, YOLO'D my retirement account into GME when I switched jobs.
