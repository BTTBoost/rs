The new Hyundai Ioniq 5 is equipped with the technology, and Tesla has commented that all future vehicles will be equipped with bidirectional charging capacity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation of Handelsblatt excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The test vehicles are running, we are in the last pulls with the preparations,” confirms VW Development Board Member Thomas Ulbrich in an interview with the Handelsblatt. From 2022 onwards, <strong>every electric car from the Volkswagen Group that is developed on the basis of the MEB</strong> (“modular electrification kit”) electrical platform can not only charge the electricity but also return it to the grid. In addition to VW, the MEB is also used by the sister brands Audi , Skoda and Seat-Cupra.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Commentary elsewhere:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/\">https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Carmakers that dive into the business of smoothing the grid would benefit more than financially, also. By saving unused renewable energy for future use to feed into the power grid, the vehicle industry would also acquire knowledge of how much storage capacity would actually be available at certain times.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For the Volkswagen group, it will also set it apart from Tesla, which is more focused on having its cars on the road in service as autonomous taxis.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mm2cpo/handelsblatt_vw_will_switch_to_massproducing/","title":"Handelsblatt: VW will switch to mass-producing electric vehicles with bidirectional charging next year (VOW, VWAGY)","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"April 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-07T21:55:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-07 21:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a707aba9-271e-5733-8021-27cdf80a74fa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mm2cpo/handelsblatt_vw_will_switch_to_massproducing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mm2cpo/handelsblatt_vw_will_switch_to_massproducing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Torlek1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Torlek1","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Torlek1","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ハンデルスブラット VWは来年、双方向充電の電気自動車の量産に切り替える (VOW, VWAGY)","the_new_excerpt":"VW、双方向充電の電気自動車の量産に切り替える\n来年\n[https://electrek.co/2021/04/06/vw-electric-vehicles-bi-directional-charging-next-year/]\n\nV2Gの背景を抜粋しました。\n\n> この技術は、しばしば \"Vehicle-to-grid \"と呼ばれています。\n> \n> 電気自動車に...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Handelsblatt。大众将于明年转产双向充电的电动汽车（VOW，VWAGY）。","the_new_excerpt":"大众将转为量产电动汽车，并配备双向充电功能。\n明年\n[https://electrek.co/2021/04/06/vw-electric-vehicles-bi-directional-charging-next-year/]\n\nV2G的背景节选。\n\n> 该技术通常被称为 \"车辆到电网\"。\n> \n> 电动汽车与...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Handelsblatt。大衆將於明年轉產雙向充電的電動汽車（VOW，VWAGY）。","the_new_excerpt":"大衆將轉爲量產電動汽車，並配備雙向充電功能。\n明年\n[https://electrek.co/2021/04/06/vw-electric-vehicles-bi-directional-charging-next-year/]\n\nV2G的背景節選。\n\n> 該技術通常被稱爲 \"車輛到電網\"。\n> \n> 電動汽車與...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-02dfb97b-b7c3-50c1-8f64-8d2c20506f70","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mm6n82/proof_my_700_gme_shares_balls_deep_lets_take_gme/","title":"Proof my 700 GME shares, balls deep!!
