We know this because the now legendary Hololens 2 tear down by <a href=\"/u/S2upid\">u/S2upid</a>: <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/S2upidHololens2Teardown\">https://tinyurl.com/S2upidHololens2Teardown</a></p>\n\n<p>This is why MVIS spiked 50% following the news.</p>\n\n<p>Full article: <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html\">www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html</a></p>\n\n<p>This deal will surely lead to an significant increase in MicroVision’s AR vertical revenue, however, the military contract is just the tip of the iceberg...</p>\n\n<p>The big PR that everyone has been waiting for has yet to drop... MicroVision has best-in-class 4D LiDAR for with technical specs and price per unit meeting or exceeding OEM autonomous driving requirements.\nThe company has announced at the last EC that the LiDAR A-Sample will be complete in April 21, and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions... there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired\">www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired</a></p>\n\n<p>Let’s connect some dots...</p>\n\n<p>Summary of the recent compelling events:</p>\n\n<p>Note: Some of the below DD based on summary from <a href=\"/u/t-jameson-corazon\">u/t-jameson-corazon</a> </p>\n\n<p>Feb, 2020 - CEO Sumit Sharma takes the reins. Sumit used to be Director of Google Glass. </p>\n\n<p>June, 2020 - Dr Mark Spitzer joins the BoD. Spitzer has ties to Google.  Dr Spitzer is the leading AR expert in the world and came out of retirement to be a part of MicroVision’s journey.</p>\n\n<p>Q3 2020 - Ford announced a stake in Velodyne (VLDR), a competitor in automotive LiDAR.</p>\n\n<p>Dec, 2020 - Judy Curran (Ford) joins the Microvision BoD.</p>\n\n<p>Judy Curran previously held executive positions at Ford Motor Co. She has more than 30 years of experience in vehicle program, engineering, and technology leadership. Curran currently serves as Head of Global Automotive Strategy at ANSYS, a developer of multiphysics engineering simulation software. ANSYS could conduct testing for interested parties to have benchmark data.</p>\n\n<p>Ford and Google have a strategic partnership.</p>\n\n<p>2/1/21 - State of Michigan has purchased 1 Million shares of MVIS (not $1 million worth of MVIS, 1 Million SHARES).</p>\n\n<p>Ford is based in Michigan.</p>\n\n<p>2/5/21 - Blackrock buys 2.4 million SHARES.</p>\n\n<p>Mid-Feb 21 - Ford sold its position in VLDR.</p>\n\n<p>Feb 16th 21, MVIS announces a $50M ATM offering agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. This ATM gave MicroVision the Net Working Capital (NWC) needed to facilitate a Merger and Acquision. This was filed with the SEC in a way that allows MVIS to pay fees based on the current share price and not disclose the future share price (Sign of incoming buyout).</p>\n\n<p>March 2nd, 21’ - BoD Bernee D. L. Strom steps down to make room for the newest board member, Seval Oz.</p>\n\n<p>Seval Oz, the newest BoD, is a recognized global business and marketing leader in mobility, autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transportation systems. </p>\n\n<p>Oz was a Founder and CEO of Aurima, Inc, a multi-sensor awareness platform powered by AI deep learning for autonomous vehicles. She was previously CEO of Continental Intelligent Transportation Systems, a division of Continental AG Interiors Division. She has served as Head of Global Strategic Partnerships for Google[x]&#39;s Self Driving Cars Program (Waymo) where she supported global business and marketing efforts for Google’s self-driving technology commercial launch. In addition, she is an executive board advisor to automotive industry leaders and an investment advisor to several investment funds and holds 10 patents in vehicular technology software.  </p>\n\n<p>Seval Oz - “I am thrilled to join the MicroVision board of directors at this opportune time. I am excited to bring my expertise and experience in autonomous vehicle technology and mobility to the Company as it develops its automotive LiDAR technology and explores strategic alternatives.”</p>\n\n<p>Seval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC yet. The only logical reason for her not doing so is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). This is BAFF (Bullish as Fucking Fuck).</p>\n\n<p>Several BoD’s have stepped down in recent months (to make room for the new appointees) and have not sold their stock.</p>\n\n<p>Sumit has repeatedly stated he is interested in exploring strategic alternatives including the sale of a vertical or multiple verticals.  </p>\n\n<p>Sumit has repeatedly said he wants to get fair market value for the shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>“⁠Best in class LiDAR” - Sumit during EC.</p>\n\n<p>“There is no competition in any verticals” - Sumit.</p>\n\n<p>Sumit has staked his and MicroVision’s entire reputation on the April LiDAR A-Sample.</p>\n\n<p>Sumit can’t contain himself on the EC and references the internet boom as a simile for his excitement.</p>\n\n<p>When asked about the LiDAR competition on the EC, Sumit chuckles and says, “There is no competition.”</p>\n\n<p>No fireside chat after Q4 2020 earnings call (They typically have had these but it seems they are trying to say as little as possible, a sign of a buyout being negotiated).</p>\n\n<p>David Allen/Investor Relations, has not been able to answer most questions over email or the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Yalon Farhi - BoD who’s funds kept MVIS alive steps down and retires.</p>\n\n<p>Yalon Farhi hasn’t sold.</p>\n\n<p>David Westgor stepping down as VP General Counsel. He is staying on in a consulting role until June.</p>\n\n<p>From the Press Release: “I will be stepping back from my current role but will continue to provide support to the Company on a consulting basis through June as the Company transitions to a new general counsel.” (Presumably the new general counsel from the acquiring company - This is BAFF).</p>\n\n<p>(See #8)  - <a href=\"http://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired\">www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired</a></p>\n\n<p>David Westgor hasn’t sold.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Holt (STEVE HOLT!!!)/CFO, exercised his options to buy shares at $17/share a few weeks ago... very interesting that he would choose that time to exercise them... This is BAFF.</p>\n\n<p>Seval Oz still hasn’t filed a Form 3 or 4.</p>\n\n<p>⁠Ever growing new jobs listing.</p>\n\n<p>MicroVision is not attending CES (Worlds largest AR/MR/VR conference) hololens is the best selling AR in the world.</p>\n\n<p>LIDAR A-sample reveal in April (April is here) <a href=\"https://www.mviscountdown.com/\">https://www.mviscountdown.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Chris Grayson thinks Niatech (Google owned) has “a confident guess” that they will be using MicroVision light engines.</p>\n\n<p>3/30/21 - MicroVision follows Elon on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed Government infrastructure bill is good for EV and autonomous driving growth tech.</p>\n\n<p>Naked shorts and MM’s are driving the pps down.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody is defending the price.</p>\n\n<p>Not even counting patent filings for lasers and scanning devices from MANY interested parties ranging from US to a GLOBAL scale.</p>\n\n<p>We know there is significant short interest against MVIS, in fact several short firms have been very vocal about being short on MVIS. Based purely on the P/E ratio, it would seem that shorting would be a good strategy, however, MVIS value is not in the current earnings, it is in the IP of the LiDAR and AR tech.</p>\n\n<p>From a TA perspective, we are seeing bullish divergence on the weekly chart. We are making higher lows on the weekly and lower lows on the RSI. This is bullish divergence and a sign that another breakout is coming soon... Also, the shorts will be forced to cover soon, which will cause a short squeeze. Wait until the A-Sample PR drops... let alone the buyout PR...</p>\n\n<p>Tesla crashing causing increase in liability and eyes pushing for regulation.</p>\n\n<p>Samuel Kang, head of total solutions North America for BYD says last week, “we believe in mvis” and comments after, “they have better tech then Luminar.”</p>\n\n<p>MVIS is considered a Mid-Cap stock since its market cap is over $2B. This has let to a further increase in institutional ownership.</p>\n\n<p>Russell indices reconstitution coming up in May. Today MVIS isn&#39;t in any Russell indices since it was below the min $1/share cutoff last year. This year, MVIS should land in several.</p>\n\n<p>More and MORE FUD across all platforms. The only real argument is that we don’t have a working product that anyone has seen and very little revenue.</p>\n\n<p>That’s about to change...</p>\n\n<p>Luminar (LAZR) LiDAR is currently valued at $8B, they were $10B prior to the tech correction, and MVIS LiDAR is superior in terms is specs, size, and scalability. Therefore, we can estimate the fair market value of MVIS auto LiDAR vertical being at least equivalent to LAZR at $8-10B ($51-$63.50/share). I personally think MVIS LiDAR should garner more since it is superior to LAZR, so I am estimating $75-100 pps for the Auto LiDAR vertical. That is not even mentioning the value of the Consumer LiDAR and AR verticals. MVIS has a portfolio of over 460 patents. My price target for the entire company is at least $150/share.</p>\n\n<p>AEVA is the new kid on the block, recently went public via SPAC. Founded by ex-Apple guys, so they have generated some buzz snd have a current market cap of $2.6B. AEVA also has 4D LiDAR, their tech is based on a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system that integrates onto a chip. Our key advantage over AEVA is timing and speed to market. AEVA has announced they will not be ready for production until late 2023/early 2024. MVIS has comparable if not superior technical specs and has a 3 year head start on AEVA... 3 years...</p>\n\n<p>MicroVision regarding their LiDAR:\n“We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have a range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any LiDAR with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters, and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This equates to 520 points per square degree.”</p>\n\n<p>If you want a deep dive, here is a comprehensive breakdown of the entire investment thesis and proof of MicroVision’s superiority in LiDAR and AR provided by <a href=\"/u/BigBlackWifey\">u/BigBlackWifey</a>: <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2y26hsxh\">https://tinyurl.com/2y26hsxh</a>\nHighly Recommend!</p>\n\n<p>Link to <a

calls/LEAPS.</p>\n\n<p>This is a YOLO for me as I have 95% of my folio in MVIS.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t want to regret not buying more pre-buyout.</p>\n\n<p>This is the way.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON
