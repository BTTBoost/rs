&lt;p&gt;Considering my day job is all about technology the companies I know best are tech. I first purchased 5 shares of Nvidia in 2016 because they simply made superior graphic cards. Then crypto and Tesla autonomy and ARM really put the boosters on! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the risk to Coinbase is reliance on fees, as the industry will find more and more ways to offer trading more cheaply, or commission free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the good news. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Q3 2020, there was low Crypto volitily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means commissions income was down 44%. Q-on-Q.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Q3 21, Y-on-Y, commissions income is up 290% from Q3 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although subscriptions/fees are only, currently, like 10%, of Coinbases revenue stream -- they&amp;#39;ve grown that revenue stream by 41% from last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of COIN is highly correlated to the price of crypto assets rising and failing..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.. it&amp;#39;s recent rise in price has been due to the the current rise in vaule in crypto assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gap will fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be it one month or one quarter, or 2 years, barring a market crash, I think it will fill. This sell off is dumb, short sided, and backwards, not forward looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dip worth holding and buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COIN success included recently adding more coins to compete with competitors, 24/7 phone support coming next quarter, Coin Prime &amp;amp; Coin Cloud, services recently added, to my understanding, to sell crypto to institutions (think NBA and FB deal,) and also to allow websites to accept direct payment IN crypto (Coin Cloud.) That move will continue to help Crypto become more and more mainstream, which stands to benefit Coin more than the average competitor due to their Mainstream UI/branding and first mover market share domance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own some COIN stock.
This is my opinion.
It&amp;#39;s not investment advice. Don&amp;#39;t buy or sell things because of what people on the internet say.
I hope to provoke conversation. To have my assumptions challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical analysis (TA)&lt;/strong&gt; uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

“Usu­ally when ex­ec­u­tives an­nounce they are sell­ing stock af­ter a sharp run-up in the price, it is ob­vi­ous to every­one that they think the share price is too high. Mr. Musk seems to have dreamed up a cun­ning plan to try to get round this prob­lem. In­stead of an­nounc­ing he was sell­ing stock, he noted the plan by Sen. Ron Wyden to tax un­re­al­ized cap­i­tal gains, and held a Twit­ter poll on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla hold­ing. When the Twit­terati duly voted for him to dump shares in the elec­tric-car maker, that con­fused the ques­tion of whether this is an in­sider sig­nal about the share price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per­haps Mr. Musk thinks that it’s in­sane that Tesla added $440 bil­lion to its value in the past month alone, a rise—just the rise, not the to­tal—equiv­a­lent to the com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­iza­tion of Ford, Gen­eral Mo­tors and Toy­ota.
…
Tesla sits at the in­ter­sec­tion of three strong trends, and a change in any one of them could lead to a rapid fall back in the stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first are meme stocks. Tesla is the orig­i­nal meme stock, sup­ported by in­di­vid­u­als who’ve done very well by fol­low­ing Mr. Musk, and who don’t take kindly to any­one who dis­agrees. No mat­ter the re­al­ity of sales, com­pe­ti­tion, mar­gins, sub­si­dies or any­thing else, Mr. Musk has at­tracted sup­port­ers who not only buy, but ac­tively pro­mote Tesla shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sec­ond is the will­ing­ness of in­vestors to bet on the far dis­tant fu­ture. Tesla doesn’t make very much money, or in­deed very many cars, at the mo­ment. It is val­ued at $1.3 mil­lion for each of the 900,000 or so cars it is fore­cast to de­liver this year be­cause of the po­ten­tial for growth. The value of the com­pany doesn’t lie in this year or next year’s sales, but on hopes for sales and prof­its far in the fu­ture…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third sup­port­ive trend is the de­sire for green tech­nol­ogy. It’s great to be an elec­tric-car maker at the mo­ment. Gov­ern­ments are push­ing elec­tric cars and the rest of the in­dus­try is stuck with the wrong sort of fac­to­ries, has the wrong sort of re­search ex­per­tise and hasn’t yet built ve­hi­cle-charg­ing net­works. Tesla is on the right side of gov­ern­ments and in­vestors pledg­ing ac­tion to re­duce car­bon emis­sions. Yet, if the share price change was about Tesla beat­ing the gaso­line-fu­eled com­pe­ti­tion, the shares of tra­di­tional ri­vals should be suf­fer­ing. In­stead, the value of the other car mak­ers has been ris­ing too. It would be great if the stock were do­ing well be­cause in­vestors ra­tio­nally worked out that elec­tric cars will take mar­ket share. In­stead, there has been an un­think­ing rush to buy stock in elec­tric-ve­hi­cle mak­ers, with many of the spec­u­la­tive pure-elec­tric-ve­hi­cle stocks that fell hard from a peak early this year leap­ing again in the past month (and Ford, with a new elec­tric F-150 on the way, soar­ing).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rivian Automotive priced its much anticipated initial public offering at $78 a share, a person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $78 is above the price range Rivian set last week. The all-electric truck maker had filed to offer 135 million shares at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/amazon-backed-rivian-to-go-public-next-week-51635855897?mod=article_inline&quot;&gt;$57 to $62&lt;/a&gt;. It boosted the price range to $72 to $74 a share on Nov. 5, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521321716/d157488ds1a.htm#toc157488_15&quot;&gt;according to a prospectus.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rivian will trade Wednesday on the Nasdaq under the ticker RIVN.  Morgan Stanley, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gs&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/a&gt;, and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rivian is valued at nearly $70 billion based on the 873.1 million shares outstanding if the underwriters exercise the so-called greenshoe. (The greenshoe allows underwriters on a deal to buy shares in the IPO at the offer price.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rivian’s near $70 billion valuation would surpass the market capitalization of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/hmc?mod=article_inline&quot;&gt;Honda Motor &lt;/a&gt;(ticker: HMC), which ended Tuesday with a $51 billion market cap, bringing Rivian closer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/f?mod=article_inline&quot;&gt;Ford Motor &lt;/a&gt;(F), an investor in Rivian, whose valuation was $80 billion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gm&quot;&gt;General Motors &lt;/a&gt;(GM) had an $85.1 billion market cap Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2009, Rivian makes all-electric pickup trucks and SUVs. It employed 9,195 people as of Oct. 30. The Irvine, Calif., company is considered one of the more serious rivals to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/tsla&quot;&gt;Tesla &lt;/a&gt;(TSLA), the leading EV manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality, augmented reality and metaverse. I daresay these are just the starting points to the entrance to a whole new alternate universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMD has partnerships with Microsoft and Sony for gaming console chips and now has signed up Meta (Facebook) as a new customer. We all know what Facebook was planning when it changed name to Meta and AMD is going to benefit tremendously from this partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s gradually taking away market share from Intel and soon we will reach a point where Intel might not even be a competitor to AMD. While the need for CPUs is here to stay, most future tech would be based on GPUs, a sector where AMD has a strong footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a long position in AMD, bought at 115. Would buy more before it hits 200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: adding a section to explain why GPUs would support future AI and VR tech more than CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPUs are better at performing mathematical and geometric calculations than CPUs. That&amp;#39;s why they are crucial for AI/ML and VR.
This is also why GPUs are used intensively for crypto mining. 
CPUs are crucial for putting everything together and perform code and logic processing. That&amp;#39;s why GPUs won&amp;#39;t replace CPUs but as we move towards more complex requirements for altverse, we would need powerful CPUs but we would need much more advanced GPUs. For instance take high end pc games. High end games can run on a mid-end I5 CPU but need a high end GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock market took a breather, putting a pause on this record-breaking rally, with all three major indexes closing the day lower. In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marci McGregor, Bank of America Merryl Lynch Senior Investment Strategist said, “I still think it’s all about corporate profits.  I know a lot of my peers are concerned that peak earnings growth is behind us. But I think peak earnings isn’t even a 2022 story. We’re seeing solid consumer demand, a strong U.S. economy, and I think we’re going to have a capex cycle in 2022. And I think that’s all positive for corporate profits, and that underpins this market, in my view.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite positive earnings, a host of companies have cited constraints around raw materials, labor shortages, and general supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. According to Bank of America, mentions of supply chains on quarterly earnings calls have surged by 360% compared to last year, underscoring the widespread nature of these pressures. These supply-related issues have also contributed to still-elevated inflationary trends. Tuesday&amp;#39;s Producer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that producer prices rose by 8.6% over last year, matching October&amp;#39;s rate for the fastest on record in data going back to Nov. 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco, said “I would expect inflation to peak by mid-year 2022. It should remain elevated but it should move lower in the back half of 2022. So while this is certainly an issue, it is part of what we should expect coming out of the pandemic. We have gotten out of a burning building, but we should expect that there is a little smoke and water damage as a result. That’s really what we’re experiencing with elevated inflation and supply chain disruptions”. I agree with this position and think the analogy is very apt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 10%, pushing down the entire EV sector with it, as the stock price feels the effect of Elon Musk’s poll where he said he would be selling 10% of his stake in Tesla. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;President Biden interviewed Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard for the job of Chairperson, signaling a serious rival to Jerome Powell Powell as Biden is set to nominate a new leader to the Fed in the coming weeks. I really hope Powell is re-assigned, the market does not need a shakeup right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peloton (PTON) continued its sharp drop following earnings, dispute the company revealing a new product designed to track your performance on the bike and give you feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roblox (RBLX) stock gapped up hard today while PayPal (PYPL) fell after reporting earnings yesterday afternoon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter (TWTR) launched a new subscription service, called Twitter Blue for $3 a month that allows one to undo or correct tweets, among other mostly aesthetic upgrades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA (NVDA), my favorite stock, said it was partnering with a range of self-driving sensor companies, including lidar firm Luminar Technologies (LAZR), to put together a system for autonomous driving as soon as 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, NVIDIA also announced it was releasing a set of tools, called “Omniverse Enterprise”. Their Omniverse, which was beta launched in December, is a simulation and collaboration platform which “serves as the connective tissue for physically accurate 3D virtual worlds,” according to the company. In prepared remarks, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in his keynote address that with Omniverse, “we now have the technology to create new 3D worlds or model our physical world.” Omniverse Enterprise, which costs $9,000 a year, is also available to customers in a 30-day trial. Just another example of how NVIDIA is going key to powering technology of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix (NFLX) is launching a new TikTok-like short clip feature for kids called “Kids Clips” as soon as this week. Netflix said it would add new shirts based on its current and future offerings.&lt;/li&gt;

But there were some really good nuggets in there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”The average stock doesn’t go up over long periods of time. The average stock will eventually go down 100% 
Indexes work because they weed those out and replace them”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shorting stocks is actually mathematically in your favor and that’s one of the secrets i have, that you have to search deeply for”
His sample portfolio was 40% long 40% short 20% cash he believes in being cash heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often should you trade stocks? 
“If you own a stock for 10 dollars and you think it’s worth 20 you want it to happen as fast as possible because of opportunity cost” 
I would rather make 20% in two weeks then 100% in 2 years” 
As long as you have other opportunities” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you think everything is overvalued or under valued 
You kind of suck and your process is not correct 
8/10 stocks should be fairly valued”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I studied pharma that helped me invest in biotech stocks that’s more important then 13f filings and listening to cnbc” 
The information I got from working in pharma
Made the 13f filings look like useless garbage in comparison”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The CEO is one of the most important factors, do you trust him to make big profits 10 years from now?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where boys Become men 
Most analysts don’t understand this,
Apples 
100 billion ev and
33 billion in profit 
Is 33% on your money 
It’s a calculation warren uses”
( this was years ago ) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Investing 1% in something that could 10x is good risk management” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to look at all stocks 
Imagine going to a restaurant and only eating one dish out of 800 dishes 
And saying this is the best dish for sure! 
You have to try the other dishes to get perspective and to maybe find something even better”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ USA has more fairly valued companies in general, International stocks 
Are either super undervalued or overvalued.
That’s what you want so you can buy undervalued and short overvalued”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I feel bad for people who look at p/e 
If Tesla is worth 50 billion 
And has 1 million in net profit it doesn’t mean it has 50 k p/e and should be avoided” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like companies who make people think with a different part of there brain. 
Like Apple and Tesla.
They don’t care about price they just have to have it. 
Usually great marketing, great design and a great product. 
With a great design comes a big price” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ very few people short sell
It could be good a lot of the time 
In 2000-2012 you wouldn’t make a penny if you were long. 
Markets go down often” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You want to be as diversified as you can”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t invest if you don’t have a good idea.
Hedge funds are forced too invest” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Leverage if you have confidence in the Investment 
I made 50 million in the last 2 years with options and derivatives.
But it is very risky so you have to be really sure”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Have a margin of safety”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Discount rate is gold 
It’s theoretical 
Basically you guess what growth they will have looking at the history of the company and you guess how long the company will stay alive. 
How much cash will it bring in, in its whole lifetime.
So Apple for example might bring in 300 billion a year in profit times 20 years.
Giving it a value of 6 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s all theoretical 
It might live for 30 years 
It might get a worse profit growth 
It might shrink by 15% per year instead of 2% 
You don’t know” 
You give them a discount rate based on how risky the investment is how diversified they are and how easy it is to eat there lunch.
This could take years as an investor to calculate correctly” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books he recommended 
- Margin of safety 
- common stocks and uncommon profits 
- everything from warren buffet and Charlie          munger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Michael Burry suggested Elon Musk might want to sell some Tesla stock to cover his personal debts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The Big Short&amp;quot; investor noted the Tesla CEO had 88 million shares pledged as loan collateral.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burry also made a subtle comparison between today&amp;#39;s market and the Dutch tulip bubble.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Burry rejoined Twitter this week to suggest why Elon Musk is suddenly interested in selling &lt;a href=&quot;https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stock, and to sound the alarm on dangerous speculation in financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Musk&amp;#39;s debts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Regarding what &lt;a href=&quot;/u/elonmusk&quot;&gt;u/elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; NEEDS to sell because of the proposed unrealized gains tax, or to #solveworldhunger, or ... well, there is the matter of the tax-free cash he took out in the form of personal loans backed by 88.3 million of his shares at June 30th,&amp;quot; the investor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1457902467669127170&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tweeted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-sell-tesla-stock-if-6-billion-solves-world-hunger-2021-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recently offered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to sell $6 billion worth of Tesla stock if UN bosses could explain to him how the sum would solve world hunger. The Tesla CEO also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-proposes-selling-10-percent-tesla-stock-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;launched a Twitter poll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; asking whether he should sell 10% of his holdings, citing pressure from US lawmakers who are pushing for a &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/taxing-billionaires-would-raise-557-billion-elon-musk-billionaire-tax2021-11?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;billionaire tax&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; that would target the ultra-wealthy&amp;#39;s unrealized stock gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burry&amp;#39;s tweet implies those might just be excuses. The investor of &amp;quot;The Big Short&amp;quot; fame and head of Scion Asset Management posted a link to a SEC filing in August, which noted that Musk has pledged about 88 million shares, or 36% of his total stake, as collateral for personal loans as of June 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk had 41% of his shares pledged as collateral for his debts at the end of December last year, and 48% as of June 30 last year, previous filings show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burry appears to be suggesting that Musk isn&amp;#39;t eyeing a stock sale in order to feed millions of people, in response to a legislative proposal, or because he could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-options-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;face a $10 billion tax bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when he exercises a slew of stock options that expire in August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Burry&amp;#39;s theory is that Musk needs some cash to service the loans he&amp;#39;s taken out using his Tesla stock. That practice &lt;a href=&quot;https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-criticized-avoiding-taxes-deserves-break-philanthropy-lifestyle-loopholes-2021-6?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;drew heavy scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this summer after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProPublica investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed how some of the world&amp;#39;s wealthiest people borrow against their stock to minimize their tax burdens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bubble fears&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides tweeting about Musk, Burry marked his return to Twitter with a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/header_photo&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;header image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His choice of &amp;quot;Satire of the Tulip Mania,&amp;quot; a painting by Jan Brueghel the Younger that ridicules the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/tulipmania-bubble-story-2014-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dutch tulip bubble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the 1600s, is undoubtedly a fresh warning about the current market mania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The painting depicts tulip speculators as mindless monkeys, and shows them weighing the bulbs, counting money, taking inventory, and going into debt, fighting over, and even dying for the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burry has &lt;a href=&quot;https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-tesla-robinhood-bitcoin-gamestop-bubble-2021-3?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;painted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the immense hype around meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, and the frantic buying of Tesla shares and other assets, as clear signs of rampant speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Burry has diagnosed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-warns-stocks-options-dotcom-bubble-crash-2021-9?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;historic market bubble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;predicted a devastating crash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in recent months. His fund also &lt;a href=&quot;https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-cathie-wood-ark-2021-8?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;held bearish put options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on shares of Tesla and Cathie Wood&amp;#39;s Ark Invest at the end of June. Given that context, his choice of Twitter image suggests he sees history repeating itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, a group of Republicans in Congress urged President Biden to keep the oil pipeline in operation, saying the termination of Line 5 would &amp;quot;undoubtedly further exacerbate shortages and price increases in home heating fuels like natural gas and propane.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian government has said a shutdown would require 2,100 rail cars to deliver oil from Superior, Wis., to the Imperial Oil refinery in Sarnia, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, pressure also comes from native and environmental groups to back Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who wants to shut down the 70-year-old pipeline over fears that a spill in the Straits of Mackinac would devastate the Great Lakes and coastal economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden, who promised at the COP26 climate talks that the U.S. would be &amp;quot;leading by the power of our example,&amp;quot; reportedly has not yet made a decision on the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are driverless buses operating on specific routes as far and wide as Spain, Australia and China already - the routes extensive in China.  WeRide is offering Level 4   cargo deliveries in China.  It also offers Robo-taxis along with several other firms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the media, analyst and investor hype over Tesla&amp;#39;s self-driving possibilities continue,  other companies continue to actually already deploy real robo-taxis, even in major US cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla, under scrutiny of the NHSTA, still struggles with level 2/3 driving by its own admissions (see recent earnings), whilst it&amp;#39;s competitors are clearly beating it in the race to offer robo-taxis, already deploying them in some major global cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise the Tesla Board and now Musk are looking to sell shares, for &amp;#39;tax&amp;#39; purposes or otherwise.  Tesla is falling quickly down the EV sales rankings in Europe (only 7% of EV sales YTD) and China (only 9% of EV sales YTD) where EV sales are growing rapidly and will likely hit 20% of automotive sales this year (the US might be 3%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investor narrative over Tesla and the market capitalisation is now so far removed from the realities of Tesla&amp;#39;s position in the EV market or indeed it&amp;#39;s realistic future revenue sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input prices are certainly increasing. For those of you who don’t know what they mean by “wholesale prices,” this is the price increase of bulk goods and services businesses use to make their end product or service. As to how bad this is … I’ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime. Inflation data comes out tomorrow. … which will likely be amplified by today’s Producer Price Index. Two of the big drivers were gasoline and the cost of autos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big takeaway for today is that businesses are paying more for the wholesale goods they need to operate and this will likely be reflected in the CPI tomorrow. In short, the companies you are invested in will need to contend with higher input prices by increasing the cost of goods and services (or reinvesting to become more efficient) which will in turn result in the less people can afford to buy on a limited income. If this hits a tipping point where wages are increasing slowly with inflation increasing quickly, people with limited wages will be forced to buy their needs at higher prices and budget on the want side, resulting in less sales of goods people can go without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it&amp;#39;s also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel&amp;#39;s 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, TSMC&amp;#39;s market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that&amp;#39;s a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don&amp;#39;t know how big this will be in 10 years, but it&amp;#39;s likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that&amp;#39;s also something that&amp;#39;s worth noting at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel&amp;#39;s lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel&amp;#39;s management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that&amp;#39;s good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it&amp;#39;s near that range right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bear Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit&amp;#39;s circejerk. So, it&amp;#39;s difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management&amp;#39;s conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn&amp;#39;t care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division&amp;#39;s predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/xxYyDIE&quot;&gt;positions or ban. bought 100 shares for now. will be selling some puts to enter into more. And then around the next earnings, will buy some calls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I feel like I do. I have this irrational fear that the minute I put any money into the markets, a 2nd Black Monday would happen. That would just be my luck. However I also know that with my money just sitting in my savings account, I know I’m still losing to inflation. Just not as quickly as I would if the market were to crash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it also comes from the fact that my family was dirt poor growing up, living in shitty pay by the week motels or in our old Plymouth Voyager when things got really bad. That I cling tightly to my money for a fear of ending up in the poor house again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I overcome this fear of investing and getting into the markets?&lt;/p&gt;
