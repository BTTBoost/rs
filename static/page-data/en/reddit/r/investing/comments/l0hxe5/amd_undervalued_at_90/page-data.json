As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I’ve made a previous <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/\">post</a> about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intel struggles</strong></p>\n\n<p>Last week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>AMD Q4 and FY</strong></p>\n\n<p>EPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>2021&amp;2022 Outlook</strong></p>\n\n<p>But the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC’s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU’s that can go head to head with NVDA’s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E’s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML’s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Booming Market</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Position:</p>\n\n<p>2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan’21 100Calls.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l0hxe5/amd_undervalued_at_90/","title":"AMD: Undervalued at $90","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-19T14:18:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-19 14:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ba46dd54-79c3-58cf-8e89-f173b4316e2b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l0hxe5/amd_undervalued_at_90/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l0hxe5/amd_undervalued_at_90/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"alles_long","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/alles_long","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"alles_long","score":932,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AMD：价值被低估在90美元","the_new_excerpt":"AMD将于26日公布2020年第四季度业绩。作为一个长期投资者和\n考虑到过去几个月发生的所有事件，我相信AMD的价值仍然被低估了。\n$90. 我以前发过一个帖子\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/]\n但有一些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMD：價值被低估在90美元","the_new_excerpt":"AMD將於26日公佈2020年第四季度業績。作爲一個長期投資者和\n考慮到過去幾個月發生的所有事件，我相信AMD的價值仍然被低估了。\n$90. 我以前發過一個帖子\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/]\n但有一些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-7f5c4c86-2ad8-53d7-9a8c-af7494186c2b","excerpt":"Ceragon Networks Ltd (Ceragon) is a wireless hauling specialist.
