Because I&#39;ve learned so much from reading other people&#39;s investment stories, I thought I&#39;d share my own. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Ph.D. dropout from an English-speaking country. I have no financial support from my parents. My dream was to come to the US and build a life for myself. When I was 36, I moved to San Francisco, which is where I live today. I work in the technology sector (but not as a software developer). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Investment Goal</strong>: My original motivation was to merely have a financial net for retirement, to supplement a middle-income life. In 2012, I wrote that my near-term goal was to have $250K in tax-advantaged accounts by the time I was 40, which should approximately grow to $1MM over the successive years. With 16 months to go, I&#39;ve exceeded that goal by more than 2X. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Allocation</strong>: 75% VT/25% BND. Some retirement accounts have an approximation of this allocation, but the general allocation holds. I&#39;m roughly using an &quot;age-minus-10&quot; allocation to bonds. (For example, when I&#39;m 40, I&#39;ll have an allocation of 70% VT/30% BND and so on.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Net Worth Breakdown:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>$80K in Roth IRA</p>\n\n<p>$300K in 401(k)</p>\n\n<p>$108K in After-Tax Roth 401(k) </p>\n\n<p>$13K in HSA</p>\n\n<p>$7K in Taxable (VT)</p>\n\n<p>$12K in BTC</p>\n\n<p>$25K Emergency Fund (not counted in net worth)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Worked for Me</strong>: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I&#39;ve saved on transportation by never owning a car. For the past ten years, I&#39;ve made a concerted decision to live within walking distance to work. Whenever I need a car, I rent one or get a lift from a friend.</li>\n<li>Not buying a house. I&#39;m happy for everyone who has seen handsome returns on their homes. But I don&#39;t regret renting for a second. I&#39;ve moved to seven apartments across three cities in the last decade, enabling me to always choose lodging that made sense for my career (not the other way around.</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve saved on housing by choosing to live in 1BR apartments. My rental costs are high ($2800/month), but the median for San Francisco. I could have lived in less expensive housing, but that might likely have taken me further from my office and city life. </li>\n<li>Opportunity hopping was critical to my success. Last year, I hopped jobs for a 20% salary boost. Four years ago, I hopped for a 30% boost. </li>\n<li>I&#39;ve built a tremendously valuable network of mentors and colleagues that helped improve my confidence on the job hunt. Were it not for my former business colleague telling me she thought I had the talent to work for a big tech company, I probably never would have applied. </li>\n<li>I applied to multiple roles when I was looking to switch companies. This gave me leverage during salary negotiations and also helped me truly understand my market value. (Despite what anyone says, you never actually know your market value until you have a written offer in hand.)</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve automated all of my investing. I&#39;ve never tried to time the market. (Thank you, Bogle.)</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve had a fun time while saving. I have a vibrant social life. I&#39;ve never cheaped out on the opportunity to meet friends for cocktails or a nice dinner, but I rarely splurge on ostentatious outings, like a $3K trip to Coachella.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>What Didn&#39;t Work</strong>: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My divorce in 2015 was almost certainly impacted by being so career-driven. I had a dream to move to California. She did not. </li>\n<li>I haven&#39;t done a good job at keeping up with my passion for music. At one point in my life, I wanted to be a professional musician. That dream faded as my focus on my career intensified. </li>\n<li>I didn&#39;t have a plan for what might happen if I hit my investing goal so early. I&#39;m dumbfounded by whether to continue investing so aggressively or to take it easy and buy a Rolex. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Do I really want to retire early if I can? What am I saving for? I&#39;ve done a good job in hitting my goal, and I&#39;m grateful for Bogleheads keeping me on track. (But I can&#39;t help realizing that my investment policy statement needs an existential addendum on how I want to design the rest of my life.)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Year</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Earnings</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Net Worth*</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Milestones</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2011</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$0K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-$35K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">US permanent residency obtained.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2012</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$31K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-$30K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">First 9-5 job.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2013</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$52K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">-$15K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Promotion.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2014</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$70K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$10K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Promotion.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2015</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$80K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$60K</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Promotion.
