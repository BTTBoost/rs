They do this by partnering with roughly 200 family farms that share the mentality of putting the welfare of the animals before anything else and engaging in sustainable farming practices. All of the farms are located in “The Pasture Belt”, an area notorious for favorable weather all year long.</p>\n\n<h1>Management and employee satisfaction</h1>\n\n<p>The company was founded by Matt O’Hayer in 2007. He is the founder and former president of the Organic Egg Farmers of America and is still the Executive Chairman and Director of Vital Farms.</p>\n\n<p>The current CEO is Russell Diez-Canseco. Previous work experience includes McKinsey &amp; Company, H-E-B Grocery, and the Central Intelligence Agency (he also has an MBA from Harvard University).</p>\n\n<p>Other senior management members have extensive experience in the food industry.</p>\n\n<p>The company has a 4.2 rating on Glassdoor (50 reviews), 88% approval of the CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and motivation with the company’s ethical mission. A few reviews complain about managers (not uncommon on Glassdoor) and about the company’s culture.</p>\n\n<h1>Industry and competition</h1>\n\n<p>Vital Farms is active in the highly-competitive and fragmented US food industry with a focus on retail consumers and a few partnerships with restaurants.</p>\n\n<p>Notable competitors include Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ: CALM), Rose Care Farms and other major US egg producers.</p>\n\n<h1>Moats and competitive advantages</h1>\n\n<p>Vital Farms differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on the ethical side of the production and farming of its eggs and dairy products. Customers and reviewers claim the products are of higher quality and of greater taste due to the production approach they’re taking. Customer reviews and satisfaction is extremely high (their standard egg carton has a 4.9 out of 5 rating on Amazon based on 5,985 reviews with customers praising the premium quality).</p>\n\n<p>Although their eggs are pricier than competitors, consumers haven’t been minding shelling out the difference for the premium quality. </p>\n\n<p>Their marketing is unique and exceptional amongst competitors. To exemplify a part of this, they allow buyers to check out the farm where their eggs were laid in a 360 degree video to see if it’s up to snuff and they have a reward program for filling up a “pasture passport” with the names of 10 different farms.</p>\n\n<p>Their branding and packaging is also really strong and although it is still a small company, it is starting to show strong brand loyalty among its consumers (a significant percentage of first-time buyers during the COVID-19 pandemic became repeat buyers according to the CEO).</p>\n\n<p>Although the company does not have a truly strong moat at the moment, in my opinion they’re well on their way to building themselves one by the customer loyalty they’re amassing and the network of small farms they’re building.</p>\n\n<h1>Areas of growth</h1>\n\n<p>The company has been willing and adventurous when it comes to expanding their product line into sub-products (Egg bites, hard boiled eggs, liquid whole eggs) and completely new segments (butter). A natural next-step for the company at this point, in my opinion, would be to expand their dairy products further (milk, cream, etc.) to tap into other large markets.</p>\n\n<p>Partnerships with large restaurant chains willing to back sustainable farming practices could also be a catalyst for growth.</p>\n\n<p>One could argue there is also potential internationally for Vital Farms, but I believe this is very far-off the current road-map. </p>\n\n<h1>Potential headwinds</h1>\n\n<p>As previously mentioned, the industry they operate in is highly fragmented and it’s unlikely Vital Farms will own a majority of market share in their segment. The egg and dairy industry is also notoriously smaller and has a lower CAGR than other high-flying fast-growing industries, so Vital Farm’s TAM and market cap growth is capped unless they manage to go international successfully or tap into new product and revenue streams.</p>\n\n<h1>Institutional and insider ownership, short interest</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Institutional ownership sits at about 51-52% (including a 4.1% indirect ownership by Amazon.com).</p></li>\n<li><p>Insider ownership: </p></li>\n<li><p>Mathew O’Hayer (Founder, chairman): 10,650,494 shares </p></li>\n<li><p>Brent Drever (Board Member): 2,533,512 shares </p></li>\n<li><p>Karl Khoury (Board Member): 1,780,380 shares</p></li>\n<li><p>Glenda J.
