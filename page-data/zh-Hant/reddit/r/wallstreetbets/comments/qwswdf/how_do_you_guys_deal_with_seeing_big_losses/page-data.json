I was having fun just moving shares around and making small amounts of money. Then a few weeks ago I decided to try options. I bought an apple call that went up a couple hundred bucks. I was amazed at how easy it was to make money with options. Then I decided to put a bunch of money into Delta Airlines calls expiring in January and February. Initially they went up, and I was making more money than ever before. But then they started to go down. As I&#39;m writing this, my weekly chart is down almost 20%. This is all the money I had in my saving account. I&#39;m not sure when I will crack, but at this rate it will be sometime soon. I&#39;m still holding, but I can&#39;t focus on school or anything else because all I can think about is how much money I&#39;m losing.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, how do you guys deal with waking up in the morning and seeing huge losses? How do you keep going?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks for all the great advice guys! So many responses! For now my plan is to keep holding because my <a href=\"http://imgur.com/uV6mzeO\">fortune cookie </a>from lunch told me to, and I still have a few months till the calls expire.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwswdf/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_seeing_big_losses/","title":"How do you guys deal with seeing big losses?","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"November 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-19T02:08:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-19 02:08","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qwswdf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwswdf/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_seeing_big_losses/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qwswdf/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_seeing_big_losses/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/JF02M4-69_r7Rjwg8c8D68MxHQICT6MG3h2zzCJKt18.jpg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=69dbac0ee205e6ad1cb9ba60f4391bea7c7a518b","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"BootyHunter40","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BootyHunter40","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BootyHunter40","score":1343,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"皆さんは、大きな損失を目の当たりにしたとき、どのように対処していますか？","the_new_excerpt":"私は最近、株式市場に挑戦することを決めた大学生です。\n株を動かして小銭を稼ぐのが楽しくて仕方がありませんでした。\nそして数週間前、私はオプションを試してみることにしました。数百ドル上がったアップルのコールを買いました。\n数百ドル上がったアップルのコールを買いました。驚いたのは、こんなに簡単に...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你们是如何处理看到大的损失的？","the_new_excerpt":"我是一名大学生，最近决定在股票市场上尝试一下。\n我只是把股票搬来搬去，赚点小钱，很是开心。\n然后几周前，我决定尝试一下期权。我买了一个苹果看涨期权，涨了\n涨了几百块钱。我很惊讶于它是多么容易......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們是如何處理看到大的損失的？","the_new_excerpt":"我是一名大學生，最近決定在股票市場上嘗試一下。\n我只是把股票搬來搬去，賺點小錢，很是開心。\n然後幾周前，我決定嘗試一下期權。我買了一個蘋果看漲期權，漲了\n漲了幾百塊錢。我很驚訝於它是多麼容易......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qx1l1a","excerpt":"Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia.
