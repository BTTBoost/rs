The amendments were first proposed last year, but market participants assumed until recent months that the rules would continue to pertain to the stock market alone.</p>\n\n<p>“We believe that such an application of the rule is overbroad and unnecessary”, wrote the Bond Dealers of America and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC’s 1971 statute, known as ‘rule 15c2-11’, governs the “publication or submission” of prices to buy and sell securities away from exchanges. Market participants have largely considered it an attempt to guard retail investors from predatory schemes and fraudulent activity in penny stocks. </p>\n\n<p>The rule requires broker dealers such as JPMorgan Chase and Citi to check a wide range of information on issuers, including quarterly and annual reports. Last year the SEC, then led by Jay Clayton, tweaked the rules for the first time in almost three decades, and included a requirement for the information to be publicly available.</p>\n\n<p>“These retail investor-focused improvements to Rule 15c2-11 are long overdue,” said Clayton at the time, adding that advances in technology meant investors could be privy to more up-to-date information before trading.</p>\n\n<p>The statute has never explicitly excluded bonds but, in practice, it has never applied to them in its 50-year existence. This has long suited a market where many corporate issuers are not listed on stock markets and do not routinely produce regular earnings reports. It is unclear what disclosures would be required for government bonds, such as those issued by the US Treasury.</p>\n\n<p>But Michael Decker, vice-president of policy and research at BDA, said the SEC, led by new chief Gary Gensler, has confirmed the rules will also affect government and corporate bonds under the amendments outlined last year. Only municipal securities have an explicit exemption. </p>\n\n<p>“Here we are a matter of days away and very little work has been done. It is pretty clear to me that the SEC hasn’t really thought this through,” said Decker.</p>\n\n<p>The SEC declined to comment. </p>\n\n<p>Rising awareness of the new requirements has sown confusion in the bond market as bankers, trading platforms and investors now face intense compliance demands ahead of an unforeseen month-end deadline. </p>\n\n<p>The concern is that without guidance or amendment from the SEC, trading in part of the bond market will cease when the rule comes into force at the end of this month, as broker dealers back away for fear of attracting an enforcement action from securities regulators. </p>\n\n<p>The SEC’s move comes at a time of increasing regulatory scrutiny of fixed income trading, with Gensler noting this month that he intends to bring greater efficiency and transparency to the market. </p>\n\n<p>Broker dealers are scrambling to understand how to gather, review and publish information on the companies whose bonds they trade. They are also questioning what counts as publication or submission of a quote on a bond — terms left undefined in the rule.</p>\n\n<p>Bond trading has increasingly transitioned to trading on electronic venues, with prices streamed on screens. In an attempt to avoid publishing quotes, some market participants could shift trading back to phones until clearer guidance is available. </p>\n\n<p>“The risk is that if the broker dealers feel they can’t be in compliance based on the interpretation of their internal teams then they might be forced to stop quoting certain bonds to ensure they aren’t out of compliance,” said Kevin McPartland, head of research, market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ptn7fi/us_bond_lobbies_warn_sec_of_severe_disruption/","title":"US bond lobbies warn SEC of severe disruption under rule change","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-23T14:41:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-23 14:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ptn7fi","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ptn7fi/us_bond_lobbies_warn_sec_of_severe_disruption/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ptn7fi/us_bond_lobbies_warn_sec_of_severe_disruption/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"nafizzaki","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nafizzaki","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"nafizzaki","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"米国の債券関連団体がSECにルール変更による深刻な混乱を警告","the_new_excerpt":"ロビー団体は、世界最大の債券市場の活動が今月末に停止する可能性があると警告している。\nロビー団体は、世界最大の債券市場の活動が、今月末に停止する可能性があると警告している。\n米国では50年前に制定された曖昧なルールがあり、これまでは株式のみを対象としていた。\n\n債券の業界団体は、規制当局に手紙を出して、このように述べている。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国债券游说团体警告美国证券交易委员会在规则修改下会出现严重混乱","the_new_excerpt":"游说团体警告说，如果没有最后一刻的豁免，世界上最大的债券市场的活动可能会在本月底陷入停滞。\n如果没有最后一刻对美国一项有50年历史的模糊规则的豁免，世界上最大的债券市场的活动可能在本月底陷入停顿。\n美国一项有50年历史的晦涩规则，以前只针对股票。\n\n债券贸易协会已经写信给监管机构，表示...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國債券遊說團體警告美國證券交易委員會在規則修改下會出現嚴重混亂","the_new_excerpt":"遊說團體警告說，如果沒有最後一刻的豁免，世界上最大的債券市場的活動可能會在本月底陷入停滯。\n如果沒有最後一刻對美國一項有50年曆史的模糊規則的豁免，世界上最大的債券市場的活動可能在本月底陷入停頓。\n美國一項有50年曆史的晦澀規則，以前只針對股票。\n\n債券貿易協會已經寫信給監管機構，表示...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pttqnc","excerpt":"Alright yeh lovely apes, got a chart here of $GOEV - Canoo, and it looks like\nits been battered and shorted like crazy since December.
