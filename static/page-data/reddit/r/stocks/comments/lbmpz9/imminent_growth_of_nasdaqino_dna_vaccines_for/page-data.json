The technology can be targeted to specific types of cancer and immune diseases, such as those produced by a virus.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>The inovio vaccine pipeline will trigger a paradigm shift in medicine. on a side note, INO will most probably release a COVID vaccine this year. Short-term growth of INO will be fueled by INO-4800, a DNA vaccine candidate to protect against coronavirus :</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Inovio/comments/l6vg0z/why_inovio_deserves_a_200_plus_valuation/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Inovio/comments/l6vg0z/why_inovio_deserves_a_200_plus_valuation/</a></p>\n\n<p>make no mistake : hedge funds, banks, and other big players have been scooping up INO shares on the cheap :</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
