The guy also owes loans taken out against borrowed stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk and other executives have many other generous in the money stock option awards, that will require both collateral to exercise and tax to be paid which can only realistically come from share sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shares would have had to be sold at some point, irrespective of his Twitter poll outcome.  More theatrics from Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla shareholders, like.most company shareholders in their defence, so often overlook the dilution effect of stock options and the inevitable share sell down by executives to cover the collateral needed to exercise the options and to pay any taxes due.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chip giant said its EPYC chips were selected by Meta (formerly known as Facebook) to help power its data centers at its virtual Accelerated Data Center Premiere event Monday. AMD explained the two companies worked together to develop a high-performance, power-efficient processor based on the company&amp;#39;s 3rd Generation EPYC processor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-profile win accompanied several announcements from AMD, including some specifics around upcoming EPYC processors codenamed “Genoa” and “Bergamo.” AMD dubbed the Genoa processor as the &amp;quot;world’s highest performance processor for general purpose computing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The magnitude of the expected rate hike is tiny, maybe a quarter-percent. If you are of the belief that supply-chain shortages will last well into 2022, this is hilariously inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we&amp;#39;ve seen from 10 years of monetary experiments that the direct relationship between inflation and the state of the economy + monetary policy is tenuous at best. And this has benefitted the economy at large as we have pumped more and more money and cheap debt into the system with no apparent ill effects (except the ones that we choose to ignore, but I&amp;#39;m not here to beat that debt horse!). So it&amp;#39;s already ridiculous to believe that the converse won&amp;#39;t also be true. A 25 basis-point increase will do nothing to temper inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have a new phenomenon that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seem to have a strong connection to inflation, both in theory and in practice. Inflation expectations among spenders and workers are higher than they&amp;#39;ve been in over a decade, wage increases at the bottom are faster than they&amp;#39;ve been in over a decade, and supply chains are more constricted than they&amp;#39;ve been in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if inflation persists, even at the not-hyper-inflation levels we&amp;#39;re currently seeing, it&amp;#39;s not a stretch to see that the Fed will have to make moves that shatter the confidence driving the second point. Once you accept the first point, that the Fed&amp;#39;s tools have a weak causal relationship with inflation, it&amp;#39;s clear that the only way they can stop inflation is to raise interest rates enough to tank assets, which will shake consumer confidence and bring demand in equilibrium with supply. If that isn&amp;#39;t enough, they will be forced to go further and cause a recession, although this will take a lot of pushing, given their need to balance against the full employment mandate. Either way, I think we can all agree a quarter rate increase will do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious what other people&amp;#39;s thoughts are. I&amp;#39;m not making any earth-shattering new statements, just connecting dots. To me, this outcome flows logically from the two points above, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you believe that higher inflation (but not hyper-inflation) will be persistent into next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even state-owned firms are safe from the deepening rout in Chinese developer bonds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino  Ocean Group Holding Ltd., part-owned by the finance ministry, has  become the latest property company to see its bonds slump. Its 4.75%  note due 2030 fell Monday to as low as 73.48 cents on the dollar, with  spreads over comparable Treasuries widening to a record 800 basis  points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s  despite the firm being rated investment-grade at two global credit  assessors and holding about 54 times more cash and equivalents than  China Evergrande Group. Sino Ocean’s shares have been doing better,  rebounding 35% from their September low. They rose 3.5% Monday.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress  in the market for Chinese property bonds is reaching extreme levels as  surging borrowing costs make refinancing dollar debt too expensive and a  slowing housing market shrinks revenue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s  finance ministry controls just under 30% of Sino Ocean’s shares,  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. State-owned Dajia Insurance  Group -- the company that took over most of the operations of troubled  Anbang Insurance Group Co. -- holds a similar-sized stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Does the federal reserve “like” inflation? It would seem to me that it should and shouldn’t. If the fed is in debt, shouldn’t it “want” inflation in order to lower the value of the debt it has to pay back? But the fed is also suppose to “control/manage” inflation so that seems like a pretty weird love triangle. And lastly, is the federal reserve in debt? How does debt work with the federal reserve and who are they in debt with and how are they in debt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some pretty surface level knowledge and understanding of the federal reserve but trying to understand its motives for the things it does has been very confusing so thank you to anyone who can shed some light on these questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything else that anyone thinks is worth mentioning, like how these things effect markets etc… please share, it doesn’t have to be directly related to what I was questioning as there are so many things that I don’t understand enough to even ask the right questions on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Funds are being paid for through my Fidelity Roth IRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should go with a higher number than my retirement age so the stocks and bonds will still be aggressive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also If I go with the 2060 target date can I still use the funds at my real retirement age of 65?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or would I be penalized, and therefore would truly have to wait until 2060(into my 70&amp;#39;s) to use the funds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does it not matter either way? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, Can you go into a target-date fund(filled by a Roth IRA) without penalty and a little before the target date closes?&lt;/p&gt;
