It&#39;s an 8-page document you can find <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqTxYRG1aWyfh8J6QZg_zL6Z7QIKtXJj/view?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Mother of all TA for the Mother of All Squeezes</h1>\n\n<h1>WHY GME WILL SQUEEZE MORE THAN ONCE</h1>\n\n<p>Warning – no rocket emojis or wife’s boyfriend jokes here. The tendies we are about to suckle upon are above jokes. This is serious fucking tendies. Intergalactic fucking tendies.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Just some hardcore TA to confirm your bias. There are charts and math. Sorry. But if you read the charts and can take your pants off to count to .05mm then you’ll find out that the shorters are fucking fucked fuckily. And there’s math to prove it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If you do read the linked TA/DD (which I know 98% of you won’t) I hope you can use it as a way to get ahead without having to spend the time I did to look all this up and learn it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I am not in finance and I’m not going to lie and said I spent 40 hours a week reading up on this for months. I’ve just done the homework and took the time to learn how the Wall Street chads talk.<br/>\n <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCIo4MCO-_U\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCIo4MCO-_U</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Here is the summary:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> There will not be <strong><em>a</em></strong> GME squeeze.</li>\n<li> There will be at least two. There could be more.  I need some people less retarded than me to check my math on this.</li>\n<li> Tomorrow I’ll buy GME calls – even deeply OTM. Weeklies could be fine. Go further ou if you don’t want the risk. EDIT: as <a href=\"/u/StarSwitch\">u/StarSwitch</a> taught me, ATM calls and calls closer to share price will cause MMs to cover it with shares. So calls up and down the call chain are muy bueno and shit.<br/></li>\n<li> All fucking hell may break loose on Thursday morning. The NYSE reports short position at market close on Wednesday.  Some analysts are quietly saying that shorts could be 300-400% of the float now. </li>\n<li> I’m already in on GME shares (over 1700) but I’ll buy more. (Positions at bottom of post)</li>\n<li> EVERY SINGLE indicator shows massive upward momentum on GME.</li>\n<li> GME momentum is going to create a massive upward feedback loop. The combination of options gamma squeeze, available float, and short interest makes it impossible for shorters to escape.</li>\n<li> Normally, shorters deep underwater could hedge their losses by buying call options.</li>\n<li> But buying call options decreases the float and the only tightens the squeeze. It’s like fighting against quicksand for the shorters.</li>\n<li>This GME squeeze is going to be historic because of the compounding effect of options and short interest.</li>\n<li>This could be bigger than the VW/Porsche infinity squeeze. But it’s completely different from VW – so don’t draw too many comparisons.</li>\n<li>This squeeze could happen without Papa Cohen action but if Cohen does anything soon then GME is going to uncharted territory somewhere in another universe (forget the moon or some other place in this universe.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>GME Position: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/803jawkihdd61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d7edd5da0e7740fb666288b82ea500e82b356c\">Fuck you Melvin</a></p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Sorry about the video link.
