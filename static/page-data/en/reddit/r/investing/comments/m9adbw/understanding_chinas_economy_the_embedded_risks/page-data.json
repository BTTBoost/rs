Why? Because it&#39;s the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of *potential* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why This is Important for Currency Markets &amp; The RMB</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you watch this, you&#39;ll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#39;t want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.</p>\n\n<p>In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the &quot;there is no alternative&quot; effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m9adbw/understanding_chinas_economy_the_embedded_risks/","title":"Understanding China's economy & the embedded risks: This video has a surprisingly balanced and good take describing a lot of the risks and drivers of the Chinese economy.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-21T11:39:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-21 11:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"acab46ac-4453-5a1c-aa1a-7aac1f8e4b70","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m9adbw/understanding_chinas_economy_the_embedded_risks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m9adbw/understanding_chinas_economy_the_embedded_risks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"cbus20122","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cbus20122","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cbus20122","score":69,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"理解中国经济&蕴含的风险。这段视频出人意料的平衡，很好的描述了很多中国经济的风险和驱动力。","the_new_excerpt":"请在这里观看视频https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg\n\n\n概述\n\n如果有谁见过我在这里发帖，他们会意识到我早已是\n跟着中国经济的发展。为什么这么说呢？因为它是全球的主要驱动力。\n现在的经济。而在这之上，还有很多的。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"理解中國經濟&蘊含的風險。這段視頻出人意料的平衡，很好的描述了很多中國經濟的風險和驅動力。","the_new_excerpt":"請在這裏觀看視頻https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg\n\n\n概述\n\n如果有誰見過我在這裏發帖，他們會意識到我早已是\n跟着中國經濟的發展。爲什麼這麼說呢？因爲它是全球的主要驅動力。\n現在的經濟。而在這之上，還有很多的。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-12184bf0-06db-560d-a378-936d1a3b8297","excerpt":"Financial Market Pessimism\n\nI have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons\nbelow.
