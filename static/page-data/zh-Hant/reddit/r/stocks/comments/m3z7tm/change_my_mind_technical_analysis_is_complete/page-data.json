There have been many studies that prove the natural randomness of the stock market overshadows any patterns and predictions that could be made and your chance of predicting a stocks movement off of TA is basically that of a coin flip. Fundamental analysis, news and the current trend and sentiment of the market are infinitely more important for predicting a stocks immediate movement than TA could ever be.</p>\n\n<p>The only glimmer of credibility I’d be willing to give TA is scalping but even then 90% of daytraders lose money so id say it’s not even paying off for them well in that regard either.</p>\n\n<p>What it feels like to me is TA is a “noob trap” that attracts people who are new to the stock market because it makes them feel like they know what they are doing and they want an excuse to just gamble away their money. I’ve noticed a lot of YouTube channels prey off of people thinking they’re some God of the stock market for employing TA and it gives them false credibility when in reality they’re just guessing as much as anyone. Like some fake scam psychic tarot card reading shit. </p>\n\n<p>Not really looking for anyone to change my mind, I just had to get this out of my system although I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m3z7tm/change_my_mind_technical_analysis_is_complete/","title":"Change my mind: Technical Analysis is complete bullshit","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-13T06:40:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-13 06:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"dc17739a-dc68-5745-aab7-a8409f7bc403","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3z7tm/change_my_mind_technical_analysis_is_complete/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3z7tm/change_my_mind_technical_analysis_is_complete/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"thecheese27","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/thecheese27","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"thecheese27","score":835,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"改变我的想法。技术分析完全是扯淡","the_new_excerpt":"我在浏览subreddits的时候，看到一个又一个的帖子在讨论\nXYZ如何形成双天顶超谐波收敛，并即将\n扑朔迷离，其实这种 \"模式 \"并无可取之处。\n什么都没有，股票继续随机移动。\n\n这是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"改變我的想法。技術分析完全是扯淡","the_new_excerpt":"我在瀏覽subreddits的時候，看到一個又一個的帖子在討論\nXYZ如何形成雙天頂超諧波收斂，並即將\n撲朔迷離，其實這種 \"模式 \"並無可取之處。\n什麼都沒有，股票繼續隨機移動。\n\n這是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f6c9b58b-e562-5d29-82e4-806a98966948","excerpt":"TLDR: Put \"-fool\" in every google search\n\nIf you're like me and think Motley Fools articles are absolutely absurd and hate\nseeing them spammed across every DD search for stocks or companies, filter out\nevery Motley Fool article by placing \"-fool\" at the end of google searches.\n\nIt's like subtracting…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m3z86k/how_to_avoid_motley_fool_articles/","title":"How to avoid Motley Fool articles","date":"March 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"如何避免Motley Fool的文章","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR: 把\"-fool \"放在每个谷歌搜索中\n\n如果你和我一样，认为Motley Fools的文章绝对是荒谬的，讨厌的。\n看到他们在每一个DD搜索股票或公司的垃圾邮件，过滤掉。\n每一个Motley Fool的文章，通过放置\"-fool \"在谷歌搜索的结束。\n\n这就像减去... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何避免Motley Fool的文章","the_new_excerpt":"TLDR: 把\"-fool \"放在每個谷歌搜索中\n\n如果你和我一樣，認爲Motley Fools的文章絕對是荒謬的，討厭的。\n看到他們在每一個DD搜索股票或公司的垃圾郵件，過濾掉。\n每一個Motley Fool的文章，通過放置\"-fool \"在谷歌搜索的結束。\n\n這就像減去... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2674d1d9-20eb-5eee-8d7b-ffe7e3a160f0","excerpt":"I am building up a small portfolio as a 21 year old and I was hoping to hear\nyour thoughts on which companies you feel are best in value, growth, dividend,\nor whatever makes them your favorite per industry!
