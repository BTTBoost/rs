It has had a nice little correction in the last couple weeks. I feel like the world is dangerously dependent on them and as EV boom continues the demand for semiconductors is only going to increase. </p>\n\n<p>Then, I just happened to stumble upon the HSBC MSCI Taiwan UCITS ETF. It is 32% exposure to TSM and 5% each to couple of other solid Taiwanese companies like Media Tek and Hon Hai. It also has ~3% in United Microelectronics Corp which is another solid company! </p>\n\n<p>I feel like the ETF would be a better choice than going for a single stock in TSM. Does anyone else have a position in either of the two or care to share their two cents?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/la2trf/taiwan_semiconductor_manufacturing/","title":"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T22:30:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 22:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a259a09b-0271-566b-b261-81c5b482ad0d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la2trf/taiwan_semiconductor_manufacturing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la2trf/taiwan_semiconductor_manufacturing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"pratikz1309","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pratikz1309","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"pratikz1309","score":128,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"台湾半导体制造","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在考虑进入台湾半导体公司任职。\n在过去的一周里，制造公司。它有一个漂亮的小修正，在\n过去几周。我觉得这个世界很危险地依赖于他们，而作为。\n电动车热潮持续对半导体的需求只会...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"臺灣半導體制造","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在考慮進入臺灣半導體公司任職。\n在過去的一週裏，製造公司。它有一個漂亮的小修正，在\n過去幾周。我覺得這個世界很危險地依賴於他們，而作爲。\n電動車熱潮持續對半導體的需求只會...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1356321355105501189","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1356321355105501189","title":"Netflix is already in talks to make a movie about the events over the past week. \n\nSo is Amazon.
