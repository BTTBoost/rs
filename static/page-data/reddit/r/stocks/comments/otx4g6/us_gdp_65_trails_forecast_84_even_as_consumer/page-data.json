Federal government outlays, residential  investment and inventories weighed on the figure.</p>\n\n<p>Personal consumption, the biggest part of the economy, advanced an annualized 11.8%.</p>\n\n<p>The  inflation-adjusted value of domestically produced goods and services  climbed to an annualized $19.36 trillion, eclipsing its pre-pandemic  peak.</p>\n\n<p>The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists  called for an 8.4% increase in second-quarter GDP. Stock-index futures  climbed after the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose  and the dollar weakened.</p>\n\n<p>Emboldened by vaccinations, federal  financial relief and a broader reopening of the economy, Americans had  both the wherewithal and the opportunity to ramp up spending on services  such as dining out. The extra cash paired with robust hiring helped  sustain outlays for merchandise as well.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, economic  growth will be challenged by waning government support and lingering  supply and labor constraints. At the same time, the rapidly spreading  delta variant of Covid-19 present risks to the spending outlook.</p>\n\n<p>More stories like this are available on <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/\">bloomberg.com</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/67obqkd5zdp5lj8/?utm_source=yahoo_usn\">Subscribe now</a> to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.</p>\n\n<p>©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/otx4g6/us_gdp_65_trails_forecast_84_even_as_consumer/","title":"U.S. GDP (6.5%) Trails Forecast (8.4%) Even as Consumer Spending Surges","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-30T13:05:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-30 13:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d4669472-2663-5ed9-beba-eedac21b313d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/otx4g6/us_gdp_65_trails_forecast_84_even_as_consumer/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/otx4g6/us_gdp_65_trails_forecast_84_even_as_consumer/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"abdul10000","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/abdul10000","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"abdul10000","score":36,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"米国のGDP（6.5％）は、個人消費が増加しても予想（8.4％）を下回る","the_new_excerpt":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gdp-trails-forecast-even-123834932.html\n\n\n米国のGDP、個人消費が伸びても予想を下回る\n\n(Bloomberg) -- 米国の第2四半期の成長率は予測を下回りました。\n第2四半期の米国の成長率は、サプライチェーンの制約による影響が経済全体に波及したため、予測を下回りました。\n予測を下回る結果となりました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国GDP（6.5%）落后于预测（8.4%），即使消费者支出激增","the_new_excerpt":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gdp-trails-forecast-even-123834932.html\n\n\n即使消费支出激增，美国GDP仍低于预期\n\n(Bloomberg) -- 美国第二季度的经济增长没有达到预期，因为供应链限制的影响在经济中回荡，使美国的经济增长失去了光彩。\n供应链限制的影响在经济中回荡，并使其失去了光彩。\n的影响。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國GDP（6.5%）落後於預測（8.4%），即使消費者支出激增","the_new_excerpt":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gdp-trails-forecast-even-123834932.html\n\n\n即使消費支出激增，美國GDP仍低於預期\n\n(Bloomberg) -- 美國第二季度的經濟增長沒有達到預期，因爲供應鏈限制的影響在經濟中迴盪，使美國的經濟增長失去了光彩。\n供應鏈限制的影響在經濟中迴盪，並使其失去了光彩。\n的影響。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6caef82b-aa71-5a79-b793-4f417b28c765","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ouihbi/charles_schwab_uk_boss_fomo_and_hodl_are_not/","title":"Charles Schwab UK boss: 'FOMO and HODL are not investment strategies'","date":"July 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"チャールズ・シュワブUKのボス：「FOMOとHODLは投資戦略ではない」。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"查尔斯-施瓦布英国老板：\"FOMO和HODL不是投资策略","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"查爾斯-施瓦布英國老闆：\"FOMO和HODL不是投資策略","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1420918305284632581","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1420918305284632581","title":"NYC IS BACK!\n https://t.co/OfbaIAgDWU","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 30, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"NYC IS BACK!\n https://t.co/OfbaIAgDWU","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"纽约市回来了!\n https://t.co/OfbaIAgDWU","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"紐約市回來了!\n https://t.co/OfbaIAgDWU","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-d4669472-2663-5ed9-beba-eedac21b313d","previousId":"RedditPost-6caef82b-aa71-5a79-b793-4f417b28c765","nextId":"TweetPost-1420918305284632581","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/otx4g6/us_gdp_65_trails_forecast_84_even_as_consumer/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
