I decided to take a quick look at the company.  Their Vehicle is... not very impressive, no groundbreaking range, efficiency or price improvements.  Their big selling point is solar cells plastered all over the vehicle, which many companies are exploring.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about the company here:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonomotors.com/&quot;&gt;https://sonomotors.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, who exactly is building these cars?  Surely a startup this size can&amp;#39;t mass produce $30,000 vehicles.  The answer is National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS).  They bought SAAB&amp;#39;s assets in 2012 with the intent to make a SAAB 9-3 EV.  In almost a decade, no vehicle has made it to production.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets worse.  NEVS is a subsidiary of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, A subsidiary of Evergrande Health Industry Group, who bought 100% of NEVS in 2020.  Evergrande Health is, of course, a subsidiary Evergrande Group.  Also of note, NEVS haven&amp;#39;t filed any reports since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEVS ownership structure and investor relations:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nevs.com/en/investors/owner-structure/&quot;&gt;https://www.nevs.com/en/investors/owner-structure/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This  company has managed to put their manufacturing into the hands of, ostensibly, an incompetent and unproven manufacturer, which is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Evergrande Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If ever there were an EV stock to avoid... this would be it.&lt;/p&gt;

But ended up buying a SPY Tech ETF. When I looked back I saw that SONY at times actually outpferforms Microsoft and that for close to 10 years. Granted they were beaten to the ground prior in 2010 but how their last CEO turned that business around in pretty much all areas is a masterwork. When I did more research I found out that an important factor to their success was their CFO at that time, who has become their current new CEO in just 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was mostly interested in their Playtation devision because I see how far ahead they are in storytelling and grahpics compared to other AAA developers and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I actually like each divison they are in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Television/Pictures: they dont have a big streaming service but they produce like 2 or 3 of Netflix biggest hits (The Crown, Bridgerton, Cobra Kai, Better call Saul) and they did Breaking Bad. I feel their television arm is morphing more and more into another HBO quality wise. I expect Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Disney to lit. fight for this content in future and Sony television can easy profit. And well Spiderman: Now way Home is a Sony movie afterall and breaking records for that franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music: Sony Music is the 2nd largest Music label in the world and they are not stopping growing. Again they dont own a streaming service, but they make equal good money by licensing and with the closer becoming fan interaction of artists and their fans --maybe in VR-- (where Sony is also big into btw.) I can see them going a more direct way to present live conerts etc. skipping Spotify, Youtube etc. They already partnered up with one of the big 3 kpop labels to get as one of the first big music labels exposure to that lucrative market, so they are in the Zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronics/Sensing/Imaging: I see mostly growth in Sensing and imaging technology for the EV market(cars and other vehicles). Electronics I dont think is too hot at the moment but I see their TVs and Smartphone being in the premium segment now where margin is better. Its already worth it to have that direct 2 consumer relationship imo and they can build up from here with VR and AR devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming: With Tencent is Sony the best and fastest growing Gaming company imo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are quite heavily advancing with their Playstation Studios portfolio aquiring left and right and increasing their existing studio size. I am not into the metaverse talk, but when Playtation would want to one Im sure they could. They talk how they want more exposure to 1st party big multiplayer titles, whereas last generation they mostly concentrated their efforts to deliver big quality singe player games. Mulitplayer brings more profit, so thats bullish. They are also devloping Playstation VR2 for release in 2022, which would for example let you play also any non VR game with rudimentary VR support. With all the metaverse (bullshit)talk I can see that reveal create kinda a buzz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also own Sony Bank, one of the biggest japanese digital banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thats about their current divisions. In the coming years, they plan to enter semi business in corporation with TSMC and build up a new core business pillar for them as they call it: Anime. They now own the biggest box office anime hit in history with Demon Salyer. That IP is so big, it generated 8 BILLION USD in revenue (&lt;a href=&quot;https://animesweet.com/anime/demon-slayer-the-series-unstoppable-success-topped-8-billion/&quot;&gt;https://animesweet.com/anime/demon-slayer-the-series-unstoppable-success-topped-8-billion/&lt;/a&gt;).  Granted, across different companies and with Merch, (mobile/console)games etc. but when they can create one such anime hit, they have the chance for another. Netflix for example produces --while quality anime content-- but not one of that caliber of Demon Salyer. With Sony having much closer ties to many japanese anime studios I can see them creating the defacto streaming service and having a chance for that next One Piece killer. Merch is brining in the money, not the movies itself. They already own Funimation and Crunchyroll and are currently working on combining them...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YTD performance: 36%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Cap: 154B&lt;/p&gt;

The bank said many factors behind surging consumer prices were “beyond monetary policy’s control” and that it would “consider” ending its cycle of rate cuts this December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the decision Turkey’s lira plummeted about 4%, hitting 11 against the US dollar for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a political move by Erdogan? I do not have a great understanding of Turkish politics, however, Erdogan does not seem to be well liked by Turkish people I know and this decision seems irrational. Erdogan apparently holds the view that high interest causes inflation rather than tame it. Where else has this type of thinking been seen? Is it that common at all? This is the first time I have seen that opinion on interest rates and inflation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When a stock goes up on a series of strong and better than expected results, few probing questions are ever asked as the outperformance is usually a confirmation of an investment thesis,” MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson wrote Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, he argues that investors may have been too upbeat about the extent that Roku’s ROKU, -11.34% advertising performance helped drive its results while understating the impact of new streaming launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathanson cut his rating on Roku’s stock to sell from neutral, while lowering his price target to $220 from $330. “Simply put, we think our and the Street’s long-term revenue and earnings estimates are just too damn high,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By his math, “it appears that Roku will need to monetize an absurdly high portion of long-tail AVOD [ad-based video-on-demand] impressions to come even close to Street numbers, which we think willbe a challenge given rising competitive pressures in TV OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and operating systems,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roku’s stock sank 9.8% in morning trading, putting them on track to suffer the biggest one-day selloff in a year, and to close at a one-year low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathanson believes Roku has “especially benefited from the launch of new DTC [direct-to-consumer] services over the past year,” but he worries about how that momentum will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The amount of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations from content distribution agreements has notably increased since 2Q 2020, but we believe these performance obligations should begin to moderate,” as Roku continues to lap the launches of new streaming services, Nathanson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Nathanson’s estimations, Roku added about $79 million in new performance obligations during the third quarter, “whether from new distribution agreements or revaluation of existing agreements.” That amount is “meaningfully lower than the estimated $450+ million added each in 1Q 2021 and 2Q 2021,” he wrote, which he sees as reflective of a “potential slowdown” in streaming purchases and promotional spending on Roku’s service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 28 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Roku’s stock, 21 have buy ratings, four have hold ratings, and three have sell ratings, with an average price target of $387.96.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Roku, which are headed for the lowest close since Nov. 18, 2020, are up 5.2% over the past 12 months, but have lost 30% over the past three months. The S&amp;amp;P 500 index SPX, -0.26% has rallied 30.0% over a 12-month span and gained 5.5% over a three-month span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how Alibaba did in its fiscal second-quarter, versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue: 200.69 billion yuan ($31.4 billion) vs. 204.93 billion yuan estimated, a 29% year-on-year rise.&lt;br/&gt;
EPS: 11.20 yuan vs. 12.36 yuan estimated, a 38% year-on-year decline.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba has been a victim of China’s crackdown on its domestic technology industry which has seen a slew of new regulation brought in from antitrust to data protection.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s tech giants have grown largely unencumbered over the past few years, Beijing has looked to clean up some of the behaviors of its corporates. Alibaba was fined $2.8 billion in April as part of an anti-monopoly probe.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China’s economy slowed down in the third quarter of the year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations were low coming into the fiscal second-quarter earnings report as a result, with analysts expecting it to be one of the most challenging quarters ever for the Chinese e-commerce giant.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is coming off the back of Singles Day, a huge shopping event in China where e-commerce platforms push heavy discounts and rack up billions of dollars of sales.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba raked in gross merchandise volume during the 11-day period totaling 540.3 billion yuan ($84.54 billion). Any revenue Alibaba gets from this event will not be reflected in the September quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

Take advantage of that. Long term potential, and big catalyst early December. Make money with the bunny. Beware: Lots of execution risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an ancient saying, probably: Can&amp;#39;t go tits up investing in tits out. Since the dawn of humankind, men have been willing to shell out their hard earned money in order to suspend all disbelief that, despite the reality that they are disgusting and utterly replaceable blobs of flesh engineered strictly to carry and disperse sperm, they are sexually desirable and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playboy made its name exploiting this innate male desire and also made it culturally acceptable -- they somehow convinced people that this practice of shooting swimmers all over the planet is not morally bankrupt, not entirely meaningless and pointless, but rather: it is an &lt;em&gt;aspiration&lt;/em&gt; for both men and women to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the dismay of the sock industry Playboy also invented a second, rather high margin, use for glossy paper. By printing images of naked women (likely also seeking the feeling of sexual desirability and relevance) on those pages, Playboy was able to sell those glossy sheets of paper for an incredible mark up... every month. They were also able to build one of the world&amp;#39;s most recognizable brands. (It&amp;#39;s estimated that the brand has 97% recall. Try to name any other brand with that kind of branding valued below $2b)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/4yop9ww188081.jpg?width=1136&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c89c24a3a378e34a53309c2f1342860b2e2de41&quot;&gt;From the interview within: \&amp;quot;I think any man enjoys flirtations, and if he said he didn’t, he’d be lying or he’d be a politician trying to get the extra four votes. I think everybody likes knowing he’s well responded to.\&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the times changed, and so did the time honored tradition of rubbing a quick one out between some pages and hastily disposing of the evidence. Though Viagra was able to extend and harden the founder&amp;#39;s penis, it did not, unfortunately, have a similar effect on the business. First VHS, then the internet. Before too long, sock companies were once again rejoicing as hoards of mongers fixed their eyes to screens and their hands to computer peripherals and footwear. At least we&amp;#39;re saving some trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the popularity of Playboy faded, management tried a few retarded last ditch efforts to pep up their brand, including removing the cartoons, ending full frontal nudity, and ditching the slogan &amp;quot;Entertainment for Men&amp;quot;. It was, unsurprisingly, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playboy&amp;#39;s last physical print was February 2016, and by Hugh Hefner&amp;#39;s death in late 2017, Playboy was basically a limp dick -- left to decay as dying publishing business with no vision behind it, leaving behind only an iconic logo, brand, and story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. The new Playboy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playboy was taken private in 2010, only to resurface publicly as a SPAC earlier this year. At the helm, CEO Ben Kohn has put a significant amount of work and thought into reviving and positioning the business to fit into today&amp;#39;s world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t get into the details of the acquisitions and pivots PLBY has made since Ben took the helm and PLBY went public. Basically, it&amp;#39;s been a year-long revamp. The main theme of the new PLBY is to focus on high-margin direct-to-consumer ecommerce, with the recent reveal of Centerfold tying it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t0jb1z2388081.png?width=1023&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b57916204f31e0b9666548515be80c0b0d396e39&quot;&gt;Pieces set in place... and beast Centerfold on the way.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summary of the pieces they&amp;#39;ve collected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Licensing: leveraging the brand to collect easy tendies. Improving licensing deals is basically free money, and they&amp;#39;re making progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playboy.com: High margin DTC ecommerce. It&amp;#39;s clear from sales data it&amp;#39;s not boomer-centered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yandy &amp;amp; Lovers: Sexual Wellness products. Ideally, Centerfold will drive even more revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honey Birdette: High quality, high margin lingerie and swimwear. Also important: talent and logistics. Think designers and supply chain capabilities. Rather than outsourcing design and manufacturing of clothes, PLBY can keep the margin to themselves. Ideally, they&amp;#39;ll be selling a lot of this stuff as they drive customers to it from Centerfold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NFTs: A team that&amp;#39;s proven the ability to launch NFTs and print money. Several successful projects under their belt at this point. NFT transfers provide recurring revenue via OpenSea&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;royalty&amp;quot; system. Eg, each time an NFT is traded, PLBY gets 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centerfold: They acquired &amp;quot;Dream.me&amp;quot; in Oct, which provides the technology and talent of which Centerfold will be built on. The team was acquired in nearly all stock, so their interests are aligned: build a kick ass platform and profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLBY has its fingers in a lot of pies, but what stands out to me is how everything will fit together with Centerfold. &lt;strong&gt;Centerfold will be Playboy&amp;#39;s creator platform.&lt;/strong&gt; Think Patreon, or OnlyFans... &lt;strong&gt;except not only is there massive revenue potential in and of itself, there is the potential to drive revenue through all the other channels set in place.&lt;/strong&gt; Centerfold was announced September, with a launch date of Q2 2022... but on Oct 21 was advanced to Q4 2021, and in Q3 earnings call to &amp;quot;early December&amp;quot;. More on the Centerfold story later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Q3 Inflection Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not an easy task to take a dying publishing company with a fading image and come up with a cohesive strategy to revive it, and it&amp;#39;s even harder to communicate that strategy to the market... especially in such a murky industry. If you read through the various statements of what PLBY is and its direction, you&amp;#39;ll find a lot of major (and minor) pivots along the way in the past year or two. &lt;strong&gt;However, for me, Q3 marks the point at which all the pieces are set and the real execution begins in earnest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by &amp;quot;inflection point&amp;quot; here is that the strategy is solidifying, and is showing early signs of working. The Q3 call has provided the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the direction PLBY has settled on: high-margin goods, DTC, Licensing, NFTs, and Centerfold tying it all together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how the company plans to leverage their brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;revenues are growing, even without Centerfold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centerfold is indeed going to happen, and the launch of it seems promising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the strategy has been set, is showing signs of working. &lt;strong&gt;PLBY is clearly transitioning from a shell of a brand into a business that will print.&lt;/strong&gt; Centerfold will kick this all into high gear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And then when you couple that with CENTERFOLD, and how this flywheel all works together. CENTERFOLD is not only an unbelievably lucrative financial opportunity for the company. It also provides an ongoing relationship with the talent that we have worked with for 70 plus years. We also have access now to all of those subscribers on the CENTERFOLD platform that will benefit not only the Playboy membership, but also our commerce efforts as well. And so, all of this sort of comes together in this cohesive ecosystem or flywheel. I&amp;#39;m really excited by the potential for what we can deliver moving forward on a recurring revenue basis.&amp;quot; - Ben Kohn, CEO, Q3 earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, I also think that the messaging and marketing to investors has reached an inflection point as well. Starting now, when investors ask &amp;quot;what the fuck is PLBY and why should I care&amp;quot;, a clear picture can be messaged. It&amp;#39;s shifting from &amp;quot;a once-dying publishing business that is now a sexual wellness lifestyle brand, brough public via SPAC&amp;quot; -- it&amp;#39;s more like a real business with clear strategy that can print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the picture above, it&amp;#39;s clear that Centerfold is the meat of the sandwich, so let&amp;#39;s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2. CENTERFOLD vs OnlyFans&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fn9vs5b488081.png?width=1018&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=443883caa4eba6904ea439895730ee94575ae247&quot;&gt;OnlyFans felt like destroying their reputation. They&amp;#39;ve since reversed this, but the damage has been done.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s incredible to me that I hadn&amp;#39;t heard about Centerfold until a few weeks ago. In fact, that&amp;#39;s what got me started down this rabbit hole: A publicly listed company is going to create an OnlyFans competitor? How the fuck have I not heard of this? &lt;strong&gt;I think the potential of Centerfold is barely priced in to PLBY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You probably heard about OnlyFans&amp;#39; ban on sexual content... but did you hear about Centerfold? That&amp;#39;s about how priced in this is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publicity for the stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability for market to gain exposure to a thriving industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massive amount of recurring tendies, which the market loves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue that could easily eclipse the rest of PLBY&amp;#39;s portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting Playboy back into the zeitgeist and ushering in the next generation of cultural relevance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memeability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dig a little deeper, and you&amp;#39;ll find the timing could not possibly be better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OnlyFans fucked up in August by announcing a ban on sexual content (they reverted this days later). Massive reputational damage, and fears payment processing might be rug pulled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The revelation that the OnlyFans owner is a piece of shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stories about how OnlyFans does not vet creators properly, allowing a 14yo on the platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content creators want to ditch OnlyFans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultural push towards female empowerment and entrepreneurship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you think of a better company to do this than Playboy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retarded market offering crazy valuations for anything remotely technology or WFH based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch date pushed up to early December&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the content creation business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the first thing you retards are going to think is &amp;quot;durr... Mixer couldn&amp;#39;t get market share from Twitch... so Centerfold gonna fail too!!&amp;quot; Ok, fuckheads, try to wrap your head around this: &lt;strong&gt;There are major differences between the Twitch/Mixer business and the OnlyFans/Centerfold business&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, they both involve content creators and viewers. Yes, they both take a cut of subscriptions. But use your fucking wrinkles and you&amp;#39;ll see some key differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s a reason that &amp;quot;hey whats your OF&amp;quot; is a meme, and &amp;quot;hey whats your twitch&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitch/Mixer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What creators want: exposure to as wide an audience as possible. More viewers = more ad revenue, subscriptions, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What viewers want: a wide array of content. Discoverability. Time wasting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network effect: &lt;strong&gt;MASSIVE&lt;/strong&gt;. More creators = more audience. More audience = more creators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure: basically like a TV with various channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: audience draws in creators, creators draw in more viewers, a virtuous cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OnlyFans/Centerfold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What creators want: a platform to handle the hosting and monetization of their content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What viewers want: a place to &amp;quot;consume content&amp;quot; of very particular creator(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network effect: &lt;strong&gt;LOW&lt;/strong&gt;.  Subscriptions are driven by creators hustling their OF link. Discoverability is not required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure: basically separate &amp;quot;blogs&amp;quot; for each content creator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: creators draw in their own audience, eg: &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s your OF link?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: Twitch/Mixer business relies on both viewers and content creators joining their platform -- the more of each, the better. Massive network effect, massive moat for Twitch. &lt;strong&gt;OnlyFans/Centerfold relies, almost soley, on content creators joining their platform.&lt;/strong&gt; This is all made evident by how the sites are structured (channels vs blogs), and how they are used (think of how you&amp;#39;d find a twitch streamer vs how you&amp;#39;d find an OF creator).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How PLBY steals market share from OnlyFans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question is: &lt;strong&gt;if you were a content creator trying to sell your feet pics, how do you choose which platform to use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reputation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d probably want to choose a platform that will pay you, that will allow your content, and that is not owned by a scumbag. Let&amp;#39;s compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OnlyFans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In August, said they were having trouble raising money and with payment processing. As a result, &lt;strong&gt;said they would no longer allow sexual content, effective within weeks&lt;/strong&gt;. (They reversed this decision days later.) Imagine having all of your revenue suddenly pulled out from under you. Well, first imagine you made money to begin with. &lt;strong&gt;Massive, irrecoverable reputation damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founder is a shithead. He made his money creating websites that would claim to have links to pedophilia and bestiality. Thankfully, it was a scam: those links went to legit porn sites and produced affiliate revenue. Imagine a person that the world is thankful is a scammer. That&amp;#39;s this guy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowed under-18s on the platform. Google it. Not a good look, not investable, either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, for better or worse, a somewhat trashy reputation to say you&amp;#39;re on OnlyFans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playboy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decades long reputation of free speech, sex positivity, and sophistication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publicly traded revenue generating company; high confidence they will keep paying your bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much shame in saying you were a playmate. Lots of bunny tattoos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short... would you rather tattoo your ankle with an OnlyFans logo, or a Playboy bunny logo? And which company would you trust to pay you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Economics and the 80/20 rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are countless creators on OnlyFans, the vast majority of revenue comes from a tiny minority of creators. PLBY just needs to win those creators over. It&amp;#39;s not as monstrous of a task as you might think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;More than 300 OnlyFans creators reportedly earn at least $1 million annually, while 16,000 creators make at least $50,000 a year.&amp;quot; -CNBC article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLBY can offer creators more revenue, and more revenue streams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer a higher rev share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow creators to sell merchandise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow creators to sell NFTs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. CENTERFOLD vs Instagram&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t7ya5hz588081.png?width=946&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0c7c3392c43b7d2ca4a3ddd6be784c0f18b5d6de&quot;&gt;Instagram is not a fan of tits and will slam the banhammer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to Centerfold, less talked about is how it can function as a nudity friendly version of Instagram, and the potential there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram has a pretty strict content policy, and models are finding their accounts randomly get deleted due to TOS violations. Tens to hundreds of thousands of followers can vanish in an instant. Tumblr is gone, too -- so where&amp;#39;s a girl to go to post her new fake tits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is huge potential in a nudity friendly Instagram clone.&lt;/strong&gt; Playboy&amp;#39;s motto? &amp;quot;nudity is normal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playboy won&amp;#39;t have to rely on ads to generate revenue from Centerfold -- they can simply drive traffic to their existing assets. Lingerie. Sex toys. Centerfold subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy win, here, and if you go around reading DDs about PLBY and Centerfold, you&amp;#39;ll find it overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. Centerfold Launch Progress&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centerfold was initially announced in September, shortly after OnlyFans made their retarded announcement that they would not allow sexual content. The initial launch date was planned for Q2 2022. Google &amp;quot;playboy centerfold medium&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Oct 21, Centerfold announced the acquisition of Dream.me, a creator-driven/social media platform. Basically, a clone of Instagram. This acquisition was in all stock, and provided a skeleton for the platform, but more importantly a strongly incentivized team willing to bust their ass to get this thing out there. Launch date was move up to Q4 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the stock has been marching upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q3 earnings, as hoped, provided some guidance on how things are going with Centerfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In general, the platform is in place and we think what we have assembled today is truly a competitive differentiator moving forward as we think about membership and CENTERFOLD. What we can offer the creative community is something that no one else can offer. And I think that&amp;#39;s referenced by the founding creators that we have signed up to launch with that represent in excess of 300 million social media followers.&amp;quot; - Q3 earnings call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there&amp;#39;s this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Founding creators on CENTERFOLD will bring in ~300 million social media followers, and hundreds of millions in existing GMV&amp;quot; -whossayn on theideafund&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this, in response to &amp;quot;And one super quick follow up for these early CENTERFOLD launch partners, what kinds of creators are in there?&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So they are huge music stars, to former playmates, to adult stars, to artists, to other influencers, actors, celebrities. It&amp;#39;s really -- we&amp;#39;ve really been overwhelmed by the response from the creator community, and also by the diversity of the creators that we brought in. And I think it&amp;#39;s going to truly be something that&amp;#39;s unique&amp;quot; -Ben Kohn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;5. NFTs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ni0dz7l788081.png?width=294&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5e06ef1abd961abf6630b7621443b13ea27d0dcd&quot;&gt; \&amp;quot;Rabbitar\&amp;quot; NFTs will grant special membership and perks to various things. What, exactly, is TBA.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t personally give a shit about NFTs, but PLBY is interesting in this regard. I&amp;#39;ll keep this brief:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their run up to $60 was due to an NFT they launched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#39;ve since launched a much larger, and more interesting NFT series: Rabbitars. Sold out quickly, produced $9M in revenue, and will produce recurring revenue (10% on each transfer). No run up this time, though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rabbitar NFT will have an IRL use: it&amp;#39;s planned to serve as &amp;quot;membership&amp;quot; to various Playboy/Centerfold things. Perks, discounts, live events... a lot of possibilities here, especially if each Rabbitar has different perks. AFAIK, no other public company has tied NFTs to real life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;6. Additional considerations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think PLBY has reach anywhere near its peak in terms of potential market interest, both retail and institutional. It has a lot of solid followers and believers of the stock, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GME O.G. and banana aficionado &lt;a href=&quot;/u/uberkikz11&quot;&gt;/u/uberkikz11&lt;/a&gt; is quite vocally bullish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google &amp;quot;hedgeye PLBY&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just google the damn ticker and do some DD for yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PLBY might represent the best ticker in the market to invest in men jerking off and women whoring themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;7. ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ THE BEAR CASES ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to understand Centerfold is not a sure fire thing. There is &lt;strong&gt;considerable execution risk&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;#39;ll lay out what I think are the big &amp;quot;ifs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flaccid launch&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;#39;s possible Centerfold, when launched, just sucks. It can come off as a shitty clone of Instagram or OnlyFans, and the market&amp;#39;s confidence can be shaken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed launch&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;#39;s a tech product, and subject to feature creep, bugs, etc. The deadline is extremely aggressive, and it&amp;#39;s possible it gets pushed back. However, guidance on release was given days ago, so it&amp;#39;s likely. But, still possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure concerns&lt;/strong&gt;: investability / payment processor / etc. Despite what you might think, PLBY has a strong E.S.G. vibe to it, so I think it should be OK. They are &amp;gt;50% female employees (I think), and for better or worse, they&amp;#39;re very vocally woke. I think Ben Kohn does a great job walking the line between investable and &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Policies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest risks, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shitty creators&lt;/strong&gt;: Though the pool of initial creators has been talked up by management, but not defined.  It&amp;#39;s possible they actually suck. Imagine a line-up of &amp;quot;unconventional beauty&amp;quot;. Eg, &amp;quot;body positive&amp;quot; woke bullshit that is attempted to be marketed as the new wave of sexual wellness. While this is possible, I think it&amp;#39;s unlikely. Ben Kohn knows what&amp;#39;s up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content policy&lt;/strong&gt;. On a recent interview on FOX, where the host was an asshole, Ben Kohn stated there will be no &amp;quot;porn&amp;quot;.. or orgies on their airplane. However, the term &amp;quot;porn&amp;quot; was never defined... and he was talking with FOX, so he had to be careful what he said. In my opinion, if they allow nudity but no masturbation, that could be bad. If there&amp;#39;s no scat, probably less of a concern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m somewhat worried about these given the amount of woke-speak of this company, but I&amp;#39;m confident management knows where the dollars are:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/skj0dm4988081.png?width=1353&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dd4cabddc5d8399212e098288ab8e8399a68e93c&quot;&gt;Content policy is up in the air. Requires faith.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each notch up on the &amp;quot;debauchery&amp;quot; scale of porn likely captures less and less revenue. For fun, that scale might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See through clothes, costumes, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontal Nudity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pussy close-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light bondage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sucking on dildos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insertion of dildos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Butthole stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penises inside of things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggressive BDSM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of cum all over and inside of various things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pee-pee and poo-poo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know. Feel free to comment!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk is they land somewhere too low on the scale to capture significant revenue and interest from OnlyFans-esque creators. Again, I trust their judgement... but I&amp;#39;d feel much more comfortable knowing the exact policy before launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, there&amp;#39;s likely an 80/20 rule here. Going up the the scale will uncapture less and less revenue. So, even if they go pretty light, there&amp;#39;s plenty of opportunity. And, it should be noted that even if they go very light, the Centerfold vs. Instagram thesis would still hold quite strong. Creators need a home to post nudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Insider Selling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last one you might have heard about if you follow the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people made a big deal about a recent filing where the CEO and other insiders were granted a bunch of shares to sell. Rumors went flying that a ton of shares were about to get sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s my understanding this is a nothingburger and par for the course. Yes, they got their shares... per their employment agreements or whatever. No, there is nothing there that is saying they will sell.  They &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; sell, but management has been clear they are in this for the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;8. Technicals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Historical IV&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rl85o1ca88081.png?width=706&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=95310a4d17798ac12f268f3947529968bace9ff3&quot;&gt;IV far lower than it was due to NFTs, despite PLBY having more catalysts right now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given an advertised massive catalyst coming in early December, the IV30 sits at around 95%. I believe this is a massive mispricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Price Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/csr85xqb88081.png?width=1817&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c3099ef24563c813f6405421dbf46fca09104990&quot;&gt;Annotated events of interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s summary of price action this year. Notice the creep up after Centerfold was announced. I personally think this is bullish and the start of an upwards channel as we approach early December, but what the fuck do I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gamma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/76uf800d88081.png?width=1194&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b661e18dac8583348a92644e0a3e0c0aaf084f9b&quot;&gt;Modest gamma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamma on this one is nothing too crazy, though as a percentage of daily volume it is significant. A rush into options would likely push the price up somewhat, but I doubt a squeeze is in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;9. Positions and Price Target&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Positions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/36zeksle88081.png?width=643&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ad0d3855d682b58c9a264248afbcdc888fb3b296&quot;&gt;Shares and calls. This is the way.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000 x Shares: Safest bet. I&amp;#39;m happy locking these away and looking at them a year from now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 x Jan $35 calls: Anticipating a run up towards Centerfold launch (early December), giving a little extra time for bumps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80 x Jan $40 calls: More aggressive, and hoping to capture some IV gain here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Targets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m selling if IV30 runs above 200. Not worth that much risk. I&amp;#39;m trimming at $50, much more aggressively at $60, and out if hits $70. This is my personal preference, based on my personal risk tolerance and what I hope to gain, and is not investment advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Other Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the bear case, please. And do your own DD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;10. TLDR: 🍆💦 = 🐰🚀&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLBY has loaded a lot of fuel into a rocket. OnlyFans, by being fuck-ups, also contributed some fuel to the rocket. So has Instagram. When Centerfold launches, PLBY will be igniting that rocket. If you are unaware of the company turnaround, and that Centerfold is launching soon, then it is likely not yet priced in. Despite all this... IV30 sits at 94%. I like the stock, and I&amp;#39;m jacked to the tits with shares and Jan $35 and $40. Also, afaik, so is the GME banana guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there&amp;#39;s a ton of people with a lot of money (in my mind, this group that people vaguely allude to all of the time as pent up money on the sidelines has to be typically families making $250k/yr+, no?) chasing returns. There&amp;#39;s nowhere else to park money, I get it. I&amp;#39;m just asking... when is that going to stop being the answer? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When are people going to run out of cash to deploy? How many people are really buying in at these levels weekly with any sizable volume? I get it, everybody here is dollar-cost-averaging $500/mo into their 401k irregardless and they want a badge of honor on how they ignore the market and are sticking to their great 30 year long investment plan. Amazing. Congratulations. My question is... is that&amp;#39;s what is driving the market up 40% in 14 months? Regular John Smith&amp;#39;s 401k on his $120k/yr salary? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought on a good year, when earnings beat estimates and forecasts were positive and not revised downward, we could reliably expect companies to grow so much that overall the market averages 10% of growth before inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the heck are we up 39% from August 2020 to now? Are the 505 companies inside of the S&amp;amp;P 39% more profitable/forward looking than they were then? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money the Fed printed for stimulus + CoVID relief... has it left the &amp;quot;banking&amp;quot; system? It went fed -&amp;gt; banks. Are the banks lending it out? If not... I know that money &amp;quot;exists&amp;quot; on paper but... is it really in circulation? Who got it and who spent it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s think logically: How can general motors stock be 90b and Tesla&amp;#39;s stock be 1T. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say they eventually sell as many cars as Toyota (400b Market cap), their current valuation is still 2x this, and they aren&amp;#39;t even close to Toyota&amp;#39;s production level and probably won&amp;#39;t be for the next 5+ years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toyota&amp;#39;s production for 2021: 10 million cars &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s production for 2021: 627,350&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means Toyota will produce 16x more cars this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is: 
If you were me would you dump Tesla stock?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Toyota will make 16x more cars this year, but its market cap is only 40% of Tesla&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit/Additional Note: I feel like many people are not considering the fact that all major vehicle companies will eventually adapt to fully electric vehicles on par with Telsa. Some car companies may go broke and be replaced with new EV based companies, however the big dogs like Toyota and GM will eventually catch up to Tesla. This is basic common sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telsa, Nio, and Rivian are first movers but they dont have as big of a moat as people think.&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, what’s a polite way to tell these “geniuses” that they they’re not as smart as they think they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterday’s US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some key numbers for today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple (AAPL): +1.75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target (TGT): -4.73%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core Retail Sales: +1.6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing Production: +1.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Wieting, Citigroup’s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, “The markets generally are looking at it [the pace of inflation], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct – it’s benign for markets. It doesn’t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Target (TGT) and Lowe’s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target (TGT)&lt;/strong&gt;: “With a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,&amp;quot; said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowe’s (LOW):&lt;/strong&gt; “Our momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management”, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The party seems over… after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I’d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CME Group (CME) the world&amp;#39;s largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity&quot;&gt;https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company&amp;#39;s Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic I got married and moved to a new city so I really kinda forgot about my investments until my husband said he wanted to start investing too, but was wary about doing so because he didn&amp;#39;t know what the right timing was. Because of this place, I was able to explain to him why it&amp;#39;s time IN the market not timing the market, and help him understand investment language, set up his account, and choose his portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

But it&amp;#39;s just gotten to a point where it doesn&amp;#39;t make responsible sense for me to keep it anymore in hopes of another price surge up to $60 and beyond, when the last few months&amp;#39; price surges only go up ~$40 and I&amp;#39;m sitting on ~14x and have real life bills to pay, including a major medical bill. So, I bit today&amp;#39;s price surge past $40 and sold, I know it was the responsible thing to do - but damn this hurts. Really wanted to be a part of the next a-p-e nation win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: so i posted here bc i figured the other forums would hate on me for selling.  I know this was the responsible thing to do, but it would&amp;#39;ve been nice to hang in there with the rest of a-p-e nation - but don&amp;#39;t have the extra $$ to be doing that right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit 2: want to add, despite my decision to sell, i think this whole memestock phenomenon is so cool and when i&amp;#39;m old with grandkids, it&amp;#39;ll be cool to look back and say that I was a part of it even for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford owns 102 million shares (it should sell them sharpish at this price) worth an incredible $17.5 billion in Rivian that has sold a couple of hundred cars to employees to date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not absurd at all. I mean Rivian had a massive 13,000 orders at end of 3Q (giggle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously wonder how many Rivian investors know that Ford has a massive stake.  I hope it sells it very soon as a Ford shareholder.  Those funds can quickly be put to use massively outselling Rivian in BEV&amp;#39;s by even larger multiples in 2022, 2023, 2024....(basically forever).&lt;/p&gt;

With shares hovering around record highs, it will take a blockbuster report to move the needle for investors. Nvidia stock rose 0.6% to $302.03 in Tuesday trading. Shares surged earlier this month as investors bought in on hype surrounding Nvidia’s financial prospects amid billions in investment, most notably from Facebook ‘s newly rebranded parent Meta Platforms (FB), to build a theorized next phase of the internet called the metaverse. Not even renewed scrutiny in the U.K. related to its proposed acquisition of chip designer Arm could stop the graphics card stock’s 131% year-to-date run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter, analysts polled by FactSet forecast adjusted earnings of $1.11 a share and sales of $6.82 billion. The earnings report or outlook may need to be a blowout for the stock to continue rising. Though 34 of the 43 analysts listed by FactSet have Buy or equivalent ratings, the stock’s mean price target is $280.70. Bullish analysts will either need to raise their targets or downgrade the stock if shares hold above their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

This rumor started because Canoo moved its headquarter to Bentonville, the home of Walmart headquarters. Canoo also teased during its earnings call that it will be building some prototypes for an unnamed partner, which of course the internet jumped on the idea that it must be Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little skeptical of this, since Walmart already has other car partners like Ford and Gatik. Does it make sense to add Canoo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thesis is that Canoo is a decent speculative stock even if it doesn&amp;#39;t have this Walmart deal. There&amp;#39;s lots of other tailwinds such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The infrastructure bill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canoo fills a niche that&amp;#39;s not directly competitive against Rivian or Tesla (and definitely not Lucid). For example Canoo would be great for local governments and schools which will be forced to go green and would like vehicles with low maintenance costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is hungry for EV stock right now. And at sub $20 this is something people can feel good throwing a few bucks in and hold for years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worried that Canoo doesn&amp;#39;t manufacture it&amp;#39;s own vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canoo already had one hyped up story with the acquisition talks with Apple. If this Walmart thing go south investors will &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hate Canoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible discussion topics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; possible reasons to move to Bentonville? Perhaps that city offer huge incentives not seen elsewhere, or maybe it&amp;#39;s actually a great hub of manufacturing. Anyone in that area know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does Canoo stack up against other EV &amp;quot;hype&amp;quot; stocks right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I bought some Canoo this morning, and I kinda like their aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something here? I used to be an avid gamer myself. But my current age I dont have the mental or physical will power to play a game when I get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just tired as hell. Its been a drag for my significant other, since we were both avid gamers together.  But its just the reality.. I&amp;#39;m way too tired to play anything on the weekends. Luckily, I just spectate whatever she&amp;#39;s playing and I guess I get my gaming fix there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question remains though. I know my anecdotal experience isnt going to be very useful but I&amp;#39;m just wondering how everybody else feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the FB meta video, all +1 hour of it, and I just thought.. wow. Who would want to be logged into a video game with that shit on your face for multiple hours??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just me? Am I just an old fart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also vaguely reminds me of the 3d movies phase as well. Everybody thought we&amp;#39;d be lining up to see these 3d movies forever but people quickly got tired of that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEY POINTS&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon has told some customers that, from Jan. 19 onward, the company will no longer accept Visa credit cards issued in Britain.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The e-commerce giant cited high fees charged by the payment processor.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visa said it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; plans to stop accepting payments made via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/V&quot;&gt;Visa&lt;/a&gt; credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The e-commerce giant has told some customers that, from Jan. 19 onward, the company will no longer accept Visa credit cards issued in Britain ” due to the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa shares fell 2.5% in U.S. premarket trading.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visa earlier this year hiked the interchange fees it charges merchants for processing digital transactions between the U.K. and the European Union.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Brexit, an EU cap on interchange fees no longer applies in the U.K., allowing card networks to raise their charges.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastercard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;has also increased its U.K.-EU interchange fees.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon customers were told they will still be able to use debit cards — including those issued by Visa — and non-Visa credit cards like Mastercard and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Express&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Users are being encouraged to update their default payment method ahead of the changes.&lt;/strong&gt; The news was first reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-will-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-u-k?srnd=technology-vp&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa said it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“U.K. shoppers can use their Visa debit and credit cards at Amazon U.K. today and throughout the holiday season,” a Visa spokesperson told CNBC.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a long-standing relationship with Amazon, and we continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon U.K. without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon blasted Visa for its high card charges. “The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers,” a spokesperson for the company told CNBC.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise.”&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move could be viewed as a way for Amazon to get some bargaining power over Visa to lower its fees. The payments firm also charges businesses scheme fees to become part of its network.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While smaller retailers aren’t in a position to negotiate, Amazon — given its size — may have better luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/amazon-to-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-uk.html&quot;&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE&quot;&gt;Visa is down about 5%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
