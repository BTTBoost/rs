To begin this off, the first thing that was weird was RH asking me to press an accept button in order to use their advance graph tool. Weird but ok.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the day, I noticed that the GME advance chart on RH would often just break and needed a page reload. It was weird to me because I had multiple graphs up but it consistently was only the RH GME advance chart that kept on failing and also kept on kicking me out of RH. So I looked into it.</p>\n\n<p>The data RH is showing has been transformed from the original data.
