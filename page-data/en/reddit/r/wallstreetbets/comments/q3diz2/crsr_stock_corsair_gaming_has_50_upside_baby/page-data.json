Partly for these reasons, Wall Street analysts have been calling for significant upside potential in Corsair stock, as we detail below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR; Low Float, High Short interest, Undervalued, Earnings are around the corner!! 🚀🚀</strong></p>\n\n<p>The last year delivered an exceptional 130% gain to the company&#39;s bottom line. Although, its longer-term performance hasn&#39;t been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. Therefore, it&#39;s fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.</p>\n\n<p>With earnings growth that&#39;s superior to most other companies of late, Corsair Gaming has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you&#39;d be hoping this isn&#39;t the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it&#39;s not quite in favor. Corsair Gaming (CRSR) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $0.33 per share on revenue of $472.9 million. This represents about a 22% increase from last year despite the economy reopening!</p>\n\n<p>-Estimates expect earnings of $1.82 per share and revenue of $2.08 billion. These totals would mark changes of +13.75% and +22.19%, respectively, from last year.</p>\n\n<p>-CRSR recently refinanced their debt, meaning they will pay a lower interest rate increasing their earnings per share.</p>\n\n<p>-CRSR has also committed to paying down its debt strengthening its balance sheet.</p>\n\n<p>-The company said it continues to expect 2021 revenue of $1.90 billion to $2.10 billion. The current consensus revenue estimate is $2.02 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per annum during the coming three years according to the eight analysts following the company. That&#39;s shaping up to be similar to the 12% each year growth forecast for the broader market.</p>\n\n<p>With this information, we can see why Corsair Gaming is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. Apparently shareholders are comfortable to simply hold on while the company is keeping a low profile.</p>\n\n<p>I have 6,700 shares at 27.74</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q3diz2/crsr_stock_corsair_gaming_has_50_upside_baby/","title":"CRSR stock Corsair gaming has 50% upside baby.
