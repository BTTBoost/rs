Since then they’ve raised $428m in fresh capital through share issuance, bringing up their total to $1.241b. This is good except their current cash burn is ~$300m/qtr which gives them 4 quarters of runway. I do think that as covid goes away completely (possibly by fall) that there’s a chance for this to stabilize. But there are a lot of variables to this such as timeline of opening and attendance rate once we are fully open.</p>\n\n<p>Next there&#39;s the valuation:</p>\n\n<p>Forget covid and let’s value them assuming everything returns to normal. Average adj. EBITDA between 2018-2019 was $850.3m. EV today using today’s stock price and 3/31/21 debt numbers is $16.1b, which gives us 18.9x EV/adj. EBITDA multiple. For comparison, the same multiple was 6.9x in 2018. So assuming things return perfectly to normal, AMC is still valued 2.7x what it was in 2018. The highest market cap that AMC had previous to this year was in 2017 when its market cap was $4.0b vs. $5.8b today.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion:</p>\n\n<p>AMC is massively overvalued (who knew). Of course, everyone will point out this is a short squeeze opportunity like GME. However, there will probably never be another GME which once had 141% short interest at its peak vs. ~20% for AMC now. What that means is GME had a legitimate reason for its stock price to completely decouple from its fundamentals, AMC doesn’t, not to quite the extent of GME. There may be some squeezes here and there, but more players will join the short when they see how overvalued AMC is.</p>\n\n<p>The current buying is predominantly from retail, and the CEO even boasted as much saying retail investors comprise of 80% of the share base. While people think this is a positive, I disagree. There is a reason institutional ownership is low and it means that while the stock price can certainly continue to go up, it will also shoot down just as fast, once everyone begins to exit. With a short interest of 20%, how are 80% of the people going to get out? Who are they going to sell to? In the end, it will just be a shifting of bags amongst the retail.</p>\n\n<p>If I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute the share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don’t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It’s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people are propping this up as something of a fight for the common people against the hedgies, who have done all the wrong. I actually think this can be quite irresponsible it’s driving people to pour into AMC, basically like a Ponzi scheme. Invest safely!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ncl56i/why_i_think_amc_will_result_in_bagholders/","title":"Why I Think AMC Will Result In Bagholders","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"May 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-15T00:41:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-15 00:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5a9d1493-0f4a-5dcf-9ab3-776b282cf89f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ncl56i/why_i_think_amc_will_result_in_bagholders/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ncl56i/why_i_think_amc_will_result_in_bagholders/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Fishonamission2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fishonamission2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Fishonamission2","score":12,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AMCがバッグホルダーになると思う理由","the_new_excerpt":"さて、これはかなり嫌われるかもしれませんが、私はAMCが月に絞るという説を信じません。\nというテーゼは、いくつかの理由から信じられません。\n\nまず、流動性について見てみよう。\n\n21年3月31日時点で、AMCには8億1300万ドルの現金がありました。それ以来、彼らは、株式発行、新株式発行、買収などにより、4億2800万ドルの新規資金を調達しました。\n株式発行により4億2800万ドルの新規資金を調達し、合計12億4100万ドルとなりました。これは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么我认为AMC将导致袋鼠的出现","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，这将是相当不受欢迎的，但我不相信AMC会挤到\n的论调，原因有几个。\n\n让我们看一下流动性。\n\n截至21年3月31日，AMC有8.13亿美元的现金。自那时起，他们已经通过发行股票、收购和收购等方式筹集了4.28亿美元的新资本。\n他们通过发行股票筹集了4.28亿美元的新资本，使其总额达到12.41亿美元。这是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼我認爲AMC將導致袋鼠的出現","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，這將是相當不受歡迎的，但我不相信AMC會擠到\n的論調，原因有幾個。\n\n讓我們看一下流動性。\n\n截至21年3月31日，AMC有8.13億美元的現金。自那時起，他們已經通過發行股票、收購和收購等方式籌集了4.28億美元的新資本。\n他們通過發行股票籌集了4.28億美元的新資本，使其總額達到12.41億美元。這是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3922c106-d523-57ee-bdee-b48fd7d202c0","excerpt":"'Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) will employ 75,000 logistics and fulfillment\nworkers in North America at an average starting wage of $17 an hour.\n\nMost of the hires will be placed at the company fulfillment locations and\nnetwork of local delivery centers after positioning its final-mile…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ncfwmz/amazon_to_hire_75k_fulfillment_workers_with/","title":"Amazon To Hire 75K Fulfillment Workers With Starting Hourly Pay Of $17, Bonuses Up To $1K","date":"May 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アマゾン、75,000人のフルフィルメント・ワーカーを採用、初任時給17ドル、ボーナスは最大1,000ドル","the_new_excerpt":"「Amazon.com Inc（NASDAQ：AMZN）は、75,000人の物流・フルフィルメントの\nは、北米で75,000人の物流・フルフィルメント部門の従業員を、平均時給17ドルで雇用します。\n\nこの雇用の大半は、同社のフルフィルメント拠点とローカル配送センターのネットワークに配置されます。\nまた、ファイナルマイル（最終配送地点）に位置する配送センターのネットワークにも配置されます。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"亚马逊将招聘7.5万名配送员，起薪为每小时17美元，奖金高达1千美元","the_new_excerpt":"亚马逊公司（NASDAQ: AMZN）将在北美雇佣7.5万名物流和执行人员，平均起薪为每小时17美元。\n的工人，平均起薪为每小时17美元。\n\n大部分员工将被安置在公司的执行地点和当地的配送中心网络。\n在定位其最后一英里后，大部分员工将被安置在公司的履行地点和当地的交付中心网络。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亞馬遜將招聘7.5萬名配送員，起薪爲每小時17美元，獎金高達1千美元","the_new_excerpt":"亞馬遜公司（NASDAQ: AMZN）將在北美僱傭7.5萬名物流和執行人員，平均起薪爲每小時17美元。\n的工人，平均起薪爲每小時17美元。\n\n大部分員工將被安置在公司的執行地點和當地的配送中心網絡。\n在定位其最後一英里後，大部分員工將被安置在公司的履行地點和當地的交付中心網絡。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a17a3820-2b3c-5ce2-bf6a-52c55b913013","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncdviv/are_we_still_doing_gain_porns/","title":"Are we still doing gain porns?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 15, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゲインポーンはまだやってるの？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们是否还在做增益性的色情节目？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們是否還在做增益性的色情節目？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-5a9d1493-0f4a-5dcf-9ab3-776b282cf89f","previousId":"RedditPost-3922c106-d523-57ee-bdee-b48fd7d202c0","nextId":"RedditPost-a17a3820-2b3c-5ce2-bf6a-52c55b913013","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ncl56i/why_i_think_amc_will_result_in_bagholders/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
