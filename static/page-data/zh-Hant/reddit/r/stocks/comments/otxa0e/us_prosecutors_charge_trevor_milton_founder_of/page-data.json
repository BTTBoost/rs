href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKLA\">Nikola</a>, was indicted on three counts of criminal fraud by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan for allegedly lying about “nearly all aspects of the business,” according to a grand jury indictment unsealed Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>Prosecutors charged the billionaire, who resigned as chairman in September, with two counts of securities fraud, including making false statements about the company, and wire fraud.</p>\n\n<p>“Milton’s scheme targeted individual, non-professional investors — so-called retail investors — by making false and misleading statements directly to the investing public through social media, and television, print and podcast interviews,” prosecutors said in the 49-page indictment. </p>\n\n<p>Milton, who was the company’s largest shareholder, was held roughly $8.5 billion in Nikola stock at the height of the company’s value.</p>\n\n<p>Shares of Nikola were down by more than 9% during premarket trading to less than $13 a share.</p>\n\n<p>The grand jury said Milton shall forfeit all property “traceable to the commission of said offenses,” which would likely include the more than $1 billion he earned when Nikola went public in June 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Prosecutors said Milton “was motivated to engage in the fraudulent scheme in order to enrich himself and elevate his stature as an entrepreneur.”</p>\n\n<p><a
