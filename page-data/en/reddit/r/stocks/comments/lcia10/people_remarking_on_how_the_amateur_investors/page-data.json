I apologise for bringing it up yet again.</p>\n\n<p>However I am continuously seeing remarks being passed around in the comments sections such as how &quot;Amateur investors who didnt know what they were doing were stupid for gambling their money and trying to make a quick dollar on GME&quot; and how they are all &quot;idiots with tin foil hats for believing the conspiracies of market manipulation&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like people who weren&#39;t involved in the GME events really and truly dont understand what took place. </p>\n\n<p>It was theft in broad day light. The hedge funds were like the spoiled kid at a park who takes his ball and leaves because hes losing at the game. The moment it wasnt working for the hedge funds the illusion of free market was popped. </p>\n\n<p>Let me go through a little bit of what took place:</p>\n\n<p>When the hedge funds were cornered and the squeeze was triggered (on both Thursday and the following Tuesday) all retail investors were blocked from buying GME and could only sell. This will inevitably create a crash in price. The moment the price crashed they lifted the limitations. It was black and white what they were doing. </p>\n\n<p>On top of this, right as this event was in full swing a wide range of articles and new channels started promoting how social media has moved on from GME to focus on SLV (Really!??)... nobody was focusing on silver. The price of silver was driven up buy the hedge funds pre market and immediately started declining again while the news continued to emphasis the end of the GME squeeze (which wasnt over, it was blocked from happening) all the while dribbling on about the SLV craze (that didnt exist). Coincidentally the hedge funds involved in the GME situation also happen to profit highly from the SLV hype that was created.</p>\n\n<p>And last but not least, there was (and still is) clear evidence that hedge funds have been continuously trading GME back and forth all week at lower and lower prices to artificially drive down the price and cause retail investors to lose interest in GME (...or essentially give up).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not writing all of this in spite of your remarks... I genuinly think people need to understand what actually tool place with GME. So many claims of amateur investors trying to jump in to make a quick dollar and how they failed..  no they were all robbed in broad day light. Most people knew what they were doing and simply did not anticipate this level of broad day light market manipulation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lcia10/people_remarking_on_how_the_amateur_investors/","title":"People remarking on how the \"amateur investors\" tried to make a quick dollar on GME and failed should read this.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T16:18:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 16:18","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a9edb914-e785-5ef3-8374-236dbc337546","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcia10/people_remarking_on_how_the_amateur_investors/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lcia10/people_remarking_on_how_the_amateur_investors/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ImReellySmart","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ImReellySmart","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ImReellySmart","score":2440,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"评论 \"业余投资者 \"如何试图在GME上赚取快速美元而失败的人应该读一读这个。","the_new_excerpt":"我知道现在每个人的耳朵一定都被融化了，因为所有的GME都在不停地播放。\n说话。我为再次提出这个问题而道歉。\n\n然而，我不断地看到评论中流传着这样的言论。\n诸如 \"不知道自己在做什么的业余投资人是怎样的 \"等章节。\n愚蠢的","locale":"zh"},{"title":"評論 \"業餘投資者 \"如何試圖在GME上賺取快速美元而失敗的人應該讀一讀這個。","the_new_excerpt":"我知道現在每個人的耳朵一定都被融化了，因爲所有的GME都在不停地播放。\n說話。我爲再次提出這個問題而道歉。\n\n然而，我不斷地看到評論中流傳着這樣的言論。\n諸如 \"不知道自己在做什麼的業餘投資人是怎樣的 \"等章節。\n愚蠢的","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cc6db3ec-bcdd-52ad-bf7f-b4944a48c557","excerpt":"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list\nbecause I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.
