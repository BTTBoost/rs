With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.</em> Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Main Watchlist:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gapping UP:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>COIN</li>\n<li>TSLA</li>\n<li>HOOD</li>\n<li>DKNG</li>\n<li>NVTA</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Gapping DOWN:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AXSM</li>\n<li>OXY</li>\n<li>FANG</li>\n<li>WYNN</li>\n<li>DLTR</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Market Outlook:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after we saw the indices push for new ATH to end last week&#39;s trading. Berkshire Hathaway reported better-than-expected profit growth for Q2. Tesla delayed cybertruck production until 2022, but the stock is up this morning on a price target upgrade. China has been reacting to various COVID outbreaks, and I fear the US could see more strict measures in the near future as well. This is worth following closely, as any lockdowns or countermeasures could be detrimental to stocks in the short-term, particularly the reopening plays. </p>\n\n<p>SPY is trading a bit under 442, and we could see some indecision this morning after hitting fresh ATH on Friday. DIA and QQQ are in similar technical levels after hitting fresh ATH in Friday&#39;s trading as well. I think we could be in for some choppiness, I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on UVXY if we do see some weakness. If we see strength and a push back towards ATH, then the strength should continue. Gold and silver are down a bit this morning, while crude oil is down considerably this morning. This is worth following closely, as crude oil is up quite a bit year-to-date and could see this as a correction. Marijuana stocks have been quiet the past few days, but the charts are looking bullish, especially if we see some strength and volume in the next few days. </p>\n\n<p>Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p10lkd/morning_update_for_monday_080921/","title":"Morning Update for Monday, 08/09/21","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-09T21:30:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-09 21:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a5c8ad32-b525-5454-babe-f62301a59351","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p10lkd/morning_update_for_monday_080921/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p10lkd/morning_update_for_monday_080921/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"vanturetrading","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/vanturetrading","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"vanturetrading","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"08/09/21(月)のモーニングアップデート","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、おはようございます！週末は楽しめましたか？\n\n今回のリストはデイトレード向けのものです。特にモメンタムウォッチリストについて。\n私は通常、非常に迅速に出入りします。\n通常はより早いスキャルピングです。トレードを開始する際には、常に計画を立ててください...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"08/09/21星期一的最新情况","the_new_excerpt":"大家早上好，我希望你享受你的周末!\n\n这份清单是针对日间交易的。尤其是动量观察表。\n我通常会很快进入和退出，只是偶尔会超过两三分钟。\n分钟，通常是快速剥头皮。当你进入一个交易时，总是有一个计划...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"08/09/21星期一的最新情況","the_new_excerpt":"大家早上好，我希望你享受你的週末!\n\n這份清單是針對日間交易的。尤其是動量觀察表。\n我通常會很快進入和退出，只是偶爾會超過兩三分鐘。\n分鐘，通常是快速剝頭皮。當你進入一個交易時，總是有一個計劃...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8f7ca4bc-5f9a-5b77-a4b6-65f3c406fa50","excerpt":"100% VT","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p18fbt/rate_my_portfolio/","title":"Rate my portfolio","date":"August 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私のポートフォリオを評価する","the_new_excerpt":"100% VT","locale":"ja"},{"title":"给我的投资组合评分","the_new_excerpt":"100%的VT","locale":"zh"},{"title":"給我的投資組合評分","the_new_excerpt":"100%的VT","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-1978e8f9-068d-527c-a582-18b5ad3af1e6","excerpt":"Today I logged into Mint and noticed I had hit two milestones at the same time:\nMy personal 401k has reached $400k, and total assets (including wife's\nretirement plan) had reached $700k.
