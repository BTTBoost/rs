Cheniere inked its latest GSA with Tourmaline in July. Under the deals, Cheniere buys natural gas at prices linked to JKM, subjecting it to commodity price fluctuations that its LNG buyers typically assume under long-term offtake agreements.”</p>\n\n<p>Cheniere is doing the exact opposite of what they SHOULD be doing! They are blessed to have a business in an industry that could profit from a crazy US (Henry hub) to Europe (TTF)/ Asia (JKM) arbitrage. Right now, Henry Hub is $5 and JKM/TTF are both over $25!!! </p>\n\n<p>Why in the world are they SOURCING gas and paying based on JKM prices???? Its crazy!</p>\n\n<p>So I’ll stick with the high risk/ high reward $TELL play. The Driftwood project is becoming more of a reality every day that passes and when we are up and running, we will be integrated- controlling costs by owning our own upstream assets and SELLING at JKM/TTF linked pricing (not buying at jkm/ttf like cheniere….mind boggling)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/psixxp/lng_great_industry_terrible_strategy/","title":"$LNG- Great Industry, Terrible Strategy","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-21T18:25:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-21 18:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"psixxp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/psixxp/lng_great_industry_terrible_strategy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/psixxp/lng_great_industry_terrible_strategy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"E-garr","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/E-garr","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"E-garr","score":55,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$LNG-素晴らしい産業、恐ろしい戦略","the_new_excerpt":"巨大な$TELLブル（私の他のDD投稿を参照）として、私はよく尋ねられます。「なぜCheniere（ティッカー：LNG）にしないのか？\nCheniere(ティッカー $LNG)にしたらどうですか」とよく聞かれます。\n\n最近まで、その答えはとてもシンプルでした-「Tellurianの最初の一歩を踏み出したい」。\nテルリアンの一階部分に入りたいから」です。\n\nそれが私の答えだったのですが、この記事を読んで、なぜCheniereが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"LNG--伟大的产业，糟糕的战略","the_new_excerpt":"作为一个巨大的$TELL牛人（见我的其他DD帖子），我经常被问到。\"为什么不直接选择\n购入Cheniere（股票代码：$LNG）\"？\n\n直到最近，我的回答都很简单--\"我想在Tellurian的底层进入。\n我想加入Tellurian的底层。\"\n\n这就是我的答案，直到我读到这篇关于为什么Cheniere错过了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"LNG--偉大的產業，糟糕的戰略","the_new_excerpt":"作爲一個巨大的$TELL牛人（見我的其他DD帖子），我經常被問到。\"爲什麼不直接選擇\n購入Cheniere（股票代碼：$LNG）\"？\n\n直到最近，我的回答都很簡單--\"我想在Tellurian的底層進入。\n我想加入Tellurian的底層。\"\n\n這就是我的答案，直到我讀到這篇關於爲什麼Cheniere錯過了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-psizyw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/psizyw/i_just_dont_care_when_people_mocking_me_buying/","title":"I just don't care when people mocking me buying $LCID.","date":"September 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ただ、$LCIDを買っている私を馬鹿にする人がいても気にしません。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我只是不在意人们嘲笑我买了$LCID。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我只是不在意人們嘲笑我買了$LCID。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pskeac","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pskeac/yolo_live_to_drive_a_lucid_you_retards/","title":"Yolo, live to drive a Lucid you retards!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 21, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ヨロシク！ルシードに乗るために生きろ！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！（笑","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Yolo，活着开Lucid，你们这些弱智!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Yolo，活着開Lucid，你們這些弱智!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-psixxp","previousId":"RedditPost-psizyw","nextId":"RedditPost-pskeac","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/psixxp/lng_great_industry_terrible_strategy/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
