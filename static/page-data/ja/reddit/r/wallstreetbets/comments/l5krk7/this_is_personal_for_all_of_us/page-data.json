A tug of war between tradition and the future.</p>\n\n<p>Hedge fund managers live in the past, and continue to look down upon the retail investors.

WE NEED HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO! SAVE US!</p>\n\n<p>This is the world they want to live in. This was the past.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that scene from the Sopranos, where Tony&#39;s wife calls to buy 5000 shares of Webonics, after she was manipulated emotionally to so?  Institutions and hedge funds want us to be stuck in that world.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re scared of the future.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re scared because, so much information is available for free now. THere&#39;s no more fees for trading. We have large communities that discuss stocks and trading openly.</p>\n\n<p>We can think and make decisions for ourselves, which scares the FUCK out of old school institutions and hedge funds.</p>\n\n<p>Fuck them all. This affects every single one of you, whether or not you&#39;re holding $GME.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Fuck hedge funds. This is a crosspoint into the future.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: STOP GIVING ME AWARDS!
