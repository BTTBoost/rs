He began by pointing out Disney&#39;s &quot;long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience,&quot; offering examples such as Steamboat Willie (one of the first cartoons to be produced with synchronized sound), its historical use of animatronics, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/thor-love-and-thunder\">and</a> broadly the technological work of Pixar in its animations.  </p>\n\n<p>He went on: &quot;Suffice it to say, our efforts today are merely a prologue to a time when we&#39;ll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse. We look forward to creating unparalelled opportunities for consumers to experience everything Disney has to offer across our product and platforms wherever the consumer may be.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;As we look ahead to this next frontier, given our unique combination of brands, franchises, physical and digital experiences, and global reach, we see limitless potential, and that makes us as excited as ever about the Walt Disney Company&#39;s next 100 years.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>If you feel like we&#39;ve been hearing about the metaverse a lot lately, it&#39;s because in the last year a lot of massive tech companies have been getting in on the idea. We&#39;ve been hearing about it for a while now, with companies in gaming like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-epic-games-metaverse-and-is-it-worth-billions\">Epic Games</a> seemingly interested in creating a persistent, virtual space that bridges the gap between virtual and the real world, and where people can interact with one another in real time. As more gaming companies brought it up, some have suggested that games such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Second Life already exist as a sort of proto-metaverse. But that hasn&#39;t stopped companies like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-metaverse-announcement\">Microsoft</a> and Facebook (which just <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/facebook-new-name-meta\">rebranded to Meta</a> for exactly this reason) for also trying to take control of whatever this virtual future looks like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-metaverse\">Now Disney&#39;s Going in on the Metaverse, Too - IGN</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qr88fh/disneys_plans_to_go_to_metaverse/","title":"Disney's plans to go to Metaverse","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T15:30:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 15:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qr88fh","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qr88fh/disneys_plans_to_go_to_metaverse/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qr88fh/disneys_plans_to_go_to_metaverse/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"gorays21","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/gorays21","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"gorays21","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ディズニーのメタヴァースへの計画","the_new_excerpt":"> ディズニーのCEOであるボブ・チャペックは、本日行われた通期の決算説明会で、初めてメタバースのアイデアを株主に紹介しました。\n> メタバースのアイデアを初めて株主に紹介しました。彼はまず、以下のように述べました。\n> ディズニーは、「エンターテインメント体験を向上させるための技術の使用に早くから取り組んできました。\n> エンタテインメント体験を向上させるためにテクノロジーをいち早く採用してきたディズニーの長年の実績」を紹介し、その例として...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"迪士尼的计划是去Metaverse","the_new_excerpt":"> 在今天的全年收益电话会议上，迪斯尼首席执行官Bob Chapek首次向股东提出了\n> 第一次向股东们提出了 \"元空间 \"的概念。他首先指出\n> 迪斯尼 \"作为一个早期采用技术的公司的长期记录\"。\n> 以增强娱乐体验\"，并提供了一些例子。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"迪士尼的計劃是去Metaverse","the_new_excerpt":"> 在今天的全年收益電話會議上，迪斯尼首席執行官Bob Chapek首次向股東提出了\n> 第一次向股東們提出了 \"元空間 \"的概念。他首先指出\n> 迪斯尼 \"作爲一個早期採用技術的公司的長期記錄\"。\n> 以增強娛樂體驗\"，並提供了一些例子。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1458716009645420546","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1458716009645420546","title":"Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose vaccine plunged from 86% to just 13% protection against COVID over 6 months ***","date":"November 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ジョンソン・アンド・ジョンソン社の単回接種ワクチンは、6ヶ月間でCOVIDに対する防御率が86%からわずか13%にまで低下した。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"强生公司的单剂量疫苗在6个月内对COVID的保护率从86%骤降到只有13% ***。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"強生公司的單劑量疫苗在6個月內對COVID的保護率從86%驟降到只有13% ***。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qr88fh","previousId":"TweetPost-1458716009645420546","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qr88fh/disneys_plans_to_go_to_metaverse/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
