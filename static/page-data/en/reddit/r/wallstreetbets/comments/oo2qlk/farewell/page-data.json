But first, a little about me:</p>\n\n<p>At the age of 16 I joined the French Foreign Legion (FFL). Throughout my time in the FFL, I served in many theaters and battles. One in particular, the Battle of North Sentinel Island, I was captured by Yakuza operatives and became a prisoner of war. I managed to escape and was awarded the Buerre de Cacahuètes au Poisson distinction for heroism (<a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eyindthb0bc71.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bcdcc7fedbb3941f632e66274d67144e3c69b4b\">pictured</a>), the highest honor one can receive in the FFL. I never wanted to be a hero. Alas, we cannot choose our own fate. After my discharge from the FFL, I was recruited by the Canadian government as a contractor to head their electronic surveillance unit mainly focused on their efforts to topple the Canadian Eco-terrorist Organization known as the Castor en Colere Liberation Front.  I served honorably alongside <a href=\"/u/opinion_is_unpopular\">u/opinion_is_unpopular</a>. We shared many nights in the tundra huddled by the campfire in our beaver skin tunics sharing war stories over bowls of poutine, as is tradition.  Despite all of the wonderful things I have personally done single-handedly to improve the world, I pride myself on being a humble man. Currently, I am an entrepreneur and run 4 businesses. DM me for my ETSY link. What does any of this have to do with moderating you ask? Well, nothing.</p>\n\n<p>The actions of the past week are inexcusable. I must apologize to the community for allowing myself to be honey-potted by <a href=\"/u/memetron9000\">u/memetron9000</a>. What started off as friendly banter on our side project <a href=\"/r/RunicCocksElite\">r/RunicCocksElite</a>, quickly evolved into much more. It got pretty serious, as we would discuss the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model deep into the night. One thing led to another and he was soon sending feet pics.  Little did I know the FUD he would unleash on this community after I allowed him to become a moderator.</p>\n\n<p>The screenshots that were shared are true. They were taken from a private conversation I had with <a href=\"/u/fannypackphantom\">u/fannypackphantom</a> discussing my past membership in a cannibal coven practicing Juju magic in Sierra Leone. I first met fanny over Twitter and we bonded over a tweet I made regarding the socioeconomic implications of a woman shopping at Duluth Traders for her wardrobe needs.   She was very accepting of my cannibalistic past and I felt comfortable sharing intimate details. Casual conversations amongst what I thought was a friend has now come back to haunt me now that I am a celebrity.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it was I who modded <a href=\"/u/pokimane\">u/pokimane</a>. This is significant because the MSM media would like you to believe that Covid-19 caused the March 2020 recession when in fact it was her appointment as a moderator of <a href=\"/r/wallstreetbets\">r/wallstreetbets</a> that served as the catalyst. Please do not harass her, she is not a Shill.  We have conducted extensive research into her background, mannerisms, and idiosyncrasies and can confirm this. <a href=\"/u/zjz\">u/zjz</a> has also deployed his shill sniffing bot with negative results. Unfortunately, this has triggered a crippling addiction to her Twitch stream and has rendered him more financially desperate than even most of you poors.</p>\n\n<p>I have done everything in my power to serve this community. Heroic actions such as deleting the unrelenting barrage of trash memes posted by <a href=\"/u/throwaway1forall\">u/throwaway1forall</a>, banning 99% of people who play flair or ban, and encouraging <a href=\"/u/yolocallking\">u/yolocallking</a> to include more Brazilian bundas in his memes are just a small sample of the personal sacrifices I have made.</p>\n\n<p>I know so many of you hate me and honestly, fine. I am use to that. I am a Juju practitioner, Heterosexual, wonderful, famous, and amazing. I have always been this way and I am not ashamed of who I am. Had I still been the old Sdevil with the autists at my side, I’d have endured it and risked my life for the community, like I have so many times before. However, I see no reason to risk it and I will resign effective July 21, 2045. In the interim, I will be at <a href=\"/r/RunicCocksElite\">r/RunicCocksElite</a> awaiting the arrival of <a href=\"/u/sloptart69\">u/sloptart69</a> in order to apprentice in the ancient ritual of sugar water immersion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/MarkCuban\">u/MarkCuban</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/PresidentObama\">u/PresidentObama</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/JoannaGaines\">u/JoannaGaines</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/ElonMusk\">u/ElonMusk</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/PopeFrancis\">u/PopeFrancis</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/RachaelDolezal\">u/RachaelDolezal</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/1r0nyman\">u/1r0nyman</a></p>\n\n<p>P.S. If you have gotten this far and believe any of this,  you are in fact a moron. Stay Stonky!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oo2qlk/farewell/","title":"Farewell","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"July 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-20T19:23:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-20 19:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e3988718-e33f-5c75-bc1c-ebe9291c0cf3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oo2qlk/farewell/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oo2qlk/farewell/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"sdevil713","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/sdevil713","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"sdevil713","score":3965,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"お別れ","the_new_excerpt":"最近の出来事により、私は重い気持ちでrwallstreetbets[/r/wallstreetbets]のモデレーターを辞任することをお知らせしなければなりません。\nr/wallstreetbets [/r/wallstreetbets]のモデレーターを辞任します。\n\n私の最後の投稿としてこれを書き、私の言い分を明らかにしたいと思います。\nその前に、私について少し説明します。\n\n16歳でフランスの外国人部隊に入隊...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"再见了","the_new_excerpt":"由于最近发生的事件，我必须怀着沉重的心情通知你们，我将会\n辞去r/wallstreetbets [/r/wallstreetbets]的版主职务。\n\n我想把这篇文章作为我的最后一篇文章来写，并澄清我的观点。\n但首先，关于我的一些情况。\n\n在16岁的时候，我加入了法国外交部...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"再見了","the_new_excerpt":"由於最近發生的事件，我必須懷着沉重的心情通知你們，我將會\n辭去r/wallstreetbets [/r/wallstreetbets]的版主職務。\n\n我想把這篇文章作爲我的最後一篇文章來寫，並澄清我的觀點。\n但首先，關於我的一些情況。\n\n在16歲的時候，我加入了法國外交部...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-69b4dcf4-c5f5-52d7-b67d-2ca0d2fb19f0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/oo5bth/historical_top_performing_asset_classes_by_year/","title":"Historical Top Performing Asset Classes by Year!
