The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve’s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the “substantial progress” benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.</p>\n\n<p>As was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. </p>\n\n<p>The Fed said in a statement, “In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on &quot;changes in the economic outlook.&quot; Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. </p>\n\n<p>New weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:</strong> 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week</li>\n<li><strong>Continuing claims, week ended October 23:</strong> 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion.
