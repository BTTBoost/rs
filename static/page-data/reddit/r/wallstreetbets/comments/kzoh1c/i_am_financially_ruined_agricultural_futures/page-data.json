This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I&#39;d try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year&#39;s gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/","title":"I am financially ruined (agricultural futures)","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-18T11:53:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-18 11:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b0176b3f-a2c5-5c49-b04e-25e30abb6435","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"TheEmperorOfJenks","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheEmperorOfJenks","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TheEmperorOfJenks","score":10861,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我的财务被毁了（农产品期货","the_new_excerpt":"我已经失去了一切，我不知道该如何继续。这个夏天，我投资了\n一万七千五百元（半年工资和我一生的积蓄）投入观赏葫芦\n期货，希望能抓住这个利润丰厚的新兴行业。在\n看了一段关于Vincent Kosuga和他的洋葱垄断的视频，我... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的財務被毀了（農產品期貨","the_new_excerpt":"我已經失去了一切，我不知道該如何繼續。這個夏天，我投資了\n一萬七千五百元（半年工資和我一生的積蓄）投入觀賞葫蘆\n期貨，希望能抓住這個利潤豐厚的新興行業。在\n看了一段關於Vincent Kosuga和他的洋蔥壟斷的視頻，我... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b47e19a1-d178-5450-a0fd-72bf470585c1","excerpt":"I called the shipping hub for the GameStop stores in my area, and an associate\nconfirmed that gamer PC hardware is coming!
