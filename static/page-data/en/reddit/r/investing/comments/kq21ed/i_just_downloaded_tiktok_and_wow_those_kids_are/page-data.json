Very few tiktoks explain compound interest or index fund investing. Most commonly recommended stocks are all super high IV stocks like NIO, PLTR, QS etc. I may have seen 50 tiktoks saying to invest in Dogecoin and that it’ll go to $1 a coin. People think that Bitcoin is going to straight shot to $400k and replace gold without any corrections. Almost all the tips on real estate investing is solely wholesaling. No advice on how to secure an FHA loan on a rental property and refinancing etc. There were diamonds in a rough but very few. I hope kids aren’t going all in on Dogecoin thinking it’ll 100x. Times are changing though and maybe this is signaling a shift in investing overall in the future. Time will tell, I don’t want to sit here and say they’re dumb because that would be ignorant.
