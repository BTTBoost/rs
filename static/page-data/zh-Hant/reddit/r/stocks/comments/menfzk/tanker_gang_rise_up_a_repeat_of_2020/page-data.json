They don&#39;t like the fact their Suezmax ships are old and think their book value is overstated due to the age of their ships. Book value doesn&#39;t mean much for an operating company that&#39;s not in danger of bankruptcy. It&#39;s profits, cashflow and ability to service debt that really counts. They&#39;re able to keep these old ships running, even using the latest low sulphur fuels and pay most profits earned as dividends. They&#39;re basically the slumlords of tankers and if you&#39;ve ever been involved in real estate, you know those slums cash flow much better than Trump level properties.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, tanker stocks generally suck and tanker gang got burned after oil futures trading returned to normal.</p>\n\n<p>We like short dated options plays on the tanker with the greatest meme power.</p>\n\n<p>Do what you will with this information. This is gambling, not investing and we don&#39;t provide financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/menfzk/tanker_gang_rise_up_a_repeat_of_2020/","title":"Tanker Gang Rise Up; a Repeat of 2020?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-28T02:54:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-28 02:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d8024899-7b84-5350-a135-cbc89543abe5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/menfzk/tanker_gang_rise_up_a_repeat_of_2020/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/menfzk/tanker_gang_rise_up_a_repeat_of_2020/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"bannercoin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bannercoin","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"bannercoin","score":142,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"坦克帮崛起；2020年重演？","the_new_excerpt":"首先，查看https://istheshipstillstuck.com/，如果答案是 \"是\"，在\n周一上午，看油轮股的走势。\n\n去年4月，石油期货出现阴跌，这造就了 \"油轮帮\"。射击\n到备忘录的状态是一个油轮股票，$ NAT和股票从3元/股以下运行\n到...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"坦克幫崛起；2020年重演？","the_new_excerpt":"首先，查看https://istheshipstillstuck.com/，如果答案是 \"是\"，在\n週一上午，看油輪股的走勢。\n\n去年4月，石油期貨出現陰跌，這造就了 \"油輪幫\"。射擊\n到備忘錄的狀態是一個油輪股票，$ NAT和股票從3元/股以下運行\n到...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9866083c-238e-5f2d-b73f-b847848aa74e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mehxm6/who_needs_life_savings_anyway_amirite_held_it_for/","title":"Who needs life “savings” anyway amirite?
