If they were killing it, you wouldn&#39;t get it at a discount.  You make money by being ahead of Wall Street, and right now Wall Street focuses on old measurements and mature companies.  You only hit it big if you can see what most people can&#39;t, or won&#39;t see.  Go watch DFV videos on YouTube from last July.</p>\n\n<p>Ryan Cohen is a freaking genius.

Let&#39;s just say I have a material portion of my net worth in GME.  But ultimately, you either believe in the company or not.  I have 35 years of accounting and executive mgmt - I&#39;ve studied up on this company.  Considering the success and expertise of the people driving the GME rocket, I&#39;m all in and I&#39;m not folding.  </p>\n\n<p>The gaming industry is bigger than movies and all North American sports - COMBINED, and these are committed customers trust me.  It&#39;s like asking an addict if they plan to buy drugs this year.  Duh, they are going to buy more.</p>\n\n<p>When you think about what is on the line for these hedge funds, did you really think they were just going to fold?  Those bastards only win if you quit.  Hold the stock because it&#39;s a really good investment, not because it&#39;s a short-squeeze opportunity, though that&#39;s some nice icing on the top.
