Assets are now on sale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then kept pressing the button to generate more text.</p>\n\n<p>It generated this glorious screed hawking a beat the market get rich quick book.</p>\n\n<p>Everything below the first line is 100% generated by InferKit, in order about 200 words at a time, by me simply pushing the button.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The market always goes up. Assets are now on sale.</p>\n\n<p>I have to ask: What price can you sell assets at? The answer: Anything.</p>\n\n<p>Profits are up, but have been rising for the past four quarters, averaging 13%, and higher than the S&amp;P 500&#39;s average profit, 5%.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I&#39;m expecting the price of the S&amp;P 500 to rise, but not at the rate of 1% per quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Even if profits only rise 2% a quarter, the S&amp;P 500 should still beat the 10-year Treasury, 6%, with current earnings, meaning buying it is a good deal for the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Also note: The market is reflecting the highest profit margins in three years.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the downside to selling out your holdings?</p>\n\n<p>What if I told you that it would be perfectly reasonable to expect the S&amp;P 500 to go up another 25% to 50%?</p>\n\n<p>Would you listen?</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you may have missed your chance to capitalize on this sweet trade. That&#39;s because prices have already peaked.</p>\n\n<p>This is all in my good fortune-making book, and I&#39;ll explain in a moment, but first, here are the charts:</p>\n\n<p>The charts are bullish, but this is an unusual time.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, I usually come out with a contrarian read on the market. Usually, people think I&#39;m being negative. Not this time.</p>\n\n<p>My contrarian read on the market is the same as my buy-and-hold: it&#39;s time to sell.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always said this is a bubble, and it&#39;s a fact. For a lot of people, it&#39;s going to be hard to sell even when the selling&#39;s over.</p>\n\n<p>I often say the market&#39;s going to go up and come back down. That&#39;s because the market is a tremendous buyer of stocks. Most people don&#39;t know it, but you can&#39;t buy more stocks than the market will buy them.</p>\n\n<p>The reason is simple. If the market has $10 trillion in stocks, it will want them all.</p>\n\n<p>To put it another way: If a corner store has $1 billion in stocks, it&#39;ll only buy stock in the store. So why would it buy the $1 billion in the corner store? It can&#39;t, unless it&#39;s a real businessman.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you know when a market&#39;s going to pop?</p>\n\n<p>Simple. When the top 1% own 80% of the stocks.</p>\n\n<p>And right now, the top 1% owns 80% of stocks. It&#39;s their time to run.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, if you&#39;re in the 1%, when the stock market runs higher, that&#39;s your time to run.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say the market goes up 50%. Most people think that&#39;s crazy, but no. It&#39;s not. At that point, 80% of the stocks will go up 50%. And the top 1% will have to dump their stock.</p>\n\n<p>At that point, they&#39;re not missing out on profits, they&#39;re not out of the market. They&#39;re running for the exit. That&#39;s why I say the market is a bubble.</p>\n\n<p>How can this happen?</p>\n\n<p>First, the problem is too much debt. Over the past few years, the average household has been taking on $30,000 a year in credit card debt.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re not debt-free, now&#39;s not the time to start.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the Fed is a big part of the problem. They&#39;re crazy. No matter what they say, they&#39;re going to keep pushing the dollar higher.</p>\n\n<p>But what if you can&#39;t get out now?</p>\n\n<p>What if you&#39;re already in the top 1%, and have no savings and are spending everything?</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s okay. I know you&#39;ll find a way.</p>\n\n<p>But what if you can&#39;t find a way?</p>\n\n<p>Then consider my book.</p>\n\n<p>The book is like a guide to trading. There&#39;s no methodology. No charts. Just good common sense. And more importantly, plenty of actionable advice.</p>\n\n<p>I tell you what to buy and sell.</p>\n\n<p>I tell you which stocks to buy and sell.</p>\n\n<p>I tell you when to buy and when to sell.</p>\n\n<p>I tell you how to handle a bear market.</p>\n\n<p>But most importantly, I teach you how to time the market. The thing is, most people think they can time the market. They don&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>They don&#39;t because they don&#39;t know how to time a real market.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you tell me it&#39;s 10 AM and there&#39;s a bear market, I don&#39;t know what you mean. I&#39;ll ask, &quot;What time is the market in the morning?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ten minutes to 10 AM.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So when is the market today?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t know. You don&#39;t know what time the market is.</p>\n\n<p>In the real world, if there&#39;s a bear market, there&#39;s no single day of time. But I&#39;ll tell you when to sell everything.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll understand what I&#39;m saying when you read the book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ps1ali/i_played_with_an_ai_text_generator_and_all_i_got/","title":"I played with an AI text generator and all I got was this article that tries to sell a beat the market get rich quick book","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"September 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-21T01:14:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-21 01:14","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ps1ali","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ps1ali/i_played_with_an_ai_text_generator_and_all_i_got/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ps1ali/i_played_with_an_ai_text_generator_and_all_i_got/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"AlphaTerminal","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaTerminal","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"AlphaTerminal","score":26,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AIテキストジェネレーターで遊んでみましたが、出てきたのはマーケットに勝つための一攫千金の本を売ろうとするこの記事でした。","the_new_excerpt":"タイトルにあるように、私がInferKitを知ったのは、この/r/slatestarcodexの投稿からです。\n愉快なAIが生成したピューリタンの名前\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/prgvwa/aigenerated_puritan_names/]\nそして彼らの無料デモ[https://app.inferkit.com/demo]を試してみました。\n\nまずは以下のようにしてみました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我玩了一个人工智能文本生成器，我得到的是这篇文章，它试图销售一本击败市场的快速致富书。","the_new_excerpt":"正如标题所言，我是从这个/r/slatestarcodex的帖子中了解到InferKit的。\n爆笑的AI生成的清教徒名字\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/prgvwa/aigenerated_puritan_names/]\n并给他们的免费演示[https://app.inferkit.com/demo]打了个电话。\n\n我从以下几个方面入手...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我玩了一個人工智能文本生成器，我得到的是這篇文章，它試圖銷售一本擊敗市場的快速致富書。","the_new_excerpt":"正如標題所言，我是從這個/r/slatestarcodex的帖子中瞭解到InferKit的。\n爆笑的AI生成的清教徒名字\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/prgvwa/aigenerated_puritan_names/]\n並給他們的免費演示[https://app.inferkit.com/demo]打了個電話。\n\n我從以下幾個方面入手...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ps3s07","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ps3s07/well_shit/","title":"Well, shit.","date":"September 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"まあ、クソ。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"嗯，该死。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"嗯，該死。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1440109954271154177","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1440109954271154177","title":"Are Evergrande’s debts denominated in Crypto? https://t.co/YAoqBVx2Rk","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 21, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"Evergrandeの負債はCryptoで建てられているのか？https://t.co/YAoqBVx2Rk","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"恒大的债务是以加密货币计价的吗？https://t.co/YAoqBVx2Rk","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"恆大的債務是以加密貨幣計價的嗎？https://t.co/YAoqBVx2Rk","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ps1ali","previousId":"RedditPost-ps3s07","nextId":"TweetPost-1440109954271154177","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ps1ali/i_played_with_an_ai_text_generator_and_all_i_got/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
