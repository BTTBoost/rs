We know exactly how much he sells each day since he needs to file those numbers to the SEC. You can find them here: <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings\">click</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the proof he is really selling as announced.</p>\n\n<p>You may check this article to see its legit:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389</a></p>\n\n<h1>How it is going:</h1>\n\n<p>I found this graphic on Twitter which visualizes his sales in relation to the performance of the Tesla share price: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RawBooty2/status/1459121681549733893\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>This shows that Elons sales continously move the price downwards. Please note that the graphic wasnt updated for fridays sales yet. I will update it as soon as its available.</p>\n\n<h1>Now the interesting part We know how many shares he still has to sell !</h1>\n\n<p>It is 17,3m shares (10% of 172,6m) minus what has been sold already.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So that is 11,4m shares left for sale</strong> since we know from SEC files he sold 4,9m shares until friday.</p>\n\n<p>I copied all the SEC files in one Excel document and calculated the sales volumes.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>If we assume he will continue to sell 500 - 639k shares a day as he did the last three days that means <strong>he will be selling for another 18-23 trading days</strong>. Which would be 8th dec - 15th dec</p>\n\n<p>So how do we use this knowledge ?</p>\n\n<p>Well I assume and the chart proves it that the buyers will not be willing to jump in front of the bus while Elon dumps his shares. So there is a really good chance we see lower prices until he is done.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately i cant include pictures in this post. I will give you guys a link to a post with pictures in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>There was a rise in SP on Wednesday but he filed his first SEC report on Wednesday evening.</p>\n\n<p>So ever since it is public knowledge that he <strong>really</strong> started selling and how much he sells it was going down.</p>\n\n<h1>How to play it:</h1>\n\n<p>I see several possibilities to take profit from this knowledge</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hold puts until Elon is almost done</li>\n<li>Sell a part of holding now and buy it back later at lower prices (some say thats what EMusk might intend to do)</li>\n<li>Hold puts until Elon is done and reinvest your gains in calls</li>\n<li>Look at the daily patterns, caused by Elons broker dumping shares</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Again, i cant post pictures here. I will include the link to the pictured post in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>You might notice that each day from Wednesday to Friday starts with a dip and then a mini rally which peaks between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM. Followed by descending prices through the day.</p>\n\n<p>Currently i am holding puts which i bought last monday and wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>I am no financial advisor and please dont regard this as any form of advice or recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>Please do your own due dilligence!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qtzgu6/extraordinary_market_situation_for_tesla_tsla/","title":"Extraordinary market situation for Tesla (TSLA) right now.
