The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said.  Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. </p>\n\n<p>If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesday’s close. </p>\n\n<p>Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didi’s biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo. Deliberations continue and it’s possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Didi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July. </p>\n\n<p>It’s possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijing’s municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares. </p>\n\n<p>Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company’s U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies Inc. are Didi’s biggest minority shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>Even if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag.\nRead more about Didi’s brushes with Beijing regulators</p>\n\n<p>Regulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the world’s largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms’ books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.</p>\n\n<p>Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinping’s administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or “common prosperity,” has targeted an internet sector that’s accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.</p>\n\n<p>A state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didi’s stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the country’s internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in China’s largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc. </p>\n\n<p>Beijing’s moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi’s IPO decision as a challenge to the central government’s authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi’s offices in July.</p>\n\n<p>It’s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that’s traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r2m6n2/china_asks_didi_to_delist_from_us_on_security/","title":"China Asks Didi to Delist From U.S. On Security Fears","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-26T23:07:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-26 23:07","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r2m6n2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r2m6n2/china_asks_didi_to_delist_from_us_on_security/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r2m6n2/china_asks_didi_to_delist_from_us_on_security/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Spirited-Pause","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spirited-Pause","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Spirited-Pause","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"中国、安全保障上の懸念からDidi社に米国からの撤退を要請","the_new_excerpt":"https://archive.md/20211126053013/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-26/china-is-said-to-ask-didi-to-delist-from-u-s-on-security-fears\n\n中国の規制当局は、Didi Global Inc.のトップに、米国証券取引所からの上場廃止計画を策定するよう要請した。\n中国の規制当局は、Didi Global Inc.の経営陣に対し、米国の証券取引所からの上場廃止計画を策定するよう要請したとのことです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"中国因担心安全问题要求滴滴出行从美国退市","the_new_excerpt":"https://archive.md/20211126053013/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-26/china-is-said-to-ask-didi-to-delist-from-u-s-on-security-fears\n\n中国监管机构已要求滴滴全球公司的高管们制定一个计划，以从美国退市。\n熟悉此事的人士称，滴滴全球公司的高管已经要求他们制定一个从美国证券市场退市的计划，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中國因擔心安全問題要求滴滴出行從美國退市","the_new_excerpt":"https://archive.md/20211126053013/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-26/china-is-said-to-ask-didi-to-delist-from-u-s-on-security-fears\n\n中國監管機構已要求滴滴全球公司的高管們制定一個計劃，以從美國退市。\n熟悉此事的人士稱，滴滴全球公司的高管已經要求他們制定一個從美國證券市場退市的計劃，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r2pbv0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2pbv0/waking_up_to_check_how_much_money_my_spy_calls/","title":"Waking up to check how much money my SPY calls are worth","date":"November 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SPYのコールの価値を確認するために起床する","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"醒来查看我的SPY看涨期权值多少钱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"醒來查看我的SPY看漲期權值多少錢","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-r2xdc2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2xdc2/the_stock_market_today_be_like/","title":"The Stock Market Today Be Like","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 26, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今日の株式市場はこんな感じ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"今天的股票市场就像","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天的股票市場就像","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-r2m6n2","previousId":"RedditPost-r2pbv0","nextId":"RedditPost-r2xdc2","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r2m6n2/china_asks_didi_to_delist_from_us_on_security/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
