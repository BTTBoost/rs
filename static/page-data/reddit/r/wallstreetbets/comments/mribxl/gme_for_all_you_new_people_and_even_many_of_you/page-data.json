I bought in around $100, have been constantly buying more over time, and have held from $350 to today&#39;s price (currently $156).  I will continue to buy/hold.  I&#39;m not here to give you a floor, but I can sure as hell guarantee you that I&#39;m not selling my shares anywhere near 1k.</p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t lie to y&#39;all, I originally bought in solely for the squeeze potential, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here anymore.  We don&#39;t know if the squeeze will squooze, but what we do know is that we will profit handsomely if we&#39;re patient.  Let&#39;s go over a few things:</p>\n\n<p><strong>(1) No one knows the short interest (SI).  There are zero reliable sources for SI data.  Everything that you see is entirely speculation.  Therefore, no one knows if shorts have covered or fucking quintupled down or worse.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(2) If we are truly a part of one of the most heinous financial conspiracies that the world has even seen, I guarantee you the MOASS will NOT occur until the proper safeguards are in place, i.e. NSCC/DTCC/OCC regulations.  If the market can be manipulated to fuck retail, it can be manipulated to delay a MOASS until certain measures are in place.  These regulations may not be fully approved for 2-3 months.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>(3) Gamestop, led by Ryan Cohen, is beginning a fundamental transformation.   They paid off their debt.  They&#39;re replacing nearly all of their top level execs.  They&#39;re forming an e-commerce company with people who were part of building some of the most successful e-commerce companies in existence. If/when this transformation is successful, it could result in GME&#39;s price reaching more than $1000 in the next 1-3 years or so.  This is completely independent of any squeeze.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>I believe that illegal market manipulation is taking place, there&#39;s a ridiculous amount of short interest, the MOASS will eventually occur, and on top of that the Gamestop transformation will be wildly successful.  I don&#39;t know when the MOASS could happen.  I can&#39;t possibly estimate a floor since I don&#39;t know the real short interest.  What I do know is that this is the best investment opportunity that I&#39;ve ever seen and here&#39;s the best way to think about this play:</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you believe in the transformation thesis, this should be the easiest investment play of your life.  Some of us bought in a $4, $40, or even $400.  Let&#39;s assume most people&#39;s average share price is $200.  So if the price were to get to $1000, then you&#39;ve made 5x your initial investment.  That&#39;s fucking insane.  You can&#39;t go anywhere in the world and find a (legal and cheap buy in) investment opportunity that has a pretty damn good chance of giving you a 5x return and all you have to do is wait a few years.</li>\n<li>If the MOASS occurs, and the majority of people believe in (1), then one would assume that those people will hold to far beyond low $XXXX.  Why wouldn&#39;t you?  You believe that the price is going to get near there relatively soon anyway.  Again, I&#39;m not here to set a floor, but if GME squeezes, I will say that I won&#39;t sell below $XXXXX, and I&#39;d hope that even the most paper handed of apes wouldn&#39;t either.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So to reiterate: even if there is no squeeze, even if all the shorts have covered, even if some demonic intervention takes place and fucks over retail letting the shorters escape, if you hold, there&#39;s a very good chance that you&#39;re going to get make a ridiculous return.  I&#39;d love to be a part of this transformation, and I&#39;m more than happy to wait for my tendies.</p>\n\n<p>🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  <strong>💎🙌🏼</strong>  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mribxl/gme_for_all_you_new_people_and_even_many_of_you/","title":"GME: For all you new people, and even many of you veterans, let me explain how you win this fight.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"April 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-15T18:55:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-15 18:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3431f70d-c499-5f84-95e7-677ecbc0cca5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mribxl/gme_for_all_you_new_people_and_even_many_of_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mribxl/gme_for_all_you_new_people_and_even_many_of_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"the_fucking_doctor","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_fucking_doctor","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"the_fucking_doctor","score":3756,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GMEです。初めての方、そしてベテランの方のために、この戦いにどうやって勝つのかを説明しましょう。","the_new_excerpt":"私はファイナンシャル・アドバイザーではありませんし、これは財務上のアドバイスではありません。\n\n私はGMEにかなりのポジションを持っています。私は100ドル前後で購入し、時間をかけて常に買い足してきました。\n350ドルから今日の価格（現在156ドル）まで保有しています。\n(現在156ドル)まで保有しています。これからも買い/持ち続けます。私は床を与えるためにここにいるのではありません。\nしかし、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"GME。让我来解释一下你们是如何赢得这场战斗的。","the_new_excerpt":"我不是财务顾问，这也不是财务建议。\n\n我在GME有很大的仓位。我在100元左右买入，一直\n随着时间的推移不断地买入更多的东西，从350美元一直持有到今天的价格。\n目前为156美元）。我将继续买入/持有。我不是来给你下限的。\n但我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME。讓我來解釋一下你們是如何贏得這場戰鬥的。","the_new_excerpt":"我不是財務顧問，這也不是財務建議。\n\n我在GME有很大的倉位。我在100元左右買入，一直\n隨着時間的推移不斷地買入更多的東西，從350美元一直持有到今天的價格。\n目前爲156美元）。我將繼續買入/持有。我不是來給你下限的。\n但我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-fd4590c0-8bc1-57aa-af03-fc5f2e001d8f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrgjhs/zero_is_not_the_lowest_you_can_go_people/","title":"Zero is not the lowest you can go people!","date":"April 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ゼロは最低ではありません。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"零点不是你能做到的最低限度的人!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"零點不是你能做到的最低限度的人!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1382761887411032065","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1382761887411032065","title":"The used market for goods is going to be enormous in like 12-18 months\n\nThings ppl panic bought during the pandemic that will end up for sale:\n\n-2nd homes\n-boats/jet skis\n-dumbbells/home gyms\n-trampolines\n\nFeels like a buyer's market is coming at some point\n\nWhat am I missing?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"April 15, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"12～18ヶ月後には、商品の中古市場は膨大なものになるだろう。\n\nパンデミック中に人々がパニックになって買ったもので、売りに出されることになるもの。\n\n-2つ目の家\n-ボート/ジェットスキー\n-ダンベル/ホームジム\n-トランポリン\n\nいずれは買い手市場になると感じている。\n\n私に足りないものは？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"在12-18个月内，二手商品市场将是巨大的。\n\n疫情期间人们恐慌性买的东西，最后都会被卖掉。\n\n-第二套房子\n-船只/水上摩托艇\n-哑铃/家庭健身房\n-蹦床\n\n感觉买方市场在某个时间点会到来\n\n我错过了什么？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"在12-18個月內，二手商品市場將是巨大的。\n\n疫情期間人們恐慌性買的東西，最後都會被賣掉。\n\n-第二套房子\n-船隻/水上摩托艇\n-啞鈴/家庭健身房\n-蹦牀\n\n感覺買方市場在某個時間點會到來\n\n我錯過了什麼？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-3431f70d-c499-5f84-95e7-677ecbc0cca5","previousId":"RedditPost-fd4590c0-8bc1-57aa-af03-fc5f2e001d8f","nextId":"TweetPost-1382761887411032065","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mribxl/gme_for_all_you_new_people_and_even_many_of_you/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
