The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, traded mostly even, closing the day 0.22% higher. Like I have been saying for weeks now, while I remain bullish I expect a lot of choppiness in the market moving forward. In my view, there are a variety of contending factors affecting the market, including but not limited to: (1) record corporate earnings, (2) Senate’s passage of the infrastructure bill, (3) improving labor market, (4) rising concerns surrounding the delta variant, (5) concerns around inflation, (6) regulatory concerns in China.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the price of oil rebounded from a three week low, with the market hoping that the resilient demand from the West may offset weak demand from China. Yesterday, oil prices tumbled due to concerns that the latest outbreak of COVID in China would trigger a swift response from the government, which has been so far extremely aggressive in battling the virus. China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 146 new infections as of Monday - the fourth straight day it reported 90 cases and above and the second day it has reported over 100 cases. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. </p>\n\n<p>While those numbers are very small compared to the US, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called “zero-COVID” approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is possible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, the CCP has ordered mass testing in areas of high transmission, re-implemented extensive lockdowns, enacted new travel restrictions within the country, and extended the closure of its borders to foreign travelers. As of yesterday, at least 47 officials have been punished for “negligence”, according to state reports. </p>\n\n<p>Shockingly, we actually have some good news coming out of Congress. The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The 2020 Olympics concluded and were a wild disappointment, with ratings experiencing a 42% decline compared to the 2016 Olympics. </li>\n<li>Wild ride in AMC today. Shares gapped up more than 10% premarket before falling throughout the session to close the day -6% down, a 16% intraday swing. </li>\n<li>According to a new report by the Department of Labor, worker productivity grew at a slower-than-expected pace in Q2. Nonfarm productivity grew at a 2.3% annualized rate, down from 4.3% pace in Q1</li>\n<li>Pepsi (PEP) partnered with Boston Beer (SAM) to produce an alcoholic rendition of the popular soda Mountain Dew. Product expected to be on the shelves by early 2022</li>\n<li>DraftKings (DKNG) announced a content partnership with Autograph, an NFT company founded by NFL superstar Tom Brady. Matt Kalish, DKNG President said, “Autograph’s Advisory Board includes some of the most iconic athletes ever and we could not imagine a more fitting figure than Tom Brady to headline our first ever NFT drop on DraftKings Marketplace.” A lot of activity has been coming from DKNG recently. </li>\n<li>Tesla sold 32,968 China-made cars, including those for export, according tyo the China Passenger Car Association. </li>\n<li>Upstart (UPST), one of my fav fin-tech stocks that I’ve been holding for a while popped off after earnings, up more than 15%. I’m very happy about that :)</li>\n<li>Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said he is “trying to build the most forward-thinking sports gambling company”. This comes on the backs of Penn’s (who owns 36% of Barstool) acquired Score Media, the leading sports content app in Canada and third largest in the US. I think this is a very interesting partnership between all companies.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $205 to $210 at Overweight.
