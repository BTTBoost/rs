Despite fears surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant and potential inflationary pressures, it seems those risk factors were quickly priced in by the market, an encouraging sign that market participants continue to believe in the recovery of the economy and eagerly buy up any dips. Potential risks will always be present in the market, and one always has to be prepared to act in case of a downturn, but one shouldn’t make decisions based on fear. We have seen dips like this in the past before the year, yet the three main indexes continue their monster uptrend. In other news, Q2 earnings season continues and is shaping up to be another record-breaking season! Bond yields also continue to decline, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield falling close to pre-pandemic levels, a sign that market participants are increasingly less worried about inflation. </p>\n\n<p>Earnings season continued full steam ahead, with bellwethers Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), and Verizon (VZ) all topping estimates, an encouraging sign that, despite tech-stocks being the market’s driver, fundamental value stocks are also growing. Netflix (NFLX) continued its multi-month streak of volatility, underperforming the market after reporting disappointing earnings, despite gaining more paid subscribers than expected. Chipotle (CMG) smashed passed estimates thanks to customers returning to the restaurant and continued strength in digital sales. </p>\n\n<p>On Monday, it seems fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant came to a head, with LA county reinstating its mask mandate and the Japanese government reportedly discussing potentially cancelling the Olympics after a slew of infections among athletes and staff. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.</p>\n\n<p>it’s unclear how the situation will play out, but I continue to urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. </p>\n\n<p>Q2 earnings season is shaping up to another record-setting quarter, similar to Q1 of this year. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS&#39;s Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be &quot;need to be revised higher.&quot; </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Today, Cathie Woods, CEO of ARK Investments, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square (SQ) and Twitter (TWTR), and Elon Musk, Tesla (TSLA) CEO met today in a conference in order to discuss how digital currencies may be used in the future. I encourage people to check it out, it was very entertaining to see. </li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) underperformed the market today due to intense flooding in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, which is home to the largest iPhone assembly plant.</li>\n<li>Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year. At first, there will be a safety driver behind the wheel but reportedly want fully automated robotaxis by 2022 or 2023.</li>\n<li>Microsoft (MSFT) bought start-up CloduKnox, whose software helps companies better monitor and reduce the amount of access they provide to their cloud resources. This is another in a long-line of recent acquisitions made by Microsoft aimed to bolstered their cybersecurity following a slew of recent high profile attacks.</li>\n<li>Cash on corporate balance sheets has reached an all-time high, with companies in the S&amp;P 500 holding $1.9 trillion in cash, which gives them plenty of runway to issue buyback programs, increase dividends, and invest in the business</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Ally Financial (ALLY) with three target raises.
