At least 6,000 Coinbase customers had funds removed from their accounts, including you.  </p>\n\n<p>In order to access your Coinbase account, these third parties first needed prior knowledge of the email address, password, and phone number associated with your Coinbase account, as well as access to your personal email inbox. While we are not able to determine conclusively how these third parties gained access to this information, this type of campaign typically involves phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to trick a victim into unknowingly disclosing login credentials to a bad actor. We have not found any evidence that these third parties obtained this information from Coinbase itself.  </p>\n\n<p>Even with the information described above, additional authentication is required in order to access your Coinbase account. However, in this incident, for customers who use SMS texts for two-factor authentication, the third party took advantage of a flaw in Coinbase’s SMS Account Recovery process in order to receive an SMS two-factor authentication token and gain access to your account.  </p>\n\n<p>Once in your account, the third party was able to transfer your funds to crypto wallets unassociated with Coinbase.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From a shareholder perspective, I think this is very egregious that this was happening around the time of the IPO, but they didn&#39;t disclose this until just now. This news was withheld and kept under wraps for months, and could be related to the heavy selling we&#39;ve seen from company executives since the IPO back in April.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzf6af/coinbase_hacked_funds_from_least_6000_customers/","title":"Coinbase Hacked, Funds From Least 6,000 Customers Wiped Out","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-01T23:55:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-01 23:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pzf6af","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzf6af/coinbase_hacked_funds_from_least_6000_customers/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pzf6af/coinbase_hacked_funds_from_least_6000_customers/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ShotBot","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShotBot","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ShotBot","score":216,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Coinbaseがハッキングされ、少なくとも6,000人の顧客の資金が消される","the_new_excerpt":"影響を受けたCoinbaseのお客様は、今朝このメールを受け取りました。\n\n残念ながら、2021年3月から5月20日までの間に、お客様は不正アクセスを目的とした > 第三者によるキャンペーンの被害に遭いました。\n> コインベースのお客様の口座に不正にアクセスして、お客様の資金を\n> のお客様の口座に不正にアクセスし、お客様の資金をCoinbaseプラットフォームから移動させようとする第三者のキャンペーンの犠牲になりました。少なくとも、6,000\n>...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Coinbase遭黑客攻击，至少6,000名客户的资金被抹去了","the_new_excerpt":"受影响的Coinbase客户今天早上收到了这封邮件。\n\n> 不幸的是，在2021年3月至5月20日期间，你是一个受害者。\n> 第三方活动，未经授权进入Coinbase的账户\n> 客户的账户，并将客户的资金从Coinbase平台上转移出去。至少有6,000\n>...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coinbase遭黑客攻擊，至少6,000名客戶的資金被抹去了","the_new_excerpt":"受影響的Coinbase客戶今天早上收到了這封郵件。\n\n> 不幸的是，在2021年3月至5月20日期間，你是一個受害者。\n> 第三方活動，未經授權進入Coinbase的賬戶\n> 客戶的賬戶，並將客戶的資金從Coinbase平臺上轉移出去。至少有6,000\n>...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pz9xvl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pz9xvl/sec_reportedly_looking_into_robinhood_execs_sell/","title":"SEC reportedly looking into Robinhood Execs sell off of AMC, Fox Business","date":"October 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SECがRobinhood ExecsによるAMC、Fox Businessの売却を調査していると報じられた。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"据报道，美国证券交易委员会正在调查Robinhood执行官出售AMC、Fox Business的情况","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"據報道，美國證券交易委員會正在調查Robinhood執行官出售AMC、Fox Business的情況","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pzhh18","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzhh18/1000_spy_bet_paidopponent_true_wallstbets_member/","title":"$1000 spy bet Paid..Opponent true wallstbets member","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 02, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"1000ドルスパイベット有料...対戦相手真のwallstbetsメンバー","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"1000美元间谍赌注已付......对手是真正的wallstbets会员","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"1000美元間諜賭注已付......對手是真正的wallstbets會員","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pzf6af","previousId":"RedditPost-pz9xvl","nextId":"RedditPost-pzhh18","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pzf6af/coinbase_hacked_funds_from_least_6000_customers/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
