And both threads recommended the same financial advisor.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to see the comments, here are screenshots:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://gyazo.com/5aac77d78ba8a42cab46a7d72358b947\">https://gyazo.com/5aac77d78ba8a42cab46a7d72358b947</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://gyazo.com/d15510728c3ce438ddc9e991c6b8f180\">https://gyazo.com/d15510728c3ce438ddc9e991c6b8f180</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How the comment thread goes:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The original comment and the first and second reply follow the exact same script</li>\n<li>The third reply is saying to get professional advice from a financial advisor and they end telling how successful they&#39;ve been</li>\n<li>Fourth reply asking for the third commenters financial advisor</li>\n<li>The fifth reply is &quot;third reply guy&quot; telling them the name of the advisor and to go to their website</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>I google the name of the financial advisor:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First link is brokercheck.finra (a place to find if a person is a registered to sell securities). Everything seems to be in order at least to my untrained eye.</li>\n<li>Second is her website. Her website is very simple, only a single page, but looks professionally made. Seems pretty legit to me on first look. Even includes pictures of her.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Few things I found weird that makes me think it&#39;s a scam:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I can&#39;t find any other source that this person exists. No social media or anything else that would prove her existence.</li>\n<li>On her website and brokercheck.finra it says she has worked for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated since 1998, but on Merill Lynch&#39;s site (<a href=\"https://www.ml.com/\">www.ml.com</a>) you can&#39;t find her in their &quot;Find an advisor&quot; search.</li>\n<li>The comments promoting her, all the commenters are quite new accounts and have been made the same day or the day before each other. (They look like bought/bot accounts to me)</li>\n<li>Her website domain is very new and registrated only 6 months ago (<a href=\"https://www.urlvoid.com/scan/jenniferlynnfranciosa.com/\">https://www.urlvoid.com/scan/jenniferlynnfranciosa.com/</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not a financial advisor nor is this financial advice, just found something that in my eye looks like a scam. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the key takeaway from this, maybe to not trust everything you see on the internet as it may not be a real person commenting and might just be made up entirely.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/odp8d7/possible_scam_in_the_comments_of_stock_related/","title":"Possible scam in the comments of stock related videos","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-04T21:23:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-04 21:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f6731ae3-0d03-55dd-a5d4-53d15b864129","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/odp8d7/possible_scam_in_the_comments_of_stock_related/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/odp8d7/possible_scam_in_the_comments_of_stock_related/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"PakettiPake","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/PakettiPake","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"PakettiPake","score":333,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"株式関連動画のコメント欄での詐欺の可能性","the_new_excerpt":"youtubeで株式市場の暴落についての動画を見ていて、ある動画では\nあるビデオに興味を惹かれるものがあったので、調査してみました。\n調べることにしました。\n\n2つの異なるアカウントによるコメントスレッドがあり、それらはほぼ完全にコピーされていました。\n2つのコメントスレッドがあったのですが、どちらのスレッドも最後は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在股票相关视频的评论中可能存在的骗局","the_new_excerpt":"所以我在看Youtube上关于股市崩溃的视频，在其中一段\n在一个特定的视频中发现了一些东西，引起了我的兴趣，让我做了一些\n调查工作。\n\n有两个不同账户的评论线程，几乎完全复制了对方。\n互相复制，而在这两个评论中，它的结局是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在股票相關視頻的評論中可能存在的騙局","the_new_excerpt":"所以我在看Youtube上關於股市崩潰的視頻，在其中一段\n在一個特定的視頻中發現了一些東西，引起了我的興趣，讓我做了一些\n調查工作。\n\n有兩個不同賬戶的評論線程，幾乎完全複製了對方。\n互相複製，而在這兩個評論中，它的結局是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f20946ca-cbed-5748-9fc2-b491ccbe98a8","excerpt":"There are signs everywhere that a huge crash is coming and it'll take years for\nthe market to recover.
