For those of you who don’t know what they mean by “wholesale prices,” this is the price increase of bulk goods and services businesses use to make their end product or service. As to how bad this is … I’ve never seen anything like this in my lifetime. Inflation data comes out tomorrow. … which will likely be amplified by today’s Producer Price Index. Two of the big drivers were gasoline and the cost of autos. </p>\n\n<p>The big takeaway for today is that businesses are paying more for the wholesale goods they need to operate and this will likely be reflected in the CPI tomorrow. In short, the companies you are invested in will need to contend with higher input prices by increasing the cost of goods and services (or reinvesting to become more efficient) which will in turn result in the less people can afford to buy on a limited income. If this hits a tipping point where wages are increasing slowly with inflation increasing quickly, people with limited wages will be forced to buy their needs at higher prices and budget on the want side, resulting in less sales of goods people can go without.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qq53vw/wholesale_prices_rise_86_year_over_year_in/","title":"Wholesale prices rise 8.6% year over year in October, tied for highest ever","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-09T15:27:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-09 15:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qq53vw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qq53vw/wholesale_prices_rise_86_year_over_year_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qq53vw/wholesale_prices_rise_86_year_over_year_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"StockTipsTips","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/StockTipsTips","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"StockTipsTips","score":147,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"10月の卸売物価は前年同月比8.6％上昇し、過去最高タイとなる","the_new_excerpt":"10月の卸売物価は前年同月比8.6％上昇、過去最高タイに\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/wholesale-prices-rise-8point6percent-year-over-year-in-october-tied-for-highest-ever.html]\n\n投入価格は確実に上昇している。卸売りの意味がわからない人のために\n卸売価格」の意味を知らない人のために","locale":"ja"},{"title":"10月份批发价格同比上涨8.6%，并列历史最高水平","the_new_excerpt":"10月份批发价格同比上涨8.6%，并列历史最高水平\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/wholesale-prices-rise-8point6percent-year-over-year-in-october-tied-for-highest-ever.html]\n\n输入价格肯定在增加。对于那些不知道他们的\n意思是 \"批发\"。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"10月份批發價格同比上漲8.6%，並列歷史最高水平","the_new_excerpt":"10月份批發價格同比上漲8.6%，並列歷史最高水平\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/wholesale-prices-rise-8point6percent-year-over-year-in-october-tied-for-highest-ever.html]\n\n輸入價格肯定在增加。對於那些不知道他們的\n意思是 \"批發\"。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qpz1g4","excerpt":"hi,\n\nwhat's the biggest mistakes or events that can destroy your wealth once you've\nreached your number?\nIn other words the best and intelligent way to preserve your wealth.\n\nThanks guys","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qpz1g4/how_to_not_get_rich_twice/","title":"how to not get rich twice ?","date":"November 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"二度金持ちにならないためには？","the_new_excerpt":"をご覧ください。\n\nあなたが自分の番号に到達した後に、あなたの富を破壊する最大の間違いや出来事は何ですか？\n到達した後に富を失う最大の失敗や出来事は何ですか？\n言い換えれば、あなたの富を維持するための最良で知的な方法です。\n\nありがとうございます。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如何不致于两次致富？","the_new_excerpt":"嗨。\n\n一旦你达到了你的数字，什么是最大的错误或事件可以摧毁你的财富？\n达到你的数字？\n换句话说，就是保存你的财富的最佳和明智的方法。\n\n谢谢大家","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何不致於兩次致富？","the_new_excerpt":"嗨。\n\n一旦你達到了你的數字，什麼是最大的錯誤或事件可以摧毀你的財富？\n達到你的數字？\n換句話說，就是保存你的財富的最佳和明智的方法。\n\n謝謝大家","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qpmz06","excerpt":"Some research I have been doing on Cleveland-Cliffs\n\nThey are the largest and the cleanest steel producers in the United States.\n\nBecame very profitable this year, particularly Q3\n\nPosted 6 billion in revenue and just under 1.3 billion in profits for a single\nquarter\n\nThis is about 10 to 11% net…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qpmz06/clf_sleeping_giant/","title":"CLF - sleeping Giant","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 09, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CLF - スリーピング・ジャイアント","the_new_excerpt":"Cleveland-Cliffs社について調べてみました。\n\n米国で最大かつ最もクリーンな鉄鋼メーカーです。\n\n今年、特に第3四半期は非常に高い利益を上げた\n\n売上高は60億円、利益は13億円弱を計上しました。\n四半期\n\nこれは約10～11％の純...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"CLF - 沉睡的巨人","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在做关于克利夫兰-克利夫的一些研究\n\n他们是美国最大和最清洁的钢铁生产商。\n\n今年变得非常有利可图，特别是第三季度\n\n单个季度的收入为60亿，利润略低于13亿\n季度\n\n这大约是10％至11％的净...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CLF - 沉睡的巨人","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在做關於克利夫蘭-克利夫的一些研究\n\n他們是美國最大和最清潔的鋼鐵生產商。\n\n今年變得非常有利可圖，特別是第三季度\n\n單個季度的收入爲60億，利潤略低於13億\n季度\n\n這大約是10％至11％的淨...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qq53vw","previousId":"RedditPost-qpz1g4","nextId":"RedditPost-qpmz06","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qq53vw/wholesale_prices_rise_86_year_over_year_in/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
