This fucking guy had 5:1 leverage on $16 billion of capital invested in china growth/tech <em>at the peak of the fucking tech surge</em>, and <em>didn&#39;t fucking de-leverage</em> during the most obvious sector rotation ever 6 weeks ago. It&#39;s all gone now. Liquidated. To zero. He was heavy into china tech / growth stocks on 5x margin, $80 billion portfolio. Poof. </p>\n\n<p>Margin calls probably started on Monday of last week, where forced liquidation took place. Rumor has it, all of the different PB&#39;s this guy borrowed margin from agreed to an orderly selloff during the forced liquidation, but some unknown PB front ran them like a total cocksucking wench and liquidated all at once, causing a violent crash in BIDU and Viacom.
