The company has great P/S ratio, bad P/E, but I don&#39;t mind when the company is growing and spends a lot in R&amp;D + Marketing making the &quot;E&quot; smaller.</p>\n\n<p>However, the cost of revenue of Square seems very high for an internet company. Also, it is trending higher and higher. In 2020, they made 13.17B of revenue (very good), but 10B of cost of revenue (ouch).</p>\n\n<p>Gross profit margin:</p>\n\n<p>2018: 40%</p>\n\n<p>2019: 40%</p>\n\n<p>2020: 28.7%</p>\n\n<p>Q1 2021: 19%</p>\n\n<p>Like the more revenue the company is making, the more expensive gets the Cost of revenue? It is the opposite of economy of scale. It leaves way less money to spend in R&amp;D, marketing, or just the cash on hand. With the current price, it is like if investors believe that the revenues will hit 40/50B in few years. I believe that it can happen, but rather in over 10 years...</p>\n\n<p>Because of that, I feel that the company is becoming grossly overvalued, and I plan to sell my shares in a near future. The earning potential seems reduced + Covid accelerator is done. The growth in 2022 will be less in my opinion.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o4kiys/who_squares_has_such_a_high_cost_of_revenue/","title":"Who Square's has such a high cost of revenue?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-21T21:06:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-21 21:06","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3597fd24-71c0-555b-870a-a4006c4b6ed0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o4kiys/who_squares_has_such_a_high_cost_of_revenue/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o4kiys/who_squares_has_such_a_high_cost_of_revenue/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"GuiBz123","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GuiBz123","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GuiBz123","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Who Square'sはこんなに収益コストが高いのか？","the_new_excerpt":"理由\n\nスクエアの株を持っているが、業績はいいが、Cost of Revenueが高いのが気になる。\nコストオブレベニューの高さが気になっている。この会社のP/S比は素晴らしいが、PERは悪い。\nしかし、会社が成長していて、研究開発やマーケティングに多額の費用をかけていて、\"E \"が小さくても気にならない。\nを小さくすることができます。\n\nしかし、スクウェアの売上原価は...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"谁家的广场有这么高的收入成本？","the_new_excerpt":"为什么*？\n\n我确实持有Square的股票，表现很好，但我开始担心他们的\n高收入成本。该公司有很好的P/S比率，糟糕的P/E，但我并不介意\n但我不介意该公司正在增长，并在研发和营销方面花了很多钱，使 \"E \"变小。\n较小。\n\n然而，Square的收入成本似乎...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰家的廣場有這麼高的收入成本？","the_new_excerpt":"爲什麼*？\n\n我確實持有Square的股票，表現很好，但我開始擔心他們的\n高收入成本。該公司有很好的P/S比率，糟糕的P/E，但我並不介意\n但我不介意該公司正在增長，並在研發和營銷方面花了很多錢，使 \"E \"變小。\n較小。\n\n然而，Square的收入成本似乎...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2cecdd13-676a-5481-a061-85e4d59b87b0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4yd4v/half_of_my_life_savings_in_wish_lets_gooooo_apes/","title":"Half of my life savings in $wish let’s gooooo apes","date":"June 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"貯金の半分を$wishに入れて、Let's goooo apes","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我半生的积蓄都用在了愿望上，我们走吧，猿猴。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我半生的積蓄都用在了願望上，我們走吧，猿猴。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-21e584a5-d579-5954-af0e-89921ec4464a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4whqr/wish_stock_ready_to_fly_calling_all_apes/","title":"WISH stock ready to FLY .
