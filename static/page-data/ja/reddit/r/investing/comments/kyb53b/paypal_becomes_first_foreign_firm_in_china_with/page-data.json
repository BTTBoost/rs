The stake purchase came a year after PayPal bought a 70% stake in GoPay for an undisclosed amount，then becoming the first foreign company licensed to provide online payment services in China.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>PayPal declined to comment.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>In taking full control of one of the smaller players in the world’s largest payment market, PayPal will compete with domestic payments giants Alipay, owned by Alibaba-affiliated Ant Group, and WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd, as China fully opens up its financial sector.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The stake purchase also comes amid Beijing’s antimonopoly campaign against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and other Internet companies.  </p>\n\n<p>Last August, PayPal appointed Hannah Qiu as head of China business, responsible for formulating long-term strategy in the world’s second-biggest economy. Qiu was a former executive at insurer Ping An Group’s fintech unit OneConnect, according to PayPal’s website.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/china-paypal-stake/paypal-becomes-first-foreign-firm-in-china-with-full-ownership-of-payments-business-idUSL4N2JP14M\">Reuters</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","title":"PayPal becomes first foreign firm in China with full ownership of payments business","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T10:08:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 10:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c87e161d-0dde-5e6a-8201-ee5742ebf269","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kyb53b/paypal_becomes_first_foreign_firm_in_china_with/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":803,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"PayPal成为中国首家拥有支付业务全部所有权的外资企业","the_new_excerpt":"我很惊讶这个没有发布，因为它似乎很有新闻价值，所以几个\n我想，晚几天总比不晚好。\n\n> 上海（路透社）--PayPal Holding Inc已成为第一家外国运营商。\n>拥有中国支付平台100%的控制权，据中国的。\n>政府数据，作为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"PayPal成爲中國首家擁有支付業務全部所有權的外資企業","the_new_excerpt":"我很驚訝這個沒有發佈，因爲它似乎很有新聞價值，所以幾個\n我想，晚幾天總比不晚好。\n\n> 上海（路透社）--PayPal Holding Inc已成爲第一家外國運營商。\n>擁有中國支付平臺100%的控制權，據中國的。\n>政府數據，作爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e3e1e0ad-8528-5b48-b0b7-e543bfa4eb9b","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky8r2d/gme_going_to_the_moon_melvin_capital_gets_nutted/","title":"GME going to the moon, melvin capital gets nutted on","date":"January 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GME要上月球了，梅尔文资本被人盯上了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME要上月球了，梅爾文資本被人盯上了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-d709ea54-f1c6-550e-817f-c844e4e3ab1e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxxt0e/calling_on_all_autists_mobilize_your_buying_power/","title":"🚀 Calling On All Autists!
