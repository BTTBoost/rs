They&#39;ll likely select the following companies:\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$IRDM:</strong> vertically integrated, niche global connectivity provider of voice and low-throughput data services (176kbps - 704kps) to bulky proprietary satellite phones. Offers 100 minutes of voice and 100 text messages for $89.99 a month and has 1.6 Million subscribers globally.</li>\n<li><strong>$GSAT:</strong> they&#39;ll throw this vertically integrated old school satellite phone provider in the analysis, but it&#39;s not really comparable. GSAT has some interesting satellite spectrum that could be utilized for limited regional emergency phone connectivity in future handsets. However the company&#39;s satellites are old and need to be decommissioned and replaced with new satellites utilizing a similar approach that AST has patented (high powered, large phased array aperture satellites) to provide anything beyond emergency messaging services. GSAT offers various voice plans starting at $79.99 a month for 150 minutes and has 745,000 subscribers.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Take a look at both Iridium and Globalstar phones, which require large antennas and high power to connect to their respective satellites for voice and low-speed data services. AST’s satellites will allow you to use your current handset for voice and broadband internet!</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1hzjc1h9eoo71.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b780be9b64755f2b19be031183ae7003304faf0a\">https://preview.redd.it/1hzjc1h9eoo71.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b780be9b64755f2b19be031183ae7003304faf0a</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$AMT $CCI $SBAC:</strong> AMT is an investor and sits on the board of AST. AMT has made it clear that AST&#39;s technology could help reduce the need to build out expensive cellular towers in low density areas which could save telco partners significant future capital expenditure $. Once AST&#39;s constellation is up and running, the business model would be very similar to wireless tower companies like AMT/CCI/SBAC where they enter into long-term partnership agreements with telcos and provide the infrastructure (towers) that enable connectivity to subscribers.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tower companies enjoy long-term agreements and predictable cashflows, which have enabled many to convert to REITs as they pass along a steady stream of income to shareholders. Similarly, once AST has invested in deploying its constellation, aside from some minimal maintenance capex the cashflows will be substantial to the point where the AST will likely institute a dividend and/or return capital to shareholders via share buybacks.</li>\n<li>Here’s a video of AMT’s Chief Technology Officer talking about AST: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erDOlUoEmnc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erDOlUoEmnc</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/loxfvskgeoo71.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcd29da48bf96a69e8b95400a1e1590ef6aab050\">https://preview.redd.it/loxfvskgeoo71.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcd29da48bf96a69e8b95400a1e1590ef6aab050</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Probability Weighing the Outcome:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>So the douchebag analyst has put together valuation &quot;comps&quot;, using haircut public estimates and peer 2025E EBITDA multiples:\n\n<ul>\n<li>From this comparison, he can support <strong>$100 - $150 per share for AST if it is successful</strong></li>\n<li>Keep in mind that all of these comps exhibit much lower growth rates... if the company can execute the valuation multiple ascribed should be higher</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Now this is where qualitative due diligence is important. The douchebag analyst may talk to Deutsche Bank and Barclays research to get a feel for probabilities of success. They may also talk to the AST and read reddit posts like this one. <em>What&#39;s the probability for success here?</em></li>\n<li>Deutsche Bank takes an equal weighted approach of 25% for management case, 25% for DB case, 25% for conservative and 25% for zero. The douchebag analyst may take a similar approach:\n\n<ul>\n<li>33% chance of full success resulting in $100 or $150 price</li>\n<li>33% for partial success resulting in a $30 price. Maybe the service works but is slow or subscribers aren’t as quick to adopt the service … so you might end up with something like $IRDM, which is worth $6 billion</li>\n<li>33% of total failure resulting in $0. This is pretty punitive given the growing patent portfolio, but zero it is!</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Based on the valuation analysis above, this is what expected values might look like using forward 2025E EBITDA multiple discounted back 2 years by 15 discount rate to get to beginning of CY2022\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using $IRDM as a comparable: $32</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Using Tower Cos as comparables: $45</strong></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tb69ua6keoo71.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93269552f8e09dcdcc842e3e2e0c9feb53aef0ec\">https://preview.redd.it/tb69ua6keoo71.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93269552f8e09dcdcc842e3e2e0c9feb53aef0ec</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most institutions will likely ignore AST until we get within a few months from the scheduled March 2022 launch of BlueWalker-3 satellite aboard SpaceX.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Once BlueWalker-3 is successfully deployed, it will allow for full scale testing of AST’s technology and service ahead of Phase I deployment for equatorial coverage and service</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>However, once institutions and retail start to focus on this event the valuation exercise that I outlined above will be kicked off at generalist, event-driven, Tech/Media/Telecom and other douchebag hedge fund desks across the street</li>\n<li>These douches completing their valuation analyses will then lead to FOMO position building in anticipation of BlueWalker-3’s launch which should cause the stock to ramp (who is going to miss out on what could be the most disruptive company in wireless?!?!)\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, the effective float here is tiny at 36.9M shares once you remove the 9.2M held by strategics purchased via PIPE. Management and employees are locked up for 1 year\n\n<ul>\n<li>Although SPAC sponsor is locked up for 1 year as well, they are allowed to trade 33% of their shares (3.9M) if the stock price exceeds $12 for any 20 of 30 trading days at least 150 days after deal close</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>The stock currently sits at $11 vs. expected values of $32 to $45 at year end, where should it trade now? How about in 3 months?</strong></li>\n<li>I&#39;m a big believer in the company and the valuation outlined above is very conservative (using street estimates that take significant haircuts to management projections).</li>\n<li>I&#39;m one of a growing base of investors that continues to diligence AST and its opportunity as I underwrite my investment everyday. Even if you&#39;re skeptical of AST&#39;s probability of success, having a small position sized to zero can mean significant upside if it works!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mvjlshxreoo71.png?width=514&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8909a80fc0f65c039d37d93e8228a203d534375\">Chief SpaceMob Exec Abel Avellan</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I’ll close with Deutsche Bank highlighting AST’s potential:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tpa8d2qveoo71.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25fba71868cb301ddb90d0efcb6742a3aff21ce6\">https://preview.redd.it/tpa8d2qveoo71.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25fba71868cb301ddb90d0efcb6742a3aff21ce6</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Finally an update on my $3.7M position below:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yjc1rarxeoo71.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08e118560238c18276808eb495234f1bcb61068e\">The entire family is invested!</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prx4qw/asts_how_douchebag_hedge_fund_bros_will_value_ast/","title":"🚀📶 $ASTS How Douchebag Hedge Fund Bros Will Value AST SpaceMobile w/ $3.7M Position Update 📶🚀","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"September 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-20T19:35:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-20 19:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"prx4qw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prx4qw/asts_how_douchebag_hedge_fund_bros_will_value_ast/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prx4qw/asts_how_douchebag_hedge_fund_bros_will_value_ast/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"apan-man","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/apan-man","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"apan-man","score":1964,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"🚀📶 $ASTS How Douchebag Hedge Fund Bros Will Value AST SpaceMobile w/ $3.7M Position Update 📶 🚀","the_new_excerpt":"Douchebag Hedge Fund Analysts = Your Path to Tendies!\n\n * 今回は、同人のヘッジファンド・アナリストがどのようにして\n   とその仲間たちが、2022年3月の発売に向けて株価が上昇する中、10～20ドルのアップサイドを逃した後に、どのように$ASTSを分析するかを簡単に説明します。\n   2022年3月の\n   BlueWalker-3\n   *...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"🚀📶$ASTS Douchebag Hedge Fund Bros将如何评估AST SpaceMobile的价值和370万美元的头寸更新 📶🚀","the_new_excerpt":"恶棍式的对冲基金分析师=你通往天堂之路!\n\n * 我将简要介绍一个恶棍式的对冲基金分析师如何\n   和他的同行们在错过了10-20美元的上升空间后，将迅速分析$ASTS。\n   错过了10-20美元的上升空间，该股可能会在2022年3月推出的\n   BlueWalker-3\n   *...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"🚀📶$ASTS Douchebag Hedge Fund Bros將如何評估AST SpaceMobile的價值和370萬美元的頭寸更新 📶🚀","the_new_excerpt":"惡棍式的對沖基金分析師=你通往天堂之路!\n\n * 我將簡要介紹一個惡棍式的對沖基金分析師如何\n   和他的同行們在錯過了10-20美元的上升空間後，將迅速分析$ASTS。\n   錯過了10-20美元的上升空間，該股可能會在2022年3月推出的\n   BlueWalker-3\n   *...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-prwox8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prwox8/the_dip_game/","title":"The Dip game !!","date":"September 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ディップゲーム！？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"沾沾自喜的游戏！!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"沾沾自喜的遊戲！!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-prw8cl","excerpt":"So let me preface this, I’m super new to investing have studied markets and\neconomics for years and am a math guy but never got into investing until a few\nmonths ago.
