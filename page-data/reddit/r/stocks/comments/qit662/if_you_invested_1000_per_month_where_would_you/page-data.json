Homeless here. I live in my car and I am looking to stocks to solve my problems. Ready to harass me with unkind things?</p>\n\n<p>Before you do here are some facts:</p>\n\n<p>I make $11 an hour and work 40 hours a week.</p>\n\n<p>I make enough to invest over $1000 a month.</p>\n\n<p>I only spend $400 a month out of my $1500 - $2000 monthly pay.</p>\n\n<p>I plan on getting an apartment in 2022 at some point as well as a better job.</p>\n\n<p>I want to invest for the long term. My ideal minimum goal would be 10 percent profit every year and take out 4 percent per year when I retire.</p>\n\n<p>I have looked at many stocks past 5 year history and many of them are skyrocket. The ones that seem to go up up up and never really go down in the long term would be the ones I think I would invest in.</p>\n\n<p>I have at least a year of savings at $400 a month meaning my savings is at least $5000.</p>\n\n<p>Having finally looked into stocks and looking up videos for about 100 hours and still having no real true 100 percent plan I know a few things. First: Stock market seems better than a savings account. Second: If I had invested 5 years ago I would have so much more money. Third: It seems some stocks will almost always profit over the long term. Forth: Inflation means stocks are a decent option instead of a bank.</p>\n\n<p>I did put a very small amount of money into stocks and so far have a 2.5 percent return. I put the money in 3 stocks and it increased. That was 24 hours ago.</p>\n\n<p>I have a decent savings account and I was wondering if I should put it all into stocks. The truth is if I put $5000 into stocks and lost it all I would not lose my life and could make it back but it would hurt my heart and make me want to stay in my car a bit longer.</p>\n\n<p>I currently am trying to better myself and I have come a long way. I won&#39;t get into that so try not to judge me to harshly. Right now I am at a point where I can invest a bit more at a low paying job, but I do intend on getting a better job when I can and then get an apartment so I can have a home and invest more money as well. But I also have no friends and no family. I am all on my own with the grace of God and perhaps your input here...</p>\n\n<p>But currently $1000 is completely able to put into the stock market  every month.</p>\n\n<p>Where do YOU personally put your money and where would YOU personally put your money if you were in my situation?</p>\n\n<p>With inflation is it okay to start investing or is it too late now?</p>\n\n<p>Would it be best to stick with the stocks that seem to have a history of doing well or would they be overvalued due to the inflation lately?</p>\n\n<p>In the long term what stocks do you feel will stand the test of time and keep raising even in times of trouble?</p>\n\n<p>Please provide your thoughts and hope I am not too much of a loser. Thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qit662/if_you_invested_1000_per_month_where_would_you/","title":"If you invested $1000 per month where would you put it and where should I put it?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-30T06:49:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-30 06:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qit662","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qit662/if_you_invested_1000_per_month_where_would_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qit662/if_you_invested_1000_per_month_where_would_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"MarinetteXLila","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MarinetteXLila","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MarinetteXLila","score":720,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"毎月1000ドルを投資するとしたら、どこに置くか、どこに置けばいいのか。","the_new_excerpt":"こんにちは。ホームレスです。車の中で生活しているので、株で解決したいと思っています。\n悩んでいます。心ない言葉で私に嫌がらせをする準備はできていますか？\n\nその前にいくつかの事実をご紹介しましょう。\n\n私は時給11ドルで、週に40時間働いています。\n\n私は時給11ドルで週に40時間働いていて、月に1000ドル以上投資できるだけの収入があります。\n\n私は毎月1500ドルのうち400ドルしか使っていません。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如果你每月投资1000美元，你会把它放在哪里，我应该把它放在哪里？","the_new_excerpt":"你好。我是无家可归者。我住在我的车里，我正在寻找股票来解决我的\n问题。准备好用不友好的东西来骚扰我了吗？\n\n在你这样做之前，这里有一些事实。\n\n我每小时挣11美元，每周工作40小时。\n\n我赚的钱足够我每月投资超过1000美元。\n\n我每月只花了1500美元中的400美元 -...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你每月投資1000美元，你會把它放在哪裏，我應該把它放在哪裏？","the_new_excerpt":"你好。我是無家可歸者。我住在我的車裏，我正在尋找股票來解決我的\n問題。準備好用不友好的東西來騷擾我了嗎？\n\n在你這樣做之前，這裏有一些事實。\n\n我每小時掙11美元，每週工作40小時。\n\n我賺的錢足夠我每月投資超過1000美元。\n\n我每月只花了1500美元中的400美元 -...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qio71m","excerpt":"I have about 10k invested in a tech-centered mutual fund.
