As a way to hopefully reduce my upcoming financial burden, I&#39;ve been learning more about finance and investing and retirement accounts. </p>\n\n<p>I currently have about $2000 in a Roth IRA through Fidelity and want to put that money into some good ETFs. Ideally I&#39;d like to maximize my returns via a mix of high and low risk investments, but based on my understanding, it&#39;s more beneficial for me to go for high risk because I have several decades until retirement. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve selected 14 ETFs that have interested me and now need help deciding which to actually invest in. I understand 14 investments would lower my risk, which is why I want to simplify my portfolio to maybe 5 or more ETFs. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance! </p>\n\n<p>List of ETFs: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/OwwaCvB\">https://imgur.com/a/OwwaCvB</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","title":"Getting started with ETFs - how would you allocate $2000 using the following list?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T06:23:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 06:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"db146bc2-66b1-5618-9be9-e5d1488c9c2a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loml90/getting_started_with_etfs_how_would_you_allocate/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"instaxboi","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/instaxboi","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"instaxboi","score":186,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"我今年24岁，再过几个月就要开始上牙科学校了，这意味着我将...\n我毕业后有约40万的债务（美国私立学校，fml）。作为一种方式来\n希望能减轻我即将到来的经济负担，我一直在学习更多的知识。\n理财和投资以及退休账户。\n\n我目前有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"","the_new_excerpt":"我今年24歲，再過幾個月就要開始上牙科學校了，這意味着我將...\n我畢業後有約40萬的債務（美國私立學校，fml）。作爲一種方式來\n希望能減輕我即將到來的經濟負擔，我一直在學習更多的知識。\n理財和投資以及退休賬戶。\n\n我目前有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-89ae3a62-77bb-5088-9167-8c4bfae30dc9","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loj7dz/i_got_inspired_by_all_these_charity_posts_thanks/","title":"I got inspired by all these charity posts.
