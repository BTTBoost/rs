In addition, there has been interesting news regarding the space launch industry as a whole, specifically with respect to satellite constellation launches for providing greater accessibility to affordable high bandwidth internet, all over the world (yay), and real-time global surveillance via satellites with 50cm camera precision (kinda &amp; oh no).</p>\n\n<p>News\n1. Amazon Project Kuiper 🔥 - Amazon had announced its own internet satellite constellation project to launch 3k satellites by 2026-2029. Initial 6 or 9 flights assigned to ULA. RKLB’s constellation supporting rocket, Neutron, is set to be ready to launch in 2024, ready in time to <em>maybe</em> capture some business from Amazon IN ADDITION to all of the ISPs that are going to be banging launch providers doors down, to not get left out of the next great revolution in global internet coverage. \n2. RKLB’s space systems business 👀 - RKLB just announced it had signed a deal to supply reaction wheels “for a number of undisclosed satellite constellations.” AFAIK satellites need 3 reaction wheels to control their orientation on all 3 axes (keeping a 4th as backup). Their production facility at initial capacity will output 2000 a year. 2000 / 4 == 500 satellites a year they are expecting to provision. For reference they’ve only launched 100 satellites themselves so far.\n3. Astra (ASTR) 😪 - had 2 failed launches last weekend in a row, still haven’t made it to orbit, still valued at about 1/2 that of rocket lab (what is wrong with this market). Launch reliability should carry a premium, rocket lab has a proven track record of launch reliability.\n4. Firefly (private) 😪 - watching their livestream of launch right now, and it’s not going too well (called an abort). But we’ll see how it goes…</p>\n\n<p>Some Key Upcoming Events\n1. September 8, Earnings 🍿 - likely will hear status updates regarding larger neutron rocket, as well as their space systems business (please tell us about the contracts regarding reaction wheels mentioned above).\n2. Lunar Mission 2021 (probably Q4) 🌝 - do I even have to say anything? What other space startup is set to fly to the moon this year, for NASA? What doors will this open for them 🚪?\n3. September-October, Back to back to back launches for global surveillance company Black Sky 👀 - this is very interesting as rocket lab has never turned around rockets this fast before. Demonstrating extremely rapid launch cadence will be proving to customer that they can schedule launch on demand essentially. In months, eventually weeks but not years. I expect to also see rocket lab demonstrate reusability of their electron rockets, by catching some with a helicopter (not joking) 🚁.</p>\n\n<p>Summary:\n1. Rocket lab is in a much better position than other space startups that are either still in theoretical phase (never launched), and those that are trying to launch but just can’t seem to get their rockets flying in the proper direction (Astra).\n2. Entrance of tech giants and ISP heavy weights into satellite constellation business is evidence that we are on the brink of a satellite launching party (from all ISPs to avoid getting amazoned, and want to keep their consistently high cash flow business models: Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc.). From all the launches, the planet might heat up a few degrees 😓.\n3. Their neutron rocket is being developed at the right time to compete with SpaceX for launch contracts for such constellations (I also really doubt any one launch provider has the bandwidth to take all the contracts).\n4. Their space systems business (reaction wheels for one), will be a nice revenue stream, even for the satellites that they don’t launch themselves, yet still develop and produce key parts of.</p>\n\n<p>Positions/Disclosure: I have a lot of shares</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Firefly’s launch just blew up 💥</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Rocket Lab successfully catching rocket with helicopter <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HOnNYWu6onU\">https://youtu.be/HOnNYWu6onU</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: founder &amp; CEO Peter Beck on what it takes to succeed in this industry go to 4:20 mark, you won’t be disappointed, (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8ZMSG386dQw\">https://youtu.be/8ZMSG386dQw</a>) hint ⚽️</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: founder &amp; CEO Peter Beck eating a hat, clearly to advance rocket lab’s space program (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Rafa_WBFIyE\">https://youtu.be/Rafa_WBFIyE</a>)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pgv4bi/a_lab_of_rockets_supplement_to_prior_dd_on_rklb/","title":"A Lab of Rockets (supplement to prior DD on RKLB) 🚀 🥼","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"September 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-03T08:57:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-03 08:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pgv4bi","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pgv4bi/a_lab_of_rockets_supplement_to_prior_dd_on_rklb/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pgv4bi/a_lab_of_rockets_supplement_to_prior_dd_on_rklb/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"lilshwarma","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lilshwarma","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lilshwarma","score":1468,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"A Lab of Rockets (RKLBの先行するDDの補足) 🚀 🥼","the_new_excerpt":"これは、ロケットラボのデスパック前夜に書いたDDの予定外の補足です。\nこれは予定外の補足です。\n\n私が最初に見落としていた重要なポイントや触媒を列挙した何十ものコメントがありました。\nロケットラボに関する法的なDDを最初に投稿することに熱心だったので、最初は見逃していました。\n私はRocket Labに関する合法的なDDを最初に投稿することに熱心だったからです（SPACは許可されていないので、数ヶ月前に最初に投稿したときは...）。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"A Lab of Rockets (Supplement to prior DD on RKLB) 🚀 🥼","the_new_excerpt":"这是对我之前在火箭实验室的DD前夕的一个意外补充。\n的前夕，对我之前的DD进行了意外的补充。\n\n我有几十条评论，列出了我最初遗漏的关键点/催化因素。\n因为我很想成为第一个发布关于火箭实验室的法律DD的人。\n实验室（SPACs是不允许的，所以当我几个月前第一次发布时，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"A Lab of Rockets (Supplement to prior DD on RKLB) 🚀 🥼","the_new_excerpt":"這是對我之前在火箭實驗室的DD前夕的一個意外補充。\n的前夕，對我之前的DD進行了意外的補充。\n\n我有幾十條評論，列出了我最初遺漏的關鍵點/催化因素。\n因爲我很想成爲第一個發佈關於火箭實驗室的法律DD的人。\n實驗室（SPACs是不允許的，所以當我幾個月前第一次發佈時，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pgqdsm","excerpt":"> Today, high-quality bonds, a mainstay of most portfolios for their consistent\n> yields and downside protection, offer neither yield nor an inflation hedge.\n> \n> Adjusted for inflation, yields on high-quality bonds are negative.\n> \n> In other words, investing in Treasurys is guaranteed to earn a…","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/pgqdsm/this_article_makes_some_pretty_good_points_about/","title":"This article makes some pretty good points about bonds","date":"September 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"この記事では、ボンドについてかなり良い点を指摘しています。","the_new_excerpt":"> 今日、高品質の債券は、安定した利回りとダウンサイド・プロテクションのために、ほとんどのポートフォリオの柱となっています。\n> 現在、高品質な債券は、安定した利回りとダウンサイド・プロテクションを備えているため、多くのポートフォリオの柱となっていますが、利回りもインフレ・ヘッジもありません。\n> \n> インフレ調整後の高品質債券の利回りはマイナスです。\n> \n> つまり、国債に投資すれば、利回りが保証され...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"这篇文章对债券提出了一些相当好的观点","the_new_excerpt":"> 今天，高质量的债券因其稳定的收益率和下行保护而成为大多数投资组合的支柱。\n> 收益率和下跌保护，既不提供收益率也不提供通货膨胀对冲。\n> \n> 经通货膨胀调整后，优质债券的收益率是负的。\n> \n> 换句话说，投资于国债可以保证获得...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這篇文章對債券提出了一些相當好的觀點","the_new_excerpt":"> 今天，高質量的債券因其穩定的收益率和下行保護而成爲大多數投資組合的支柱。\n> 收益率和下跌保護，既不提供收益率也不提供通貨膨脹對沖。\n> \n> 經通貨膨脹調整後，優質債券的收益率是負的。\n> \n> 換句話說，投資於國債可以保證獲得...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pghzgs","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pghzgs/how_to_lose_50k_chwy/","title":"How to lose $50k $CHWY","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 03, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"5万ドルを失う方法 $CHWY","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"如何损失5万美元CHWY","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何損失5萬美元CHWY","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pgv4bi","previousId":"RedditPost-pgqdsm","nextId":"RedditPost-pghzgs","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pgv4bi/a_lab_of_rockets_supplement_to_prior_dd_on_rklb/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
