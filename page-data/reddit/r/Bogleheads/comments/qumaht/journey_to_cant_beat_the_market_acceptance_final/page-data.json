I mean, I&#39;m smart right? At least smarter than half of you! Then I read Bogle and all the other data showing its single digit % of investors beat the market long term. To understand this I&#39;ve come to a theory that &quot;The Market&quot; is an optimization, not an average. </p>\n\n<p>The theory: as long as society maintains stability (bigger &quot;if&quot; these days), the economy will grow (for reasons) and thus companies and stocks along with it. There is always churn and noise but over the long term the duds get filtered out and the studs end up making a majority of the market. Even if you&#39;re picking good stocks, so is the broader market. That makes it hard to beat when the market also has your winners every time. It also has mostly winners and very few losers so if you happen to pick one bad stock you can easily get crushed vs the index. The market is continually optimizing so the effort and reward for trying to beat it are not justified. </p>\n\n<p>This concludes my surface level, non-economist, inexperienced justification for why I consolidated everything into SNDL...j/k, it starts with a V. Please destroy my optimization theory so I can learn about a hammer candle.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qumaht/journey_to_cant_beat_the_market_acceptance_final/","title":"Journey to \"cant beat the market\" acceptance - final step","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-15T23:17:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-15 23:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qumaht","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qumaht/journey_to_cant_beat_the_market_acceptance_final/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/qumaht/journey_to_cant_beat_the_market_acceptance_final/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"lifejacketpreserver","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lifejacketpreserver","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lifejacketpreserver","score":16,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"市場には勝てない」と納得するまでの道のり-最終ステップ","the_new_excerpt":"私は少し確証バイアスを求めているので、このサブは最適な場所だと思いました。\n始めるのに最適な場所だと思いました...\n\n市場には勝てないとは聞いていましたが、私の最初の仮説である\n私はいつも市場に勝てないと聞いていましたが、50%が他の50%よりもうまくいっているに違いないという最初の仮定と両立できませんでした。つまり、私は\n賢いでしょ？少なくとも皆さんの半分よりはね！...と。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"接受 \"无法战胜市场 \"的旅程--最后一步","the_new_excerpt":"我在寻找一个小的确认偏见，所以这个子似乎是最好的地方\n开始......。\n\n我一直听说你无法战胜市场，但我无法将其与我最初的假设相协调。\n我最初的假设是，50%的人一定比另外50%的人做得更好。我是说，我是\n聪明吧？至少比你们一半的人聪明！...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"接受 \"無法戰勝市場 \"的旅程--最後一步","the_new_excerpt":"我在尋找一個小的確認偏見，所以這個子似乎是最好的地方\n開始......。\n\n我一直聽說你無法戰勝市場，但我無法將其與我最初的假設相協調。\n我最初的假設是，50%的人一定比另外50%的人做得更好。我是說，我是\n聰明吧？至少比你們一半的人聰明！...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1460261845818920970","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1460261845818920970","title":"WeWork has had net losses totaling $13.4 billion since the start of 2016.
