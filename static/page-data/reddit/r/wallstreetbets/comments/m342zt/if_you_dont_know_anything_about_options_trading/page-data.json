No one cares about the 4 shares of whatever stock you own and the price you bought it at. You sound like morons asking what 3/12 means when someone is talking about an options contract.

You can go on investopedia and in 5 minutes learn enough information to not be a complete moron and flood this sub with garbage posts and comments.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t a safe space. This isn’t a school. This is trial by fire and if you say or do something dumb you deserve to get roasted for it. If you want to learn go to a different sub.
