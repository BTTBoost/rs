Gavin Newsom on Tuesday night.\nAB 286 requires delivery apps like DoorDash DASH, 1.93%, Uber Eats UBER, 2.98% and Grubhub GRUB, -0.91% to give delivery workers all their tips. The bill also prohibits food-delivery apps from charging customers more than restaurants do. And it addresses hidden fees by requiring the companies to disclose to restaurants and customers a detailed cost breakdown of each transaction.</p>\n\n<p>“Gig companies have profited during the pandemic by keeping consumers and restaurants in the dark about the true cost of their services,” said state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, who wrote the bill, in a statement. “Now, small restaurants and their customers will know what they’re being charged upfront and get to see exactly how much is actually benefiting the restaurant.”</p>\n\n<p>The bill, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2022, is the latest of many efforts to regulate the burgeoning app-based food-delivery industry. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year, municipalities adopted emergency delivery-fee caps. This year, San Francisco and New York City enacted permanent fee caps, sparking lawsuits from DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub. And New York City last month passed first-in-the-nation legislation that would establish minimum pay for delivery workers, give them access to restaurant bathrooms and more.</p>\n\n<p>DoorDash, which has faced questions about how much its drivers keep in tips and last year settled a lawsuit by Washington, D.C., accusing it of applying tips to workers’ base pay, says on its website that its delivery workers keep all their tips. Uber Eats and Grubhub also say tips go straight to the drivers.</p>\n\n<p>DoorDash said it had no comment on the signing of AB 286. Grubhub and Uber have not returned requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Newsom vetoed another bill, AB 1444, which would have dictated that agreements between restaurants and food delivery platforms be written and include certain content. It also would have restricted delivery platforms from charging restaurants for forwarded calls unless those calls resulted in an order, and required listing websites to disclose whether ordering through them would result in forwarding a call and a fee paid to a third party other than the restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>In his veto message, Newsom said “We have significantly increased oversight of food delivery companies in recent years.” The governor also mentioned that the delivery platforms have said they no longer charge restaurants simply for forwarding calls.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q2n4tm/doordash_uber_eats_grubhub_must_disclose_hidden/","title":"DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub must disclose hidden fees, give delivery workers all tips under new California law","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-06T17:00:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-06 17:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q2n4tm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q2n4tm/doordash_uber_eats_grubhub_must_disclose_hidden/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q2n4tm/doordash_uber_eats_grubhub_must_disclose_hidden/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"TheNewOP","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheNewOP","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"TheNewOP","score":3869,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"DoorDash、Uber Eats、Grubhubは、カリフォルニア州の新しい法律に基づき、隠れた料金を開示し、配達員にすべてのチップを渡す必要があります。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-uber-eats-grubhub-must-disclose-hidden-fees-give-delivery-workers-all-tips-under-new-california-law-11633532289\n\nカリフォルニア州は近々、配達員にチップ保護を与え、DoorDash Inc.\nまた、DoorDash Inc.をはじめとするフードデリバリー・アプリに透明性を求める。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"DoorDash、Uber Eats、Grubhub必须披露隐性费用，并根据加州新法律给予送货员所有小费","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-uber-eats-grubhub-must-disclose-hidden-fees-give-delivery-workers-all-tips-under-new-california-law-11633532289\n\n加利福尼亚州将很快为送餐员提供小费保护，并要求DoorDash公司提高透明度。\n透明度，并要求DoorDash公司和其他食品递送应用程序...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DoorDash、Uber Eats、Grubhub必須披露隱性費用，並根據加州新法律給予送貨員所有小費","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-uber-eats-grubhub-must-disclose-hidden-fees-give-delivery-workers-all-tips-under-new-california-law-11633532289\n\n加利福尼亞州將很快爲送餐員提供小費保護，並要求DoorDash公司提高透明度。\n透明度，並要求DoorDash公司和其他食品遞送應用程序...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1445755313496330251","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1445755313496330251","title":"Sweden pauses use of Moderna COVID vaccine for younger age groups, citing myocarditis ***","date":"October 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"スウェーデン、心筋炎***を理由にModerna COVIDワクチンの若年層への使用を一時停止","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"瑞典以心肌炎为由暂停对年轻群体使用Moderna COVID疫苗 ***","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"瑞典以心肌炎爲由暫停對年輕羣體使用Moderna COVID疫苗 ***","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q2f0nv","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2f0nv/after_sangwoo_discovered_rwsb/","title":"After Sang-Woo discovered r/wsb","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 06, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"サンウがr/wsbを発見してから","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"在Sang-Woo发现r/wsb之后","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在Sang-Woo發現r/wsb之後","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q2n4tm","previousId":"TweetPost-1445755313496330251","nextId":"RedditPost-q2f0nv","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q2n4tm/doordash_uber_eats_grubhub_must_disclose_hidden/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
