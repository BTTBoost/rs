Just a few residual logistical questions to confirm from seasoned users:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Overall context - my family currently holds an emergency fund consisting of 12 months of expenses, in a ‘high yield’ saving account (0.4% right now). My thought is to start building an I bond ladder so that half of the emergency stash is there, with the balance remaining in readily available cash. If anyone thinks this is not a prudent idea for emergency funds I’m happy to understand why or alternatives. </p></li>\n<li><p>After holding an I Bond for the minimum first year, how soon are the funds available (i.e a few business days for the bank transfer)? This is in the context of being emergency funds (and I know I’d lose the three months interest). </p></li>\n<li><p>To confirm the timing of rate transfers, you are guaranteed the current rate for six months from your purchase date, and not up to the next May or November official rate change? For example, if I buy bonds in November, I get the current rate through April. If I buy next April, I’m still guaranteed the current rate through September, because I bought before the May switch?</p></li>\n<li><p>My family consists of my spouse and infant child. If I was only interested in buying 20k in bonds per year (right now at least) - would it be logistically more efficient to set up my account and create a linked minor account for my child, to manage everything in one place? Or, safer to set up separate accounts for myself and spouse? I understand that I would have to delink and transfer my child’s holdings back to me while they were still a minor, but I’ve got 17 years until I’d need to worry about that. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any insight or tips are appreciated, thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/r0uo3u/a_few_questions_about_i_bonds/","title":"A few questions about I Bonds","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-24T06:22:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-24 06:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r0uo3u","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/r0uo3u/a_few_questions_about_i_bonds/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/r0uo3u/a_few_questions_about_i_bonds/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"casper1423","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/casper1423","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"casper1423","score":18,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"I Bondについてのいくつかの質問","the_new_excerpt":"前置きが長くなりましたが、私はこのテーマについてほとんどの宿題を済ませており、このサブ\n(モデレーターの一人による素晴らしい投稿)、treasurydirectのウェブサイトやその他の記事を\nの記事）を参考にしました。ただ、経験豊富なユーザーに確認したいことがいくつかあります。\nユーザーに確認したいことがあります。\n\n 1. 1.全体的な背景 - 私の家族は現在...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"关于I Bonds的几个问题","the_new_excerpt":"作为前言，我已经做了关于这个主题的大部分功课，包括这个子\n(其中一位版主的精彩帖子），the treasurydirect网站和其他\n文章）。只是有一些剩余的后勤问题需要向经验丰富的\n用户确认。\n\n 1. 总体背景--我的家庭目前持有一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於I Bonds的幾個問題","the_new_excerpt":"作爲前言，我已經做了關於這個主題的大部分功課，包括這個子\n(其中一位版主的精彩帖子），the treasurydirect網站和其他\n文章）。只是有一些剩餘的後勤問題需要向經驗豐富的\n用戶確認。\n\n 1. 總體背景--我的家庭目前持有一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1462804632309227528","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1462804632309227528","title":"Apple just added another $100 billion to its market cap, hitting $2.7 trillion for the first time. $AAPL\n\nData via @ycharts https://t.co/2gWwhAGHBI","date":"November 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"アップルは、時価総額にさらに1,000億ドルを追加し、初めて2兆7,000億ドルに到達しました。$AAPL\n\nData via @ycharts https://t.co/2gWwhAGHBI","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"苹果公司的市值刚刚又增加了1000亿美元，首次达到了2.7万亿美元。$AAPL\n\n数据来自@ycharts https://t.co/2gWwhAGHBI","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"蘋果公司的市值剛剛又增加了1000億美元，首次達到了2.7萬億美元。$AAPL\n\n數據來自@ycharts https://t.co/2gWwhAGHBI","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-r0q3mz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0q3mz/buying_pltr_at_24_after_earnings_because_you/","title":"Buying PLTR at 24 after earnings because you thought it was the dip","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 24, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"PLTRを決算後に24で買ったのは、ディップだと思ったから。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"收益后在24点买入PLTR，因为你认为这是一个跌点","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"收益後在24點買入PLTR，因爲你認爲這是一個跌點","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-r0uo3u","previousId":"TweetPost-1462804632309227528","nextId":"RedditPost-r0q3mz","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/r0uo3u/a_few_questions_about_i_bonds/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
