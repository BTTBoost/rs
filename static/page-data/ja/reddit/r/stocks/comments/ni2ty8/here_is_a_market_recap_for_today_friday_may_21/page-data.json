It’s encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterday’s gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.</p>\n\n<p>Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.</p>\n\n<p>As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.</p>\n\n<p>On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about. <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf\">Read the entire meeting minutes here</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), one of the leading semiconductor companies, jumped after the company announced a 4-1 split. This means that after the split goes through, every share of  NVDA will become 4 and the price will adjust accordingly.</li>\n<li>In the midst of surging prices, the housing market has begun showing signs of slowing down. Today, the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales fell 2.7% in April compared to the month prior. That is well below the expectation of 1% growth and may be a sign the rise in prices may be slowing in the near-term. However, compared to April 2020, existing home sales are up 33.9%.</li>\n<li>Snap (SNAP) said it will acquire WaveOptics, a British Augmented Reality company, for over $500 million.
