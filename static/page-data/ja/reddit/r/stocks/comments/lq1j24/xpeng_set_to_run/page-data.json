The company has had no bad news. The stock has a price target of $54. XPENG stock has been hammered down lately due to the lock up period which expires tomorrow. Earnings is on 8 March. $38 seems like an excellent buying opportunity to me. I’ll be adding shares tomorrow near market close. Looks like an easy 10-20% gain in a matter of days/weeks.</p>\n\n<p>LI also looks like a great buy. Quarterly revenue has been seeing consistent growth and earnings is finally reaching break even. Li has also invested a lot of their assets back into the company and their total assets has seen a healthy growth within the last year. </p>\n\n<p>These 2 seemed bound for a pullback after their highs in November but now it seems they are oversold. Are these on anyone else’s watch list ? Anything I should be weary of?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","title":"XPENG set to run?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-23T06:55:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-23 06:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"081f983a-9869-584a-89ef-45ddddc881c3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lq1j24/xpeng_set_to_run/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"theepicone111","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theepicone111","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"theepicone111","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"XPENG设置运行？","the_new_excerpt":"XPENG在11月24日陡然上涨后，最高见74.49美元。自那时起\n现在回落到38美元--跌幅达50%。该公司没有坏消息。该\nXPENG的目标股价为54美元。\n到明天到期的锁定期。盈利是在8...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"XPENG設置運行？","the_new_excerpt":"XPENG在11月24日陡然上漲後，最高見74.49美元。自那時起\n現在回落到38美元--跌幅達50%。該公司沒有壞消息。該\nXPENG的目標股價爲54美元。\n到明天到期的鎖定期。盈利是在8...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1363945332971868163","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1363945332971868163","title":"The S&amp;P 500 is crashing right now thanks to Tesla, which is responsible for 0.12% of its 0.44% decline.","date":"February 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"S&amp;P 500指数现在正在崩溃，这要归功于特斯拉，它要为其0.44%的跌幅负责0.12%。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"S&amp;P 500指數現在正在崩潰，這要歸功於特斯拉，它要爲其0.44%的跌幅負責0.12%。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-2e250879-a412-55c2-ad7b-12ef6218a9d5","excerpt":"TLDR: EV in the next 10 years is going to become the biggest industry in the\nworld, not because of it's green energy but because of automation.
