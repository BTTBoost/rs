I’m talking the Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft , apple , Netflix etc. </p>\n\n<p>Personally I see Apple and Amazon with the highest upside at the moment. Microsoft and google coming close. </p>\n\n<p>For me, Apple having a 2t market cap where half their revenue is from a single product (iPhone) means they have a lot of potential to increase revenue from other streams. For years people have been saying people will stop buying iPhones and apple continuously proves them wrong. I believe they will substantially increase their revenues in 2021/2022 with their new Mac chips. They have a very loyal customer base and it’s very tempting to buy another apple product once you’ve become accustomed to one of them. Product line up is still relatively small so plenty of room to grow there too. IMO we could see 3t market cap easily this year assuming no catastrophic macro economic events. </p>\n\n<p>Amazon and Microsoft arguably have a better business model than apple. Plenty of revenue streams and margins are great. </p>\n\n<p>My top 3 would be Amazon, Microsoft, Apple. What would yours be?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m9vgk3/your_favourite_large_cap_tech_stocks/","title":"Your favourite large cap tech stocks?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-21T15:36:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-21 15:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c1833748-3d3e-59fc-8902-fb3e4d769170","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m9vgk3/your_favourite_large_cap_tech_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m9vgk3/your_favourite_large_cap_tech_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"theepicone111","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theepicone111","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"theepicone111","score":97,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"你最喜欢的大盘科技股？","the_new_excerpt":"很想看看别人关于科技的信念最高的股票。我说的是\n亚马逊，Facebook，微软 ，苹果 ，Netflix等。\n\n我个人认为苹果和亚马逊目前上升空间最大。\n微软和谷歌接近。\n\n对我来说，苹果有2t的市值，其中一半的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你最喜歡的大盤科技股？","the_new_excerpt":"很想看看別人關於科技的信念最高的股票。我說的是\n亞馬遜，Facebook，微軟 ，蘋果 ，Netflix等。\n\n我個人認爲蘋果和亞馬遜目前上升空間最大。\n微軟和谷歌接近。\n\n對我來說，蘋果有2t的市值，其中一半的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-11e12a72-754b-5ada-ac3e-2f30f8dc52d6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9e0ir/never_sell_fcel/","title":"never sell FCEL","date":"March 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不卖FCEL","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不賣FCEL","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-3b4ae5f3-7b4a-5b07-acf1-fa35ae8ec761","excerpt":"Hi everyone,\n\nI'm 27 and I work in the mining industry (Chile) with 14x14 turns, so I want to\nmake some money while I am in my two weeks off.\n\nA month ago, I invested around $12.5k in ETFs (90%) and mutual funds (10%) and\nI'm planning to hold for 15-20 yrs while I add $400 a month from my…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m9wazq/currently_working_in_14x14_turns_and_want_to/","title":"Currently working in 14x14 turns and want to start day trading in my breaks.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 21, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"目前在14x14轮回工作，想在休息时间开始日间交易。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我今年27岁，在矿业（智利）工作，有14x14的转弯，所以我想在这里工作。\n趁着我放假的两个星期，赚点钱。\n\n一个月前，我在ETF（90%）和共同基金（10%）上投资了约1.25万美金，并且\n我打算持有15-20年，同时每月增加400元，从我的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"目前在14x14輪迴工作，想在休息時間開始日間交易。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我今年27歲，在礦業（智利）工作，有14x14的轉彎，所以我想在這裏工作。\n趁着我放假的兩個星期，賺點錢。\n\n一個月前，我在ETF（90%）和共同基金（10%）上投資了約1.25萬美金，並且\n我打算持有15-20年，同時每月增加400元，從我的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-c1833748-3d3e-59fc-8902-fb3e4d769170","previousId":"RedditPost-11e12a72-754b-5ada-ac3e-2f30f8dc52d6","nextId":"RedditPost-3b4ae5f3-7b4a-5b07-acf1-fa35ae8ec761","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m9vgk3/your_favourite_large_cap_tech_stocks/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
