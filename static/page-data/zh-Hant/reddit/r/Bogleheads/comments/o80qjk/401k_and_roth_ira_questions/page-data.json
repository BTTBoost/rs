I am in my mid 20s, so I feel comfortable investing somewhat aggressively. I&#39;m considering investing in 100% equities. </p>\n\n<p>I currently am fully contributing to a 2060 target date fund my 401k offers but am considering switching. All of the funds in my 401k are not mutual funds so I can&#39;t do any research other than the documents my plan provides. After reading my target fund fact sheet it is a mixture of passive and actively traded funds. The expense ratio is 0.26%. The fund has a split of 60/30/10 U.S., international, and bonds currently. </p>\n\n<p>I was originally thinking of keeping this but am potentially interested in switching it up. I have the option of a large cap S&amp;P 500 index fund with an expense ratio of 0.013%, Russell Small Cap Completeness Index with  0.032% expense ratio, international MSCI ACWI index fund with 0.07% expense ratio, and fixed income index tracking the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index with 0.027% expense ratio. I was wondering what everyone&#39;s recommended portfolio constructions would be with these choices.</p>\n\n<p>I also have the option to use BrokerageLink. I was originally considering FZROX+FZILX or FSKAX+FTIHX for my Roth IRA fund I plan to open. I believe I could do that with BrokerageLink for my 401k as well. Do you guys believe this could be a better choice than the default passive index funds my plan offers?</p>\n\n<p>I like the idea of a hands off approach but since my target fund is private I can&#39;t invest in that in my Roth IRA. Thus, I was thinking of either FZROX+FZILX or FSKAX+FTIHX for my Roth IRA. I think anywhere from a 70/30 to 60/40 domestic/international split could be good. I saw a lot of opinions of people on here that they would not mix target fund in 401k with index mutual funds in Roth IRA. That is why I am considering switching up my 401k approach from the target date fund. </p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/o80qjk/401k_and_roth_ira_questions/","title":"401k and Roth IRA Questions","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"June 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-26T15:43:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-26 15:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1ead6c67-6aae-5be7-ad42-bdd72c2e1d28","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/o80qjk/401k_and_roth_ira_questions/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/o80qjk/401k_and_roth_ira_questions/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"KittenMittons31","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/KittenMittons31","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"KittenMittons31","score":15,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"401kとRoth IRAに関する質問","the_new_excerpt":"皆さんこんにちは、お元気ですか？\n\n私はごく最近、新しい仕事を始め、退職後の戦略を考えています。\n戦略を考えています。私は20代半ばなので、多少積極的に投資しても大丈夫だと思っています。\n積極的に投資したいと思っています。100％株式に投資することを考えています。\n\n現在、私は2060年の目標に向けて十分な貢献をしています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"401k和Roth IRA问题","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，希望你们都过得很好。\n\n我最近开始了一份新的工作，并试图弄清楚我的退休战略。\n战略。我现在是20多岁，所以我觉得可以在一定程度上进行投资。\n积极的投资。我正在考虑投资于100%的股票。\n\n我目前正在为2060年的目标全额供款。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"401k和Roth IRA問題","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，希望你們都過得很好。\n\n我最近開始了一份新的工作，並試圖弄清楚我的退休戰略。\n戰略。我現在是20多歲，所以我覺得可以在一定程度上進行投資。\n積極的投資。我正在考慮投資於100%的股票。\n\n我目前正在爲2060年的目標全額供款。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-77fb34f1-34b5-5ac0-b9b3-b15c145294b4","excerpt":"Now I’m not going to pretend that I’m an expert with gold miners (honesty I\ndon’t think anyone can accurately value this industry, just read Barrick’s\n[https://s25.q4cdn.com/322814910/files/doc_presentations/2021/05/Barrick-Q1-2021-Results-Presentation.pdf]\nlatest investor presentation which goes…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o8bq6b/barrick_gold_gold_lagging_competitors_ytd_short/","title":"Barrick Gold ($GOLD) lagging competitors YTD.
