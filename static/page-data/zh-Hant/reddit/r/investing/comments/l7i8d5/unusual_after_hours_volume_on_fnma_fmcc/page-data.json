This seems highly unusual considering the full day’s volume (before the after hours trade) for $FNMA was only 18M.  </p>\n\n<p>With a pending decision from SCOTUS in Collins, this seems correlated, but I’m speculating.  There is other recent news here as well though... the government <a href=\"http://www.glenbradford.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20-1912-0054.pdf\">filed a motion to dismiss</a> all derivative shareholder suits in the Fairholme suit.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/MBSug5ftggY\">Bill Ackman has also chimed in</a> with his opinion on these being undervalued.  With housing booming, profits soaring, and just underlying basic need for the GSEs, I’m curious what will happen if/when SCOTUS issues a favorable ruling within the next 100 days.  </p>\n\n<p>Are these forever foresaken or is there upside here?
