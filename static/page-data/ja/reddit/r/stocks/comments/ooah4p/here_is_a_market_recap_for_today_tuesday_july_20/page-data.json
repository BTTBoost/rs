Despite fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant and potential inflationary pressures, the volume of buys going into the major indexes yesterday suggest market participants remain unperturbed and eager to buy up any significant dips in the market. If anything, today teaches us not to succumb too quickly to fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Today reinforces the remarkable strength of the markets in the US. Potential risks will always be present in the market, and one always has to be prepared to act in case of a downturn, but one shouldn’t make decisions based on fear. We have seen dips like this in the past before the year, yet the three main indexes continue their monster uptrend. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke it’s downtrend and outperformed, climbing roughly 3% today. In other news, Q2 earnings season continues and is shaping up to be another record breaking quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, it seems fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant came to a head, with LA county reinstating its mask mandate and the Japanese government reportedly discussing potentially cancelling the Olympics after a slew of infections among athletes and staff. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.</p>\n\n<p>In Japan, things are going from bad to worse with the Olympics. Despite reinstating a state of emergency and banning spectators from attending the events, the games have so far been beset by a slew of infections by both staffers and athletes. Today, the head Tokyo Olympics Committee did not rule out the potential for the games to still be cancelled last minute.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said yesterday, it’s unclear how the situation will play out, but I continue to urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. </p>\n\n<p>Q2 earnings season is shaping up to another record-setting quarter, similar to Q1 of this year. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS&#39;s Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be &quot;need to be revised higher.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continued its steady decline, 1.20% at the time of writing</li>\n<li>Robinhood (HOOD), popular broker and one of the most awaited IPOs, is set to go public on July 29 with a roughly $35 billion valuation. Personally, I wouldn’t touch this with a 10-foot pole, too much baggage for my liking.
