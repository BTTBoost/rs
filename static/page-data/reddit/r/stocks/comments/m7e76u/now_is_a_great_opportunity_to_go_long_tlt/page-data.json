I am, however, a businessman. As a businessman, I have experience doing business things. It might therefore be pertinent for you all to consider my thesis, for academic purposes at the least.</p>\n\n<p>The last month or two have been, hm, shall I say humorous. Gracefully, I held my tongue as the entire market flipped out about rising treasury yields. Why was I calm amid sharp equity selloffs, rocketing yields, and talk of damaging inflation?</p>\n\n<p>Because a) we&#39;ve heard this story too many times before, b) not mutually exclusive from a), Jerome kept on trying and trying to tell everyone that rates wouldn&#39;t rise for the foreseeable future, and c) this inflation story has not only been bandied about like folklore, but furthermore, all the while, <em>we&#39;ve failed to even reach minimum inflation targets</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we finally heard from our great Teacher, JPow, who reminded the kids that the rules still apply. And what are the rules? Keep printing money and keep rates rock bottom low.</p>\n\n<p>I do not for one moment buy that the unprecedented printing of money, in the face of an unprecedented halt of the entire economy, will cause problematic inflation. Also, in the end, Treasuries are not absolutely tied to the Fed&#39;s overnight rate; the demand for Treasuries is what decides the price and therefore yield of said Treasuries. We&#39;ve just seen one of the biggest selloffs in Treasuries since 2018 (and the very early days of last Feb./March, until the bond ETFs regained sanity and there was a flight to safety). I don&#39;t see yields rising more, becoming totally detached from the Fed rate.</p>\n\n<p>For thirty years, bonds have raged bull-wise. I don&#39;t see that ending when money is cheap as ever. </p>\n\n<p>If anything, I see markets settling on cyclical, strong balance sheet equities. Even that, however, is a stretch for me. FANGMAN is about as cheap as it&#39;s been in a while. Facebook is ridiculously cheap. Amazon doubled earnings expectations recently and wasn&#39;t even rewarded for it. Semiconductors are brimming with demand. Financials are on fire. Airlines and cruises and live events and etc. etc. are preparing to come back with a vengeance. People are buying Bitcoin as if it were gold circa 1849 for Christ&#39;s sakes. We&#39;re just entering the biotech and clean energy age, even if it&#39;s still fledgling and speculative.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, we&#39;ve just finished off a HUGE Treasuries selloff. It&#39;s not about where we are now, but where we were relative to recently, and with rates still near zero and the economy ready to explode, I simply don&#39;t see a reason to seek shelter; bonds will remain strong as a speculative device, as it is in all bull markets. (Bond prices don&#39;t rise because your grandma bought you a couple 20-year Bills so you could make $500 dollars when you turned 21. They rise because institutional investors are trading them.) We&#39;d have to see a serious extension of the recent selloff to justify the velocity of Treasury yields--which have already slowed significantly since the latest growth/tech correction. <strong>Oh yeah, and the Fed is still buying Treasuries...Lots and lots of the every day all day from sunrise to sunset and maybe still in the night when no one is looking.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>For a while now, institutional investors have been short $TLT (lots of put buying as well). Last August, I held the same thesis, didn&#39;t have the confidence to follow through, and shed a single tear for each day that passed as a phenomenal opportunity passed me by. Rates had nowhere to go but back up. Especially mortgage rates had gotten out of control. But this is exactly the overextension I was looking for. This is, potentially, an equally profitable opportunity on the upside.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this trade is, you can also use this as a mechanism to hold cash for future buying opportunities, keeping it low risk. For example, say you park 10% or so in $TLT. Say it continues dropping for a bit longer. You can sell calls, collect the dividend, and keep your basis down until it turns around again. And if it stays flat, fine, either take the premiums or collect the small interest.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re speculating, I think calls are a decent play but not quite yet. Premiums are high as a result of the recent selloff. Personally I think shares are the way to go until IV drops as things stabilize.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to start building a position slowly as it continues dropping--about 1-2% as a nice foundation, then about .2-.5% every week or two after that. Then, when it begins to flatten out and reverse, start buying more aggressively and discontinue my short call program, until I reach about 10% of my portfolio. I&#39;ll then keep it at 10% moving forward, rebalancing when opportunities arise or more cash comes in from the &#39;ole 9-5. (Perhaps here I should note for the record that I am a contractor and freelance in a number of areas, ranging from business development consulting to freelance writing.</p>\n\n<p>That is all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7e76u/now_is_a_great_opportunity_to_go_long_tlt/","title":"Now is a great opportunity to go long $TLT","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-18T06:27:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-18 06:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"afeb45a4-d940-5b3c-bbbe-e2e7bc0a8ca4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7e76u/now_is_a_great_opportunity_to_go_long_tlt/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7e76u/now_is_a_great_opportunity_to_go_long_tlt/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"shabbatshalom44","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/shabbatshalom44","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"shabbatshalom44","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"现在是做多$TLT的好机会。","the_new_excerpt":"正如标题所示，我相信现在是一个很好的时间开始建立一个\n仓位在二十年期国债ETF，股票代码$TLT。\n\n这不是一个革命性的想法--可能是因为我不是财务顾问。\n和我对资本市场的想法，不应该被误解为投资。\n建议。我是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在是做多$TLT的好機會。","the_new_excerpt":"正如標題所示，我相信現在是一個很好的時間開始建立一個\n倉位在二十年期國債ETF，股票代碼$TLT。\n\n這不是一個革命性的想法--可能是因爲我不是財務顧問。\n和我對資本市場的想法，不應該被誤解爲投資。\n建議。我是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0027a7a5-d262-5f82-92dd-8ed55abcaa44","excerpt":"The familiar \"Rate My Portfolio\" sticky can be found here.\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome traders who just can't help…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6wefb/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_wednesday_mar/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Thread on Meme Stocks Wednesday - Mar 17, 2021","date":"March 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks每日主题：Meme Stocks周三--2021年3月17日。","the_new_excerpt":"熟悉的 \"评价我的投资组合 \"贴纸可以在这里找到。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n欢迎那些只是忍不住的贸易商...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks每日主題：Meme Stocks週三--2021年3月17日。","the_new_excerpt":"熟悉的 \"評價我的投資組合 \"貼紙可以在這裏找到。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Arate+my+portfolio&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n歡迎那些只是忍不住的貿易商...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-3675b50f-89d4-5438-a89d-e3c2682223ca","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79jpd/bill_gross_says_hes_betting_against_gamestop_guys/","title":"🦍“Bill Gross says he's betting against GameStop” GUYS, LETS BREAK $210 TOMORROW AND END THIS MOTHERFUCKER!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🚀🚀ONCE AND FOR ALL","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 18, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"🦍\"比尔-格罗斯说他在赌GameStop \"伙计们，让我们明天突破210美元，结束这个该死的家伙！！🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🚀🚀ONCE and for ALL","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"🦍\"比爾-格羅斯說他在賭GameStop \"夥計們，讓我們明天突破210美元，結束這個該死的傢伙！！🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🚀🚀ONCE and for ALL","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-afeb45a4-d940-5b3c-bbbe-e2e7bc0a8ca4","previousId":"RedditPost-0027a7a5-d262-5f82-92dd-8ed55abcaa44","nextId":"RedditPost-3675b50f-89d4-5438-a89d-e3c2682223ca","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m7e76u/now_is_a_great_opportunity_to_go_long_tlt/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
