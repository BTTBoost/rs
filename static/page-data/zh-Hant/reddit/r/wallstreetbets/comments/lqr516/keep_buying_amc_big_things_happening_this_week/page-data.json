I just wanted to inform people of future catalyst that we are about to hit.</p>\n\n<p>AMC is hyped and I don&#39;t see it stopping anytime soon. I suggest you to buy as much as you can within a value that you are comfortable sitting on for the next month. I think there is a potential for huge returns. We have multiple events that could work as catalysts for some significant future gains.</p>\n\n<p>Here they are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>FINRA reports (2/25 release): this will help us confirm if there is still an opportunity for a short squeeze</li>\n<li>Q4 Earnings (3/5 release): this could cause a huge spike in buys since I expect to see an uptrend in revenue due to states opening back up. Also keep in mind the last bump allowed AMC to pay off a bunch of their built up debt caused by COVID-19 closing</li>\n<li>COVID-19 vaccines: large number of people are getting the vaccine which will cause a surge in hope for the light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday we saw what happened when NYC announced re-opening of all of their theaters to 25%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I repeat this is not financial advice and I don&#39;t want you to buy due to FOMO but I think this bet has a good short term and long term play. Short term is we get a nice short squeeze. Long term is the stock settles to over $20 like its competitors. The worlds largest theater chain should not be trading for 1/4 of its competition.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to play it relatively safe then please only invest money that will not needed for at least a year. This way you can play the short and long game.</p>\n\n<p>Love you all! I hope this is prosperous for you all and any money troubles you have can be washed away! Go get them apes!</p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/amc\">https://fintel.io/so/us/amc</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc?mod=quote_search\">https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc?mod=quote_search</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amctheatres.com/on-demand\">https://www.amctheatres.com/on-demand</a></p>\n\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 1:  I forgot to mention that AMC just released their own streaming service that will allow you to watch blockbuster movies from you home.
