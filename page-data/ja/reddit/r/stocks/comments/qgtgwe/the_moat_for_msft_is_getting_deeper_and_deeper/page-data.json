While both have very similar services, Azure has much much bigger edge than AWS. That edge is getting bigger and sharper every single day. In a recent interview, Satya Nadella, who transformed Microsoft from a company that was going no where to now a 2+ T company in his 5-6 years mentioned a key point:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft was entering into markets where it did not have permissions from its customers, and entering it out of envy. </li>\n<li>Microsoft will contain to expand into adjacent markets. For ex: Linkedin is used by Professionals for networking, so it is an adjacent market. They will do so through in house products such as Teams (which is eating up all the market that slack and zoom were supposed to capture), or through acquisitions such as Github or linkedin.</li>\n<li>Security is a major focus for Microsoft (Hello CrowdStrike)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Link here : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Osca2Zax4Y&amp;t=1443s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Osca2Zax4Y&amp;t=1443s</a></p>\n\n<p>There are many key points and it is hour worth spending. The guy is extremely humble, honest and an absolute people person. Many of my friends had moved from Microsoft to AWS in 2013/2014 because of all the bureaucracy , moved back to Microsoft around 2018 and are happy and thriving there. </p>\n\n<p>The one thing I want to mention just out of observation is, the features Microsoft is adding in Azure, it is actually borrowing from leading Products in different spaces. </p>\n\n<p>For example: Take CrowdStrike or SentinelOne. Their latest and best if Endpoint protection. These companies ONLY do security. But say a company is using azure and can&#39;t afford to hire dedicated security engineers, they will go with Microsofts &quot;out of the box&quot; solution: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/security/business/threat-protection/endpoint-defender\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/security/business/threat-protection/endpoint-defender</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Both AWS and Azure are a bit like <a href=\"https://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a>. They have all these different products renting space one way or another, and both of them can see (to a certain extent) which products are expanding quickly. Enter that market and just capture it. Though AWS started wayyy before Azure, it is losing to Azure. The picture 3 years from now in terms of % of market between them will be very different. My bet is Azure would very close to AWS and potentially take lead sometime soon thereafter. </p>\n\n<p>One last thing, while facebook is getting into meta verse. Microsoft already has Hololens and companies actually using it. So, from CRM to office to Xboxto azure to hololens to security and new areas like AR/VR, BioTech without the baggage for AWS ( Amazon competing with retail giants and regulatory issues etc). Microsoft has near zero baggage. Hedge funds thing of it as a safe heaven when nothing else is working, same with institutions, and guess what same with CIOs.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qgtgwe/the_moat_for_msft_is_getting_deeper_and_deeper/","title":"The Moat for MSFT is getting deeper and deeper","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-27T18:31:18.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-27 18:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qgtgwe","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qgtgwe/the_moat_for_msft_is_getting_deeper_and_deeper/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qgtgwe/the_moat_for_msft_is_getting_deeper_and_deeper/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"stockist420","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/stockist420","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"stockist420","score":79,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"MSFTのMoatはどんどん深くなっている","the_new_excerpt":"私はクラウドアーキテクチャーの仕事をしており、AWSとAzureの両方（一部GCPも）で仕事をしています。\nどちらも似たようなサービスを提供していますが、AzureはAWSよりもはるかに大きな強みを持っています。\nそのエッジは日々大きく、鋭くなっています。最近のインタビューでは\nサティア・ナデラ氏は最近のインタビューの中で、マイクロソフトを...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"MSFT的护城河正变得越来越深","the_new_excerpt":"我从事云计算架构工作，在AWS和Azure（以及一些GCP）上工作。\n虽然两者都有非常相似的服务，但Azure的优势比AWS大得多。\n这种优势每天都在变大，变尖锐。在最近的一次采访中。\n萨提亚-纳德拉（Satya Nadella），他将微软从一个公司转变为一个...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"MSFT的護城河正變得越來越深","the_new_excerpt":"我從事雲計算架構工作，在AWS和Azure（以及一些GCP）上工作。\n雖然兩者都有非常相似的服務，但Azure的優勢比AWS大得多。\n這種優勢每天都在變大，變尖銳。在最近的一次採訪中。\n薩提亞-納德拉（Satya Nadella），他將微軟從一個公司轉變爲一個...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qh0pw3","excerpt":"Yes, the title says it all.
