I started becoming nervous a few days later so I liquidated a lot of stocks. However, I bought back a lot of GME yesterday after a dip and finally gave up today seeing that the bubble had already burst and it wasn&#39;t a dip.</p>\n\n<p>Can I live without $1500. Yes (In fact I even forgot to cash in a $1500 check for over a year). I&#39;m only 23 and in grad school, so I like to look at each dollar very carefully. I&#39;m also anguished at all the things $1500 could&#39;ve bought me (a 75&#39;&#39; flat screen TV, a plane ticket to anywhere in the world, etc. But 1500 is only about 3% of my assets so I&#39;m trying to sweat this off and move on as quick as possible. But I learned not to jump on stocks based on emotion. At one point, I was even up $1000 but I got too greedy and look where I&#39;m now.</p>\n\n<p>On the bright side, my overall portfolio is only down $600 since New Years Day and I&#39;m still up 20% since last february (compared to the S&amp;P gain on 18%)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lb82we/lost_1500_investing_in_meme_stocks_in_a_6_days/","title":"Lost $1500 investing in meme stocks in a 6 days","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T00:39:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 00:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"cd2b6f0a-2479-5f91-b5f8-1447f1af42ae","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb82we/lost_1500_investing_in_meme_stocks_in_a_6_days/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lb82we/lost_1500_investing_in_meme_stocks_in_a_6_days/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Ukrainepolandborder","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ukrainepolandborder","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Ukrainepolandborder","score":328,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投资追忆股6天亏损1500元。","the_new_excerpt":"我感到很欣慰，我今天下午卖掉了我所有的股票，即使是在一个大的\n损失。\n\n上周，我投资了大约6千块钱到各种追忆股。我开始变得\n几天后紧张，所以我清仓了很多股票。不过，我买回了\n昨天跌了很多GME，最后放弃了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資追憶股6天虧損1500元。","the_new_excerpt":"我感到很欣慰，我今天下午賣掉了我所有的股票，即使是在一個大的\n損失。\n\n上週，我投資了大約6千塊錢到各種追憶股。我開始變得\n幾天後緊張，所以我清倉了很多股票。不過，我買回了\n昨天跌了很多GME，最後放棄了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-19b5bae8-2094-574a-9714-712e1ccde6b2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lauvug/monday_market_opening_attack_explained_how/","title":"MONDAY MARKET OPENING ATTACK EXPLAINED: How institutional investors brought GME down by $5B in 1 hour with $250M","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"周一市场开盘攻击解读。机构投资者如何用2.5亿美元让GME在1小时内跌去50亿美元？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"週一市場開盤攻擊解讀。機構投資者如何用2.5億美元讓GME在1小時內跌去50億美元？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-93bc1246-0e99-5e28-9ddf-a6240b6c1dfe","excerpt":"I started investing right when I turned 18 in the summer of 2020.
