I quit my job when I got back and was thinking about buying some stocks. Was looking at maybe day trading GME or AMC, those seem to be the most popular. I only need about $1400/month for my expenses and I’m planing on maybe taking out another 20k loan so I can really go all in on this. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s what I got:\n40k winnings + 40k I initially bet with\n20k loan from the bank\n10k cash advance on my moms credit card</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking an even split on GME and AMC might send me to the moon. My expenses aren’t too bad so I can hold over if nothing is gonna hit just yet plus I’ll have to start paying this cash advance back monthly. Maybe I can get some pointers on other stocks y’all think is worth looking into. </p>\n\n<p>Also when do y’all think I should pay off the cash advance? Once I’m bringing in the bags I might just pay it off at once.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: my wife’s boyfriend is actually gonna loan me the 10k so I’ll pay him back interest free. No need to advance on my moms card 🙏</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2: I’m moving to Vegas, just talked it over with the wife. She said her bf is also moving there too so it’s all falling into place. Y’all are the best ✊</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 3: Talked to my priest (who was the one who set up my wife and her boyfriend) and he recommended I look into investing in alt coins. It allows me to night trade, so that&#39;s a huge plus. I also see a lot of influencers coming out with their own coins, maybe I can get there someday. Thanks for the help guys!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pevi5k/hit_40k_in_black_and_thinking_about_investing_it/","title":"Hit 40k in black and thinking about investing it in stocks.
