Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that&#39;s all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It&#39;s good to have a decent amount of players here but let&#39;s keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let&#39;s keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>too many new wannabe autists</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>WSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren&#39;t true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don&#39;t agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don&#39;t even understand the last sentence.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>this isn&#39;t WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Anyone who&#39;s been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it&#39;s mainly memes. It&#39;s fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to fix this?</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in <a href=\"/r/all\">r/all</a> for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.</li>\n<li>Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer&#39;s dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don&#39;t need SEC to do us what your wife&#39;s boyfriend does to your wife.</li>\n<li>GME to the moon</li>\n<li>WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It&#39;s pretty simple and if you can&#39;t accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.</li>\n<li>Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there&#39;s nothing we can do.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>positions:</p>\n\n<p>pronebone, 156 shares of TSLA, 80 shares of GME, lots of leap calls and smaller positions</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2kdlt/future_of_wsb/","title":"Future of WSB","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"January 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-22T16:00:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-22 16:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"8ced5cec-ad36-5684-bfa5-451f301c428c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2kdlt/future_of_wsb/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2kdlt/future_of_wsb/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Engine3er","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Engine3er","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Engine3er","score":9091,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WSB的未来","the_new_excerpt":"我主要潜伏了几年，在我看来，目前有\n关于这个subreddit的几个问题。\n\n\n\n * 太多的宣传\n\nWSB原本是一个自闭症患者的小团体，希望通过大的收获\n聪明的游戏。今天的WSB更像是一个开放的讨论区，就这样... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"WSB的未來","the_new_excerpt":"我主要潛伏了幾年，在我看來，目前有\n關於這個subreddit的幾個問題。\n\n\n\n * 太多的宣傳\n\nWSB原本是一個自閉症患者的小團體，希望通過大的收穫\n聰明的遊戲。今天的WSB更像是一個開放的討論區，就這樣... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bf66c07f-0594-5a69-b7ce-deebef143163","excerpt":"Don't be doxxing citron or anyone else.
