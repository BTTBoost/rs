&lt;p&gt;PLTR  CEO Karp made a goofy video last October claiming PLTR has nothing stopping it from going &amp;quot;20x&amp;quot; in price. Then, a month later he dumps $42 million worth of his shares right after the stock had already fallen by about 25%. Basically making it look like he had no faith in his own company after his wild and outlandish claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning Karp was on CNBC. They asked if he was going to stop diluting the shares. He said point blank that dilution would continue in the form of employee compensation. He simply alleged that the stock price would rise despite dilution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me lose faith in PLTR. That and the fact that Karp looks so ridiculous all the time with his uncombed hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if I should cut down to 3 months in the medium risk portfolio for a total of 6 months worth of emergency fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would invest the difference in a more aggressive portfolio for retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or should I just stick with the 9 month emergency fund like I have it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Am leaning towards cashing out the AWP and buying 3-months expenses of i-bonds and keep 3 months cash for spending and small emergencies. I will invest the difference in my 3 fund portfolio. Is this better and adequate?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathie Wood — known for her innovation ETFs that garnered billions in inflows during the pandemic — said Ark Invest is internally testing a fund that takes the strategy a step further by simultaneously betting against major stocks in the benchmarks that are being disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think the benchmarks are where the big risks are long-term because they are filling up with value-traps, those companies that have done very well historically but are going to be disintermediated and disrupted by the massive amount of innovation that’s taking place,” Wood added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like Cathie Wood had found another way to attract investors money. People buying on these ark funds need to understand that the stocks inside are very random. Investors might easily lose money since many of them do not even realize what are they buying and investing.&lt;/p&gt;

The customer service team for my UI (Stake) was very responsive &amp;amp; helpful &amp;amp; basically explained that although publicly the low for the day was above my stop loss set point, it was triggered by a(likely) dark pool transaction and sent me some supporting pics of Bloomberg terminal showing the price action. I am hoping someone can help me understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an ETF that is shown moving by a few cents at a time, what kind of price action could explain a drop of 21c and then back up 20c in less than a second?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a transaction large enough to move the ETF price that much occurs, how would it not become visible on public charting like Yahoo finance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone ever encountered something like this?&lt;/li&gt;

Just a few residual logistical questions to confirm from seasoned users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall context - my family currently holds an emergency fund consisting of 12 months of expenses, in a ‘high yield’ saving account (0.4% right now). My thought is to start building an I bond ladder so that half of the emergency stash is there, with the balance remaining in readily available cash. If anyone thinks this is not a prudent idea for emergency funds I’m happy to understand why or alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After holding an I Bond for the minimum first year, how soon are the funds available (i.e a few business days for the bank transfer)? This is in the context of being emergency funds (and I know I’d lose the three months interest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm the timing of rate transfers, you are guaranteed the current rate for six months from your purchase date, and not up to the next May or November official rate change? For example, if I buy bonds in November, I get the current rate through April. If I buy next April, I’m still guaranteed the current rate through September, because I bought before the May switch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family consists of my spouse and infant child. If I was only interested in buying 20k in bonds per year (right now at least) - would it be logistically more efficient to set up my account and create a linked minor account for my child, to manage everything in one place? Or, safer to set up separate accounts for myself and spouse? I understand that I would have to delink and transfer my child’s holdings back to me while they were still a minor, but I’ve got 17 years until I’d need to worry about that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insight or tips are appreciated, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

The general consensus is that this likely will not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,  one thing that *IS* likely to happen - is that the stock price will drop after the dividend date (thus making the above strategy useless). I&amp;#39;m assuming then, and correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong, that the stock price will eventually recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this &amp;quot;recovery&amp;quot; then due to natural stock *growth* or is the recovery some sort of market mechanism specific to dividend stocks where naturally money flows back into the stock after the post-dividend drop? (I&amp;#39;m aware this could be a distinction without a difference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If recovery for many stocks is inevitable then I&amp;#39;m surprised I haven&amp;#39;t seen much discussion about investment strategies where you purchase the stock after the post-dividend drop? What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANSWERED: The assumption that the stock price will drop after the dividend date or that the stock price will recover is incorrect. Thanks to those who answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Glad to see reddit is as toxic as ever for asking a question - please get some sunshine. I find it astonishing because if you asked a question like this in real life you&amp;#39;d just get a normal answer from a normal person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Lucid +100% in three weeks. SP $52. Now $86B MC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like you, SoFi didn’t fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the $LCID  $15 dip. And sadly, I wasn’t able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years  ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV “pure plays” in the market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polestar — Volvo’s EV spinoff brand — estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polestar is the only global EV ‘pure play,’ other than Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little background…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Polestar” takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris — not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That’s &lt;em&gt;Polstjärnan&lt;/em&gt; (literal translation, “Pole Star”) if you’re Swedish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo’s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp;amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being “independent since 2017.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying Tesla’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying Lucid’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don&amp;#39;t even own the actual companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gores&amp;#39; Deals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gores’ track record speaks for itself…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EV Graveyard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Polestar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How  many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when  they IPO’d? Answer: 1,400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polestar just makes cars, baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Thomas Ingenlath: “We have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claim confirmed. And look at that jawline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/bdws59yi7d181.jpg?width=279&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=acb198c00c9a8a7fd9ddbfa26f07a251d0438ccf&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bdws59yi7d181.jpg?width=279&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=acb198c00c9a8a7fd9ddbfa26f07a251d0438ccf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polestar estimates 65,000 deliveries in FY22 and revenues in excess of $3B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tdq7nril7d181.jpg?width=841&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dfe3b9e83a69063aec615d270af306824db49745&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tdq7nril7d181.jpg?width=841&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dfe3b9e83a69063aec615d270af306824db49745&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Polestar 1 came out in 2019. It’s a hybrid premium sports car that will set you back $155K… 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph. They’re badass, and hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/0dasupiq7d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=434e3a17bb658785780fc7c8b6fff3256126e0bc&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0dasupiq7d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=434e3a17bb658785780fc7c8b6fff3256126e0bc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Polestar 2 launched in 2020. Polestar 2… What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think Subaru Outback meets the Model 3 — with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic. It’s a sedan, but its higher ride- height and rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a   hatchback. Let’s call it a “crossover coupe.” Available now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x8zmzdds7d181.jpg?width=855&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a84378d4ccd083505763069ba3fbd8d058eeead8&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/x8zmzdds7d181.jpg?width=855&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a84378d4ccd083505763069ba3fbd8d058eeead8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Versus the Tesla Model 3**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Polestar 2 compares favorably to the Tesla 3 in both price and range:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSRP:   $47,200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal tax credit:  -$7,500&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total:      $39,700&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range:      265 miles (single-motor base model)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla Model 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSRP:       $43,990&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal tax credit:      Does not currently qualify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total:      $43,990&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Range:      262 miles (base model)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming Polestar lineup…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar 3 (2022) — luxury electric SUV built in the USA at Volvo’s South Carolina factory. Polestar also hopes to have the South Carolina vehicles be union-made… no easy task these days (looking at you, Austin   Elon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ingenlath (CEO): &amp;quot;Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American customers. I remember the great response when I first shared Polestar&amp;#39;s vision here in the USA and I am proud that our first SUV will be manufactured in South Carolina. From now on, the USA is no longer an export market but a home market.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/q4jf1pcu7d181.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49de94c3e732830f13281df5cda411c7bd069917&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q4jf1pcu7d181.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49de94c3e732830f13281df5cda411c7bd069917&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar 4  (2023) — smaller SUV that will exhibit a coupe-like profile and is set to compete with the Porsche Macan and the Tesla Model Y.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polestar 5  (2024) — sports sedan inspired by the Precept concept car, competing with the Tesla Model S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political / Regulatory Tailwinds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and global political environment has never been more positive for investment in electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the House of Representatives voted 228-206 to pass the “Build Back Better” infrastructure bill totaling $1.2 trillion. This is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2021/11/06/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-12500-ev-tax-credit-still-awaits-passage/&quot;&gt;https://electrek.co/2021/11/06/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-12500-ev-tax-credit-still-awaits-passage/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand Rollout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series a couple weeks ago, I saw this TV commercial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launched ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human advancement, the way we live now and the damage we&amp;#39;re doing to the   planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nyberg: &amp;quot;Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s our boy Cramer at CNBC have to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x4416g7y7d181.jpg?width=404&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9f2cb070788b53713d719de41c9eac937041c70c&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/x4416g7y7d181.jpg?width=404&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9f2cb070788b53713d719de41c9eac937041c70c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cramer on $GGPI:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“They’re connected with Polestar. OK, here’s the problem: Rivian is coming public. This group has gotten a little too hot. Let’s let things cool off before we get hurt.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok,  Cramer has a point here, but not necessarily about GGPI. Your downside risk on LCID, TSLA, RIVN is technically limitless. GGPI on the other hand, has a NAV (net asset value) floor of approximately $10 until merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Leo have to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ftekhvy08d181.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=323fed8deaa4eac96ef21ac80768900f4afd3bc9&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ftekhvy08d181.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=323fed8deaa4eac96ef21ac80768900f4afd3bc9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we don’t know a lot about Leo’s investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“[CEO] Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake… DiCaprio [has] in  the  company. ‘One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is sustainability,’ Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. ‘It’s as well very important for Leo. He and us being joined on that journey, him   investing in our company, obviously that makes sense for both sides.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do the Island Bois and Hard Rock Nick have to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/vrbht6x28d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=54efe6ff90c615f0ae349f89f312f67589dab256&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vrbht6x28d181.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=54efe6ff90c615f0ae349f89f312f67589dab256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; $GGPI is taking Swedish EV auto maker Polestar public. The cars are sexy AF, and match up well with the Tesla Model 3 on both performance and price. Polestar has 29K cars on the road and $1.5B in  revenue in FY21, and still trades at a deep discount to other EV pure  plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: Long $GGPI, shares + options + warrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who have followed the overall gold price curve will probably have noticed it always reaches a certain top to than fall down again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your outlook on the gold price for the coming months and next year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday new &lt;strong&gt;PCE inflation data&lt;/strong&gt; will be released and we all know it will be hot, but high inflation seems to just scare gold instead of bolstering it, since most seem to derive from it that the Fed will tighten more rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think however Fed will stick to its &amp;quot;inflation is transitory&amp;quot; narrative and won&amp;#39;t speed up its bond tapering, let alone raise interest rates any time soon to avoid spooking the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final point.. for those who want to bring up &lt;strong&gt;bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;, I just want to say that bitcoin and gold are not correlated in any way. Money is not flowing from gold into bitcoin. As example, in past days BTC was also down together with gold. BTC is more related to risk-on mentality like equities than it is with gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you see gold evolve coming months and next year and why? Thanks in advance for all good feedback on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: does anybody know when will be the next time Powell will speak again and will this be before the december 15th FOMC meeting? His comments on the speed of QE tapering could have a big impact on the markets and gold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a world-beating rally, sentiment on Indian shares has soured due to broker downgrades and concerns about tightening liquidity, worsened by a poor showing for the nation’s biggest initial public offering. By contrast, there is growing belief among investors that Chinese stocks could bounce back as the worst is probably over for Beijing’s regulatory scrutiny of private enterprises&lt;/p&gt;
