The vast majority of the union rejected a contract offer earlier this week that would have delivered 5% raises to some workers and 6% raises to others.</p>\n\n<p>“The almost one million UAW retirees and active members who stand in solidarity with the striking UAW members at John Deere,&quot; UAW President Ray Curry said.</p>\n\n<p>Brad Morris, vice president of labor relations for Deere, said in a statement that the company is &quot;committed to a favorable outcome for our employees, our communities and everyone involved.” He said Deere wants an agreement that would improve the economic position of all employees.</p>\n\n<p>“We will keep working day and night to understand our employees’ priorities and resolve this strike, while also keeping our operations running for the benefit of all those we serve,” Morris said.</p>\n\n<p>Thirty-five years have passed since the last major Deere strike, but workers were emboldened to demand more this year after working long hours throughout the pandemic and because companies are facing worker shortages.</p>\n\n<p>“Our members at John Deere strike for the ability to earn a decent living, retire with dignity and establish fair work rules,” said Chuck Browning, vice president and director of the UAW’s Agricultural Implement Department. “We stay committed to bargaining until our members’ goals are achieved.”</p>\n\n<p>Chris Laursen, who works as a painter at Deere, told the Des Moines Register before the strike that it could make a significant difference.</p>\n\n<p>“The whole nation’s going to be watching us,” Laursen said to the newspaper. “If we take a stand here for ourselves, our families, for basic human prosperity, it’s going to make a difference for the whole manufacturing industry. Let’s do it. Let’s not be intimidated.”</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, another group of UAW-represented workers went on strike at a Volvo Trucks plant in Virginia and wound up with better pay and lower-cost health benefits after rejecting three tentative contract offers.</p>\n\n<p>The contracts under negotiation covered 14 Deere plants across the United States, including seven in Iowa, four in Illinois and one each in Kansas, Colorado and Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>The contract talks at the Moline, Illinois-based company were unfolding as Deere is expecting to report record profits between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion this year. The company has been reporting strong sales of its agricultural and construction equipment this year.</p>\n\n<p>The Deere production plants are an important contributors to the economy, so local officials hope any strike will be short-lived.</p>\n\n<p>“We definitely want to see our economy stabilize and grow after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Moline Mayor Sangeetha Rayapati said to the Quad-Cities Times. “Hopefully, these parties can come to a resolution soon.”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q7y25k/deere_co_workers_go_on_strike_after_rejecting/","title":"Deere & Co. workers go on strike after rejecting contract","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-14T13:29:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-14 13:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q7y25k","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q7y25k/deere_co_workers_go_on_strike_after_rejecting/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q7y25k/deere_co_workers_go_on_strike_after_rejecting/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"_hiddenscout","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_hiddenscout","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_hiddenscout","score":2095,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Deere & Co.の労働者が契約を拒否してストライキに突入。","the_new_excerpt":"https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/wireStory/deere-workers-strike-rejecting-contract-80573596\n\n米国イリノイ州モリーン -- 1万人を超えるディア社の労働者が木曜日にストライキを実施。\n会社が組合員の要求を満たす合意を提示できなかった」ため、10,000人のDeere & Co.\n連合自動車労組は、「会社が組合員の要求とニーズを満たす合意を提示できなかった」として、10,000人以上のDeere & Co.","locale":"ja"},{"title":"迪尔公司的工人在拒绝合同后进行罢工","the_new_excerpt":"https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/wireStory/deere-workers-strike-rejecting-contract-80573596\n\n伊利诺伊州莫林市 -- 10,000多名迪尔公司的工人周四举行了罢工。\n因为 \"公司未能提出满足我们成员要求和需要的协议\n联合汽车工人工会说，\"公司未能提出满足我们成员要求和需要的协议\"。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"迪爾公司的工人在拒絕合同後進行罷工","the_new_excerpt":"https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/wireStory/deere-workers-strike-rejecting-contract-80573596\n\n伊利諾伊州莫林市 -- 10,000多名迪爾公司的工人週四舉行了罷工。\n因爲 \"公司未能提出滿足我們成員要求和需要的協議\n聯合汽車工人工會說，\"公司未能提出滿足我們成員要求和需要的協議\"。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q7vtnz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/q7vtnz/reminder_dont_be_this_guy/","title":"Reminder, DON’T BE THIS GUY!","date":"October 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"思い出してください、DON'T BE THIS GUY!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"提醒您，不要做这个人！。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"提醒您，不要做這個人！。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q7yayt","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7yayt/recession_cancelled/","title":"Recession cancelled","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 14, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"リセッション解除","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"衰退取消了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"衰退取消了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q7y25k","previousId":"RedditPost-q7vtnz","nextId":"RedditPost-q7yayt","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q7y25k/deere_co_workers_go_on_strike_after_rejecting/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
