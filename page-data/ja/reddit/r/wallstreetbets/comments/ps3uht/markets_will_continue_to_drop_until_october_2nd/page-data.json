Just look at this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1439635649771065352\">tweet</a> from Katmai National Park yesterday. This is clearly a warning, possibly from agents gone rouge in Alaska letting us know that from September 29th to October 2nd, we will be in &quot;Fat Bear Week&quot;. As we all know, fat bears can only happen when the market is crashing. This is clear evidence that the NPS is currently engaged in market manipulation to make as many rich bears as possible before the end of next week. Furthermore, in other <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1439680697573257222\">tweets</a> they talk about how some bears act as pirates and steal other bear&#39;s fish! This clearly shows that all bears will make enough money to survive winter, but as usual larger &quot;institutional&quot; bears will make even more money!</p>\n\n<p>I think we need to applaud the bravery of these park rangers who are risking their lives exposing this incredible fraud. I had thought the Department of the Interior would be less nefarious than this, but clearly they cannot be trusted. I only hope that the rangers who gave us this important information can safely escape into the Alaskan wilderness and avoid being eaten by bears.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr: Fat bears for 2 weeks</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: As was pointed out in the comments, the NPS likely has motive to destroy all US industry. Companies having less money means they buy less land, which can eventually be turned into more National Parks. This shows clear motive for why this is being done to us.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ps3uht/markets_will_continue_to_drop_until_october_2nd/","title":"Markets Will Continue to Drop Until October 2nd due to National Park Service Interference","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"September 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-21T09:21:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-21 09:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ps3uht","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ps3uht/markets_will_continue_to_drop_until_october_2nd/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ps3uht/markets_will_continue_to_drop_until_october_2nd/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"aquoola","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/aquoola","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"aquoola","score":1327,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"米国国立公園局の妨害により、10月2日まで市場の下落が続く","the_new_excerpt":"NPSはあからさまに市場を操作しており、その理由やいつ止めるのかなど、不可解な手がかりを与えています。\nそして、なぜこのようなことをしているのか、いつ止めるのかという謎の手がかりを与えています。このツイートを見てください。\n[https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1439635649771065352] 昨日のカトマイ国立公園の\n昨日のカトマイ国立公園のツイート[]を見てください。これは明らかに警告であり、もしかしたらエージェントがいなくなったのかもしれない...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"由于国家公园管理局的干扰，市场将在10月2日前继续下跌","the_new_excerpt":"国家统计局正在明目张胆地操纵市场，并给出了隐晦的线索，说明他们为什么要这样做，以及他们何时会停止。\n他们正在这样做，以及他们何时会停止。请看这条推文\n[https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1439635649771065352] 来自卡特迈国家\n公园昨天发布的这条推文。这显然是一个警告，可能是来自于特工人员走了......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"由於國家公園管理局的干擾，市場將在10月2日前繼續下跌","the_new_excerpt":"國家統計局正在明目張膽地操縱市場，並給出了隱晦的線索，說明他們爲什麼要這樣做，以及他們何時會停止。\n他們正在這樣做，以及他們何時會停止。請看這條推文\n[https://twitter.com/KatmaiNPS/status/1439635649771065352] 來自卡特邁國家\n公園昨天發佈的這條推文。這顯然是一個警告，可能是來自於特工人員走了......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ps88oi","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ps88oi/live_footage_of_robinhood_customer_service/","title":"Live footage of Robinhood customer service","date":"September 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロビンフッド顧客サービスのライブ映像","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"罗宾汉客服的现场录像","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"羅賓漢客服的現場錄像","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ps0u1j","excerpt":"If you follow the great value investors, they all seem to allude to a similar\nidea: You don't own a stock, you own part of a business.\n\nStocks go up and down and it makes sense that you want to sell if for more than\nyou paid for it.
