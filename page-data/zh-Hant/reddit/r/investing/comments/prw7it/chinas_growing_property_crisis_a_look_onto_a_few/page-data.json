Unorderly containment + large spill over</strong></p>\n\n<p>Evergrande default spills over to other property and real estate firms in China.. with unorderly containment, leading to a considerable decline in many related industries (incl. services) due to panic and liquidity-squeeze-related market actions. Property prices in China would collapse and lead to a moderately sized property sell-off -&gt; the rather significant negative GDP impact would hit Chinese wallets directly, leading to severe repercussions for China-focused firms (global) and China’s future growth in general</p>\n\n<p>-&gt; large impact on international markets (most sectors), global crisis potential, quicker decline of China’s GDP, FED would have to delay tapering </p>\n\n<p><strong>2.) Orderly containment - moderate spill over</strong></p>\n\n<p>Evergrande default spills over to other property firms in China.. with orderly containment, resulting in a moderate decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the GDP decline would impact China’s domestic spending/consumption power moderately and lead to a medium-long term cooling of the China property market with rather big slow down of international commodity markets (spec. looking at Australia, New Zealand, South Africa)</p>\n\n<p>-&gt; moderate impact on international markets (few sectors only), less long-term effects, slow-paced decline of China’s core GDP</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.) Orderly containment - small spill over</strong></p>\n\n<p>Evergrande default spills over to a few selected property firms in China (with extra large debts). China’s gov steps in quickly and aggressively to ensure an orderly containment with a direct relief to calm down markets, resulting in a small decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the slight GDP decline would result in rather short-term consequences for China’s domestic spending/consumption power. The CCP would at least manage to keep China&#39;s property prices stable thus not affecting savings/wealth of the main street too significantly; the spill over effects would be barely visible.</p>\n\n<p>-&gt; only short-term / slight impact on international markets (selected sectors only)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/prw7it/chinas_growing_property_crisis_a_look_onto_a_few/","title":"China’s growing property crisis: a look onto a few spill over scenarios","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-20T15:56:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-20 15:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"prw7it","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/prw7it/chinas_growing_property_crisis_a_look_onto_a_few/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/prw7it/chinas_growing_property_crisis_a_look_onto_a_few/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"mekonsodre14","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mekonsodre14","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mekonsodre14","score":1317,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"拡大する中国の不動産危機：いくつかの波及効果のシナリオを考察する","the_new_excerpt":"前提として...\n\n * 中国の富の70％は不動産で保有されている（他の国の平均は2,000万円。20から\n   35%)\n\n * Evergrandeの国際的な支払い義務は木曜日に発生します。\n\n * 現在の中国のGDPの1/3は、建設・不動産関連の活動（建設業者、資材・商品）によって生み出されています。\n   現在の中国のGDPの1/3は、建設・不動産関連の活動によって生み出されている（建設業者、材料・商品、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"中国日益严重的房地产危机：看一看一些溢出的情况","the_new_excerpt":"假设...\n\n * 中国70%的财富是以房产形式持有的（其他地方的平均数是tw. 20%到\n   35%)\n\n *恒大的国际支付义务在周四到期\n\n * 当前中国GDP的1/3是由建筑和房地产相关活动创造的\n   建筑商、材料/商品......等活动。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"中國日益嚴重的房地產危機：看一看一些溢出的情況","the_new_excerpt":"假設...\n\n * 中國70%的財富是以房產形式持有的（其他地方的平均數是tw. 20%到\n   35%)\n\n *恆大的國際支付義務在週四到期\n\n * 當前中國GDP的1/3是由建築和房地產相關活動創造的\n   建築商、材料/商品......等活動。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1439830493390848005","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1439830493390848005","title":"AUSTRALIAN CONSTRUCTION WORKERS REVOLTING AGAINST VACCINE MANDATES \nhttps://t.co/t7pw9um3If","date":"September 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"オーストラリアの建設作業員がワクチン義務化に反旗を翻す \nhttps://t.co/t7pw9um3If","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"澳大利亚建筑工人反对接种疫苗的规定而起义 \nhttps://t.co/t7pw9um3If","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"澳大利亞建築工人反對接種疫苗的規定而起義 \nhttps://t.co/t7pw9um3If","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-prvhqw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prvhqw/the_oracle_of_omaha_has_spoken/","title":"The oracle of Omaha has spoken","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 20, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"オマハの神託を受けて","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"奥马哈的神谕已经说了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"奧馬哈的神諭已經說了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-prw7it","previousId":"TweetPost-1439830493390848005","nextId":"RedditPost-prvhqw","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/prw7it/chinas_growing_property_crisis_a_look_onto_a_few/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
