I now use a few stock research  sites to help me in choosing what stocks to buy. . I find them  helpful but maybe there are other ones that are useful to beginners. .  I’m sharing with you my list below. Please add any useful resources so other newbies can benefit as well. Thank you! ❤️</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wallstrank.com/?r=1\"><em>Wall St Rank</em></a><br/>\nI scan this a few times a week to quickly understand which stocks are loved by analysts on Wall Street. It helps me identify stocks predicted to spike in the following year. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/upgrades-downgrades\"><em>Marketwatch</em></a><br/>\nThis is the first site I check when I like a stock. It gives me a lot of summarized data about the company.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/\"><em>Yahoo Finance</em></a><br/>\nI use this to be updated about financial news. I both use the app and website, they are free to use and provide good information. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com/daily?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_i.e81.WTv7c2D2LmyIEN2O_nVep0qWyTqT0TeUh9v70-1635239079-0-gqNtZGzNAlCjcnBszQ69\"><em>Morning Brew</em></a><br/>\nThis is a daily newsletter that dives into the biggest business stories and economic events in casual language. I like how they explain topics<em>.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://Public.com\"><em>Public.com</em></a><br/>\nIt’s an ethical zero-commission trading app. I really like the user experience. . There’s no minimum deposit to open an account and it&#39;s easy to use for beginners like me. It’s unique because you can have conversations about stocks you are interested in. </p>\n\n<p>It  would be a great help for me and other novice investors if you could  share what tools/sites you use to conduct investment research, and please share why you use them as well.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qgsmxa/help_me_expand_my_toolkit_to_improve_my/","title":"Help me expand my toolkit to improve my investment research.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-27T11:25:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-27 11:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qgsmxa","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qgsmxa/help_me_expand_my_toolkit_to_improve_my/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qgsmxa/help_me_expand_my_toolkit_to_improve_my/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"BarTraditional6305","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BarTraditional6305","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"BarTraditional6305","score":140,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の投資調査を向上させるためのツールキットを増やすのに役立ちます。","the_new_excerpt":"パンデミックの時に株式投資を始めたのですが、初心者に最適なツールを決めるのに時間がかかりました。\n初心者に最適なツールを選ぶのに時間がかかりました。今では、いくつかの株式調査サイトを利用して\n今では、いくつかの株式調査サイトを利用して、どの銘柄を買うべきかを選んでいます。. 私はそれらを参考にしていますが、もしかしたら他にも\n初心者に便利なものは他にもあるのではないでしょうか？. 私はあなたと共有している...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"帮助我扩大我的工具箱，以提高我的投资研究。","the_new_excerpt":"我在大流行期间开始投资股票，花了一段时间来决定\n我花了一些时间来决定对一个初学者来说最好的工具。我现在使用一些股票研究网站来帮助\n我选择买什么股票。. 我觉得它们很有帮助，但也许还有\n其他对初学者有用的网站。. 我与你分享...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"幫助我擴大我的工具箱，以提高我的投資研究。","the_new_excerpt":"我在大流行期間開始投資股票，花了一段時間來決定\n我花了一些時間來決定對一個初學者來說最好的工具。我現在使用一些股票研究網站來幫助\n我選擇買什麼股票。. 我覺得它們很有幫助，但也許還有\n其他對初學者有用的網站。. 我與你分享...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qghbv3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qghbv3/tell_me_the_market_isnt_broken_without_telling_me/","title":"Tell me the market isn’t broken, without telling me the market isn’t broken.","date":"October 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"市場が壊れていないと言わずに、市場が壊れていないと言ってください。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"告诉我市场没有崩溃，而不告诉我市场没有崩溃。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"告訴我市場沒有崩潰，而不告訴我市場沒有崩潰。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qgrhgu","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qgrhgu/we_did_it_robinhood_user_count_and_revenue_per/","title":"We did it, Robinhood user count and revenue per user is no longer an uptrend","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 27, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"やりましたね、Robinhoodのユーザー数とユーザー一人当たりの収益はもはや上昇トレンドです。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们做到了，Robinhood用户数和每用户收入不再是上升趋势","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們做到了，Robinhood用戶數和每用戶收入不再是上升趨勢","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qgsmxa","previousId":"RedditPost-qghbv3","nextId":"RedditPost-qgrhgu","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qgsmxa/help_me_expand_my_toolkit_to_improve_my/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
