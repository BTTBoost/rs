I read alot in there about the stock market and various other things to educate myself but mainly how to make money legally. I got out 2019 with a newfound confidence and began working and investing every penny I had building my credit to &quot;excellent&quot;  and was doing GREAT. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward 2021, I&#39;m married with 3 dependents and ive had to pull all my investing money for emergencies  and had quit investing for a while throughout 2020. Ive been trying to invest again but have had the absolute worst luck in doing so recently...</p>\n\n<p>I work 2 jobs + day labor when I can and it&#39;s barely enough to scrape by. Once the rent/bills are paid I have around $200 left for gas,food, etc. This leaves nothing to invest so I took advantage of these last stimulus and have lost about 30% of it since investing again.  </p>\n\n<p>I had a dream I could turn this 2k into 10k to invest in the SPY and safe growth etfs/stocks and I&#39;m just watching the little money I have dwindle away. I&#39;m just tired of being broke and not being able to provide for my family like I want to. I wanna buy my mom a house 1 day, I wanna own a house for the family I started and the stock market seemed like the only way for a collosal fuck up with no education to have a decent life. </p>\n\n<p>So what should I do? Pull the little money I have left and buy a handful of etfs to check back on in 10 years? Or should i Shut my little bitch ass up and work 4 jobs for the next 30 years?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m6cp7u/can_someone_give_me_some_advice/","title":"Can someone give me some advice","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-16T22:59:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-16 22:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7c32dd84-6bad-56ce-a2b4-17298d426279","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6cp7u/can_someone_give_me_some_advice/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6cp7u/can_someone_give_me_some_advice/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"J_seven7","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/J_seven7","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"J_seven7","score":72,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"谁能给我一些建议","the_new_excerpt":"我从小就很穷，早年也很操蛋，进进出出的。\n在我2016-2019年入狱之前。我在里面读了很多关于股票\n市场和其他各种事情来教育自己，但主要是如何赚钱。\n合法的。我带着新的信心走出了2019年，开始工作...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰能給我一些建議","the_new_excerpt":"我從小就很窮，早年也很操蛋，進進出出的。\n在我2016-2019年入獄之前。我在裏面讀了很多關於股票\n市場和其他各種事情來教育自己，但主要是如何賺錢。\n合法的。我帶着新的信心走出了2019年，開始工作...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cabef2b0-6cb3-58c5-82a6-f7da348c21ee","excerpt":"This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme\nfor today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just\nignore the theme and/or post your arguments against TA…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m654ww/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_mar/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Mar 16, 2021","date":"March 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals 周二--2021年3月16日。","the_new_excerpt":"这是每天的讨论，所以任何与股票有关的东西都可以，但主题是什么？\n今天的主题是技术分析(TA)，但如果TA不是你的菜，那么只需\n忽略主题和/或发布你的反对TA的论点......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals 週二--2021年3月16日。","the_new_excerpt":"這是每天的討論，所以任何與股票有關的東西都可以，但主題是什麼？\n今天的主題是技術分析(TA)，但如果TA不是你的菜，那麼只需\n忽略主題和/或發佈你的反對TA的論點......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-aa7c7315-b247-55af-b8ba-46f7c1388ab7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6hpof/bill_gross_is_short_gme_selling_250_and_300_calls/","title":"Bill Gross is short GME.
