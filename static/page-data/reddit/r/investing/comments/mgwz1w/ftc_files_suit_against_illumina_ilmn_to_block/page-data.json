After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.</p>\n\n<p>It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. </p>\n\n<p>This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.</p>\n\n<p>Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ftc-challenges-illuminas-proposed-acquisition-of-liquid-biopsy-firm-grail-11617131491\">www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ftc-challenges-illuminas-proposed-acquisition-of-liquid-biopsy-firm-grail-11617131491</a></p>\n\n<p>Personally I believe this will take some time to wash out and I expect a bigger correction in ILMN stock. I believe this represents an opportunity for entries into a long position in ILMN. I have a hard time believing this merger won’t go through.</p>\n\n<p>Long $ILMN.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mgwz1w/ftc_files_suit_against_illumina_ilmn_to_block/","title":"FTC files suit against Illumina (ILMN) to block vertical integration with Grail","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-01T02:30:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-01 02:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"38897c6b-e5ab-5b91-9440-19357ccacf4b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mgwz1w/ftc_files_suit_against_illumina_ilmn_to_block/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mgwz1w/ftc_files_suit_against_illumina_ilmn_to_block/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Social_History","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Social_History","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Social_History","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"FTC对Illumina(ILMN)提起诉讼，阻止与Grail的垂直整合。","the_new_excerpt":"联邦贸易委员会不寻常地宣布，他们已经提交了\n诉讼，以阻止基因测序领导者Illumina（ILMN）与的71亿美元合并。\n液体活检公司Grail。\n\n有趣的是，Grail是作为ILMN的子公司成立的，并被剥离出来。在\n申请上市，圣杯... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"FTC對Illumina(ILMN)提起訴訟，阻止與Grail的垂直整合。","the_new_excerpt":"聯邦貿易委員會不尋常地宣佈，他們已經提交了\n訴訟，以阻止基因測序領導者Illumina（ILMN）與的71億美元合併。\n液體活檢公司Grail。\n\n有趣的是，Grail是作爲ILMN的子公司成立的，並被剝離出來。在\n申請上市，聖盃... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3195d9e6-023d-5b31-9a6a-7da268c92d8a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhf835/sec_opens_investigation_into_archegos_capital/","title":"SEC opens investigation into Archegos Capital trades that sparked $20 billion liquidation, report says...\"The investigation is routine following such a high-profile market event, and the probe may not lead to any allegations of wrongdoing...\" Nothing to see here folks!","date":"April 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"报道称，SEC对Archegos Capital引发200亿美元清算的交易展开调查...... \"在如此高调的市场事件之后，调查是例行公事，调查可能不会导致任何不法行为的指控......\" 没什么好看的，伙计们!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"報道稱，SEC對Archegos Capital引發200億美元清算的交易展開調查...... \"在如此高調的市場事件之後，調查是例行公事，調查可能不會導致任何不法行爲的指控......\" 沒什麼好看的，夥計們!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-386aab04-8234-5bf1-bc84-e4286ba993f2","excerpt":"I see many paper-handed individuals dumping their shares for cheap because OMG\nBB has missed its revenue expectations for Q4.
