They literally created a prosperous middle class. They have created the world&#39;s second largest economy from third world.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2021, Greater China housed <strong>the most billionaires worldwide in 2021</strong>. By comparison, 696 billionaires resided in the United States.  <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/299513/billionaires-top-countries/#:%7E:text=According%20to%20the%20Hurun%20Global,resided%20in%20the%20United%20States\">source</a></p>\n\n<p>China has emerged as the world&#39;s largest manufacturer according to the World Bank. <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html#_Toc12530869\">source</a></p>\n\n<p>Economic reforms and trade and investment liberalization have helped transform China into a major trading power. Chinese merchandise exports rose from $14 billion in 1979 to $2.5 trillion in 2018, while merchandise imports grew from $18 billion to $2.1 trillion. China&#39;s rapidly growing trade flows have made it <strong>an increasingly important (and often the largest) trading partner</strong> for many countries. According to China, it was <strong>the largest trading partner for 130 countries in 2013</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html#_Toc12530869\">source</a></p>\n\n<p>Today, the country is being rocked heavily. The Evergrande debt crisis is still unravelling (other major Chinese real estate companies are drowning in debt), there is shortage in many of the manufacturing items coming out of China (computer chips, precious metals etc.), they are under international pressures/(economic warfare?) from the USA and others, and now they are having energy blackouts throughout the country (?!).</p>\n\n<p>The country societal problems are rearing it&#39;s head - The ruling party restricting rights, and then the one child policy is beginning to show negative economic ramifications, in that, they have too much of an aging population.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling party are trying to fix all of their issues right now, with heavy debt restructuring revamping social programs. But right now it looks like China is being rocked with a lot of issues.</p>\n\n<p>China is eyeing expansion of power - making &quot;friends&quot; with the Taliban (and their $ trillion mineral wealth), African presence, war with Taiwan and seizure of Hong Kong. What will be the economic ramifications of those events to China, and to the world? Yet to be seen.</p>\n\n<p>Now, here is my question:</p>\n\n<p>Despite the above - <strong>China is still an economic powerhouse on the world stage</strong>. International <strong>Investors need China to remain as such, as China is economically intertwined</strong>  with too many sectors in this world.</p>\n\n<p>I, personally, am  still very bullish on China long term. But since it appears, that China is, honestly, under economic upheaval.</p>\n\n<p>Should someone who admires China&#39;s economic performance;</p>\n\n<p>Buy the dip now (while much of the equities are priced low)</p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p>does an intelligent assessment demand waiting until long term (1 year-ish)</p>\n\n<p>orshould one just avoid China as an investment as much as possible for as long as possible (at least until the dust settles with Hong Kong and Taiwan)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q0qrd3/investing_in_china_outlook_in_the_short_term_or/","title":"Investing in China; outlook in the short term or even long term?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-04T01:38:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-04 01:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q0qrd3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q0qrd3/investing_in_china_outlook_in_the_short_term_or/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q0qrd3/investing_in_china_outlook_in_the_short_term_or/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"MrIndira","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrIndira","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MrIndira","score":254,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"中国への投資、短期的な見通し、あるいは長期的な見通しは？","the_new_excerpt":"今、中国への投資については、中国に「関わらない」というのが一般的な考え方ですよね。\n中国です。\n\n中国という国は、今世紀に入ってから経済的な奇跡を起こしています。彼らは文字通り\n文字通り、豊かな中産階級を生み出しました。第三世界から世界第二位の経済大国を作り上げたのです。\n第三世界から世界第二位の経済大国を誕生させました。\n\nHurun誌によると...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在中国投资；短期甚至长期的前景？","the_new_excerpt":"我知道现在关于在中国投资的流行观念是 \"不要进入 \"中国。\n中国。\n\n中国作为一个国家，在本世纪是一个经济奇迹。他们\n事实上，他们创造了一个繁荣的中产阶级。他们创造了世界上的\n从第三世界的第二大经济体。\n\n根据《胡润百富》杂志的报道，中国的经济增长速度超过了美国。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在中國投資；短期甚至長期的前景？","the_new_excerpt":"我知道現在關於在中國投資的流行觀念是 \"不要進入 \"中國。\n中國。\n\n中國作爲一個國家，在本世紀是一個經濟奇蹟。他們\n事實上，他們創造了一個繁榮的中產階級。他們創造了世界上的\n從第三世界的第二大經濟體。\n\n根據《胡潤百富》雜誌的報道，中國的經濟增長速度超過了美國。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q0q5fh","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q0q5fh/from_may_post_never_went_through_400112k_in_less/","title":"From May, post never went through :( $400--$112k in less than 2 weeks|| 27,000% Gain","date":"October 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"5月からの投稿が通らなかった :( 2週間足らずで$400-$112k||| 27,000%の利益。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"从5月份开始，帖子就没有通过 :( 400--11.2万美元在不到2周的时间里。27,000%的收益。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"從5月份開始，帖子就沒有通過 :( 400--11.2萬美元在不到2周的時間裏。27,000%的收益。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q0fw65","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q0fw65/hows_my_investments_going/","title":"How’s my investments going","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 04, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私の投資はどうなっているのか","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的投资进展如何","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的投資進展如何","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q0qrd3","previousId":"RedditPost-q0q5fh","nextId":"RedditPost-q0fw65","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q0qrd3/investing_in_china_outlook_in_the_short_term_or/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
