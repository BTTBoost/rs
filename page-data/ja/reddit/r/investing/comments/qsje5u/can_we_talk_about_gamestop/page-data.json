I followed the GameStoo saga earlier this year and recently started looking again at the two big subreddits supporting it.</p>\n\n<p>To my understanding, the theory goes that the shorts never actually sold their positions (because they would have gone bankrupt), but instead used all sorts of trickery to delay and avoid. Some ppl, have caught on to this and are determined to hold the stock such that when the chickens come home to roost and the shorts are forced to close, will trigger, they’ll be able to skyrocket the price. I’ve seen claims that a single share could be worth millions.</p>\n\n<p>This of course sounds fantastical and far-fetched but would someone mind explaining how seemingly so many ppl have adopted this belief and are all-in on a once hated retail store? IE where are they wrong in their analysis? Is it just a case of the human factor not being realized; that once the price jumps a bit, ppl will start to sell, so the idea of holding into the 1000s plus is unrealistic?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qsje5u/can_we_talk_about_gamestop/","title":"Can we talk about GameStop?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-13T00:31:11.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-13 00:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qsje5u","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qsje5u/can_we_talk_about_gamestop/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qsje5u/can_we_talk_about_gamestop/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"MagicMan1990","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MagicMan1990","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MagicMan1990","score":46,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GameStopの話をしませんか？","the_new_excerpt":"私は投資の経験が浅いので、この件に関する議論を見逃していたら申し訳ありません。\n申し訳ありません。私は今年の初めにGameStooの武勇伝を追いかけていましたが、最近になって\nそれをサポートする2つの大きなサブレディットを再び見始めました。\n\n私の理解では、理論的には、ショートは実際には売られていない...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们能谈谈GameStop吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我对投资游戏有点陌生，所以如果我错过了关于这个问题的讨论，我很抱歉。\n这方面的讨论。我在今年早些时候关注了GameStoo的传奇故事，最近开始\n又开始关注支持它的两个大的subreddits。\n\n根据我的理解，理论上说，短线实际上从未卖出...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們能談談GameStop嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我對投資遊戲有點陌生，所以如果我錯過了關於這個問題的討論，我很抱歉。\n這方面的討論。我在今年早些時候關注了GameStoo的傳奇故事，最近開始\n又開始關注支持它的兩個大的subreddits。\n\n根據我的理解，理論上說，短線實際上從未賣出...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qsa3fj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsa3fj/im_still_smiling/","title":"I’m still smiling","date":"November 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私はまだ微笑んでいる","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我仍然微笑着","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我仍然微笑着","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qsje5u","previousId":"RedditPost-qsa3fj","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qsje5u/can_we_talk_about_gamestop/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
