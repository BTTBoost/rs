At this time, we understand that the unauthorized party obtained a list of email addresses for approximately five million people, and full names for a different group of approximately two million people. We also believe that for a more limited number of people—approximately 310 in total—additional personal information, including name, date of birth, and zip code, was exposed, with a subset of approximately 10 customers having more extensive account details revealed. We are in the process of making appropriate disclosures to affected people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>so ultimately 4 different groups compromised with different amounts of data leaked.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qppj3n/robinhood_had_a_security_breach_last_week/","title":"Robinhood had a security breach last week","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-09T04:40:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-09 04:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qppj3n","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qppj3n/robinhood_had_a_security_breach_last_week/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qppj3n/robinhood_had_a_security_breach_last_week/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"reaper527","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/reaper527","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"reaper527","score":99,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロビンフッドは先週、セキュリティ違反を起こしました。","the_new_excerpt":"メールを送り、様々な報道機関がこの話を取り上げ始めています。\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/robinhood-data-breach-exposes-data-on-millions-of-customers\n\nハッキングは11月3日（つまり先週の水曜日）に起こったようです。個人情報の流出はないとのことです。\n個人情報はないと言っていますが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Robinhood上周发生了安全漏洞","the_new_excerpt":"他们发出了电子邮件，各种新闻机构也开始报道这个故事。\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/robinhood-data-breach-exposes-data-on-millions-of-customers\n\n黑客显然发生在11/3（即上周三）。他们声称没有个人\n信息，而不是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Robinhood上週發生了安全漏洞","the_new_excerpt":"他們發出了電子郵件，各種新聞機構也開始報道這個故事。\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/robinhood-data-breach-exposes-data-on-millions-of-customers\n\n黑客顯然發生在11/3（即上週三）。他們聲稱沒有個人\n信息，而不是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qpoxh5","excerpt":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/bill-gates-hadn-t-sold-110000787.html\n\nWow, that is almost 700B today.\n\nOf course at the end of the day, it doesn't matter that much as he is still\nworth almost 130B, and don't think he will be losing his sleep over this.
