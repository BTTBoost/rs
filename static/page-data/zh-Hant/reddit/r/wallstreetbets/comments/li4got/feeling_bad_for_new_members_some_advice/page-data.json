I’ve been on this sub for 3 years.

No one is going to care for you if you go broke we are not privileged like Melvin. </p>\n\n<p>2) Down a lot on a stock? The question is would you buy more of that stock at that price. If the answer is yes hold, if no sell. </p>\n\n<p>2.5) find a stock that you think will perform better than your current investments? Sell a position and diversify</p>\n\n<p>3) Recognise when a stock is dead. If everyone says it’s going up. It’s reached the top. </p>\n\n<p>4) Diversify retard. At the end of the day long-term options and shares are the best bet.
