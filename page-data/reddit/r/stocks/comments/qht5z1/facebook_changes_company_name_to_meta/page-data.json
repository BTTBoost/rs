The company has indicated that augmented and virtual reality will be a key part of its strategy in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>In July, Facebook announced the formation of a team that would work on the metaverse, a classic sci-fi term Facebook has adopted to describe its vision for working and playing in a virtual world. Two months later, the company said it would elevate Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, who is currently the head of Facebook’s hardware division, to the role of chief technology officer in 2022. And in its third-quarter earnings results on Monday, the company announced that it break out Facebook Reality Labs, its hardware division, into its own reporting segment, starting in the fourth quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook also said this week it’d spend about $10 billion over the next year developing the technologies required for building the metaverse.</p>\n\n<p>Zuckerberg on Thursday also provided a demonstration of the company’s ambitions for the metaverse.</p>\n\n<p>The demo was a Pixar-like animation of software the company hopes to build some day. The demo included users hanging out in space as cartoon-like versions of themselves or fantastical characters, like a robot, that represent their virtual selves. </p>\n\n<p>Facebook changes company name to Meta <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-company-name-to-meta.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-company-name-to-meta.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qht5z1/facebook_changes_company_name_to_meta/","title":"Facebook changes company name to Meta","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-28T19:19:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-28 19:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qht5z1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qht5z1/facebook_changes_company_name_to_meta/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qht5z1/facebook_changes_company_name_to_meta/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"juaggo_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/juaggo_","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"juaggo_","score":1411,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Facebook、社名をMetaに変更","the_new_excerpt":"フェイスブックは12日、社名を変更することを発表しました。\n\nこの社名変更は、AR（拡張現実）およびVR（仮想現実）に関するカンファレンス「Facebook Connect」で発表されました。\n今回の社名変更は、ソーシャル・メディア以外の分野での事業拡大を反映したものです。\nソーシャルメディアを超えた野心を反映したものです。\n\nここ数年、Facebookは、ソーシャルメディア以外の分野での取り組みを強化してきました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Facebook将公司名称改为Meta","the_new_excerpt":"Facebook周四宣布，它将改变其公司名称。\n\n这一名称的改变是在Facebook Connect增强和虚拟现实会议上宣布的。\n虚拟现实会议上宣布的，反映了该公司在社交媒体之外不断增长的野心。\n脸书在社交媒体之外的野心越来越大。\n\n在过去的几年里，该公司已经加大了其努力...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Facebook將公司名稱改爲Meta","the_new_excerpt":"Facebook週四宣佈，它將改變其公司名稱。\n\n這一名稱的改變是在Facebook Connect增強和虛擬現實會議上宣佈的。\n虛擬現實會議上宣佈的，反映了該公司在社交媒體之外不斷增長的野心。\n臉書在社交媒體之外的野心越來越大。\n\n在過去的幾年裏，該公司已經加大了其努力...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qhn24j","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhn24j/cant_go_tits_up/","title":"Can’t go tits up","date":"October 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"このままではいけない","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"不可能一塌糊涂","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不可能一塌糊塗","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1453790289903198210","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1453790289903198210","title":"Facebook changing it’s name to Meta https://t.co/n2rLZa2Qnj","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 28, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"Meta https://t.co/n2rLZa2Qnj に名称変更するFacebook。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"Facebook改名为Meta https://t.co/n2rLZa2Qnj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"Facebook改名爲Meta https://t.co/n2rLZa2Qnj","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qht5z1","previousId":"RedditPost-qhn24j","nextId":"TweetPost-1453790289903198210","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qht5z1/facebook_changes_company_name_to_meta/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
