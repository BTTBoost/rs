We do have some upcoming interesting events that could propel it forward in the short to medium termt though. I&#39;ve summarized below to share with you.</p>\n\n<p>In the updated $Carvana and $ROOT Commercial Agreement they state that the Product Integration Plan will be completed within 30 days from commencement date which is Oct 1st. If Carvana buying up to 30% of the company for prices up to 6x the current share price doesn&#39;t excite you, then I do not know what will! Root issued this 30% in 8 short/long term warrants exercisable at $10-$30/share and up to 129M shares of Class A common stock which represents the 30% of Root ownership fully diluted as of Aug 2021. As we have seen posted many time, there is a strong assumption that an acquisition could take place in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>Root is aware they need to reduce costs and are doing so both on the selling and general admin cost side but also by using their new tech, i.e. UBI 4.0. Expect to hear about these results soon.</p>\n\n<p>Look I don&#39;t know what is going to happen, but Root looks primed for the long term turn around darling backed by Carvana. If we could get a solid retail base it would speed up the increased share price. I&#39;m looking for $27+ which was the IPO price only 1 year ago.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Possible catalysts:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>- Technical Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a 1 year falling wedge pattern lets break it out!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4ostsgreq1t71.png?width=1923&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea8f3587fa2879efac2afbe984b4b5edd0175f1\">1Y1D Falling Wedge</a></p>\n\n<p>1Y1D Falling Wedge</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Oct 15th Call Expiration</strong></p>\n\n<p>Massive open interest for expiration this Friday, mainly out of the money though.

Lots will tell you predictions on that but I will not.
