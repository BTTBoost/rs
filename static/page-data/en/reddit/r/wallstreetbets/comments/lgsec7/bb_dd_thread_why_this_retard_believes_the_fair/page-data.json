Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future</p>\n\n<p>2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.</p>\n\n<p>Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).</p>\n\n<p>THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst <strong>BB sat at a juicy 10.15%</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/just\">u/just</a> an everyday life couldn&#39;t have put it better: &quot;Zombie cars and QNX</p>\n\n<p>QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who&#39;s not a software genius, I&#39;ve done some research so we all know what we&#39;re getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn&#39;t exactly anything that&#39;s significantly more important than the others. However, when you&#39;re using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn&#39;t develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who&#39;s OS are they using?</p>\n\n<p>SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you&#39;ll see XPEV is using DESAY&#39;s autopilot program that&#39;s built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There&#39;s no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn&#39;t even matter.</p>\n\n<p>You might have noticed that I didn&#39;t mention Tesla at all. That&#39;s because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀&quot;</p>\n\n<p>3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. </p>\n\n<p>BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. <a href=\"/u/Tradergurue\">u/Tradergurue</a> went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here <a href=\"https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/\">https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/</a> </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgsec7/bb_dd_thread_why_this_retard_believes_the_fair/","title":"$BB DD thread: Why this retard believes the fair market value for $BB is $45.
