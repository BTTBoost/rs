Before everyone thinks ok boomer or that I&#39;m some value investor dumping my entire net worth into BABA I&#39;m not. I&#39;m asking on a theoretical level.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, valuations and fundamentals have mattered because the big institutions and the average retail investor thought they mattered. Even algos, which on some level were active at the onset of the 80&#39;s were programmed and directed to sell off stock when the valuation became too absurd. </p>\n\n<p>But when I look at the Rivians and Nikolas of the world I start to think maybe they&#39;re just a symptom of the larger mentality of the market, including institutions, including the algos that are programmed by humans that have normal human biases.</p>\n\n<p>Theoretically, if the larger consensus of the market.. from institutions to retail to the programmers making algos, was that only future potential growth mattered and nothing else, wouldn&#39;t that theoretically mean that only growth and hype stocks would have growth and interest forever? </p>\n\n<p>I mean on a purely theoretical level, if we reached a point where it was a consensus by the vast majority of investors from all levels and backgrounds was that speculation and growth wins the day, wouldn&#39;t the market reflect that?</p>\n\n<p>What I mean to say is the market can be a reflection of the risk appetite of the broad spectrum of humans investing and trading in it, and if that were to slowly shift would it be possible that value stocks or old blue chips are largely forgotten forever, or have a bad return versus hype/speculation/growth moving forward?</p>\n\n<p>If no one is a Warren Buffett anymore, why would Warren Buffett-esque stocks have any market beating returns? No one would invest in them (on a level compared to hype/speculation stocks). They&#39;d just theoretically sit there at low valuations forever paying out dividends and what not, with their only real growth being from stock buy backs.</p>\n\n<p>Just a musing I had.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qtn82y/do_valuations_and_fundamentals_matter_anymore/","title":"Do valuations and fundamentals matter anymore?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-14T15:38:53.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-14 15:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qtn82y","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qtn82y/do_valuations_and_fundamentals_matter_anymore/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qtn82y/do_valuations_and_fundamentals_matter_anymore/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Stacks_McDividend","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Stacks_McDividend","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Stacks_McDividend","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"バリュエーションやファンダメンタルズはもはや重要なのか？","the_new_excerpt":"純粋にそう思います。誰もがOKブーマーだと思ったり、私が価値ある投資家だと思ったりする前に\nBABA に全財産を投じる投資家だと思われる前に、私はそうではありません。私は理論的なレベルで質問しているのです。\n理論的なレベルの質問です。\n\n過去にバリュエーションやファンダメンタルズが重要だったのは、大手機関投資家や一般の個人投資家が考えていたからです。\nバリュエーションやファンダメンタルズが重要だったのは、大手機関投資家や一般の個人投資家が...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"估值和基本面还重要吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我真的很想知道这一点。在每个人都认为我是一个好的潮人，或者认为我是一个价值投资者，把我的全部净资产都投入到BABA，我不是。\n投资人将我的全部净资产投入BABA，我不是。我是在问一个\n理论层面的问题。\n\n在过去，估值和基本面都很重要，因为大机构和普通散户投资者都认为。\n机构和普通散户投资者认为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"估值和基本面還重要嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我真的很想知道這一點。在每個人都認爲我是一個好的潮人，或者認爲我是一個價值投資者，把我的全部淨資產都投入到BABA，我不是。\n投資人將我的全部淨資產投入BABA，我不是。我是在問一個\n理論層面的問題。\n\n在過去，估值和基本面都很重要，因爲大機構和普通散戶投資者都認爲。\n機構和普通散戶投資者認爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qtjfbl","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtjfbl/unreleased_footage_fed_reserve_during_weekend/","title":"Unreleased Footage: Fed Reserve During Weekend","date":"November 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"未公開映像のご紹介 週末のFRB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"未发布的片段。周末的美联储","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"未發佈的片段。週末的美聯儲","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qtq4lx","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qtq4lx/how_the_market_has_been_over_the_past_month/","title":"How the market has been over the past month","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 14, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"この1ヶ月間の市場の状況","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"过去一个月的市场情况如何","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"過去一個月的市場情況如何","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qtn82y","previousId":"RedditPost-qtjfbl","nextId":"RedditPost-qtq4lx","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qtn82y/do_valuations_and_fundamentals_matter_anymore/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
