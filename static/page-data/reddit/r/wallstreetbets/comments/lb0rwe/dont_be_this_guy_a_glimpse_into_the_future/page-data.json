You&#39;re content.</p>\n\n<p>You sold your GME shares at small loss at the start of the week as you continued to watch the share price plummet due to market manipulation. You got out, you survived. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s 9:28am, you&#39;re returning from the school run. Your BMW 1 series seats make you feel safe and important. Your house, although small, is affordable and the mortgage repayments don&#39;t put too much pressure on your paper wallet. </p>\n\n<p>Your phone goes off as you enter the house. You sit on the sofa and turn on NBC as you open Whatsapp. You have 17 unread messages. </p>\n\n<p>Your eyes pan up, the news anchor is shouting. You read the title at the bottom of the screen - &#39;The Short Squeeze Is Happening&quot;. Jim Cramer is crying. You quickly open your Whatsapp group chat and only see dollar signs being spammed by your friends. You open Yahoo Finance and see the share price at 600.87, it&#39;s still rising. Your heart skips a beat. You open I-phone calculator and work out that your 17 shares would now be worth just over 10,000 US dollars. You feel sick.</p>\n\n<p>The share price is still rising. You receive a call from your best friend Mickey, he&#39;s crying too. He&#39;s telling you about how you were right and he&#39;ll be able to pay off his student loan soon. Also his wife is pregnant. You congratulate him with a fickle grin and fake laugh. You look back down at your phone, 828.16. 830.00, 838.26. </p>\n\n<p>WallStreetBets has crashed due to the traffic. </p>\n\n<p>You realise everything you stood for is coming true, but you paper handed too soon. </p>\n\n<p>You ignored the threads, the experts. You ignored DeepFuckingValue. </p>\n\n<p>You ignored your god given right to a better life for you and your wifes boyfriend. </p>\n\n<p>You try to buy back in, but you have no money. You begin to laugh, and laugh. Despair and anguish turn into humour. </p>\n\n<p>You pull the Glock from your $16 AliExpress safe and load it. You hold it to your head, you shiver. </p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t pull the trigger. Your paper hands can&#39;t do it, and never will be able to do anything of any meaningful value. You drop the gun and admit defeat. </p>\n\n<p>As the camera pans out of your window and over your neighborhood, we see Wall St burning in flames in the distance. The transfer of wealth begins, fade to black.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: DON&#39;T BE THAT GUY 💎💎💎💎💎💎</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb0rwe/dont_be_this_guy_a_glimpse_into_the_future/","title":"Don't be this guy - a glimpse into the future","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T01:30:17.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 01:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a85bebd1-1a65-5c09-9cdf-ed4556dc8b90","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb0rwe/dont_be_this_guy_a_glimpse_into_the_future/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb0rwe/dont_be_this_guy_a_glimpse_into_the_future/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"FireRngesus","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/FireRngesus","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"FireRngesus","score":42464,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不要成为这种人--对未来的一瞥","the_new_excerpt":"闭上你的眼睛。今天是星期五，阳光透过窗帘照射进来，而你正在...\n吃着你的Weetabix，心中无忧无虑。你很满足。\n\n你在本周初以小幅亏损的价格卖出了GME的股票，因为你继续\n看着股价因市场操纵而暴跌。你有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要成爲這種人--對未來的一瞥","the_new_excerpt":"閉上你的眼睛。今天是星期五，陽光透過窗簾照射進來，而你正在...\n喫着你的Weetabix，心中無憂無慮。你很滿足。\n\n你在本週初以小幅虧損的價格賣出了GME的股票，因爲你繼續\n看着股價因市場操縱而暴跌。你有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bc157dd2-5639-5ed6-8204-17ee9bba89cc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8jtk/wsb_right_now/","title":"WSB right now","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WSB现在","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"WSB現在","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6129cdb0-24ab-5af6-83e4-a09398879052","excerpt":"Let me start by saying r/stocks [/r/stocks] seems a lot more civilized than WSB\n- I feel like i'll get an informed answer here.\n\nI'll be honest and admit yesterday i got rather excited around the AMC hype and\nbought 50 shares at 13.50.\n\nPre-market is looking fairly bleak however with the constant…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lav4vg/current_situation_with_amc/","title":"Current situation with AMC?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 03, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AMC的现状？","the_new_excerpt":"首先我要说的是r/stocks[/r/stocks]似乎比WSB文明多了。\n- 我觉得我在这里会得到一个明智的答案。\n\n老实说，我承认昨天我对AMC的炒作颇为兴奋，而且我也不知道该怎么办。\n在13.50买入50股。\n\n前市场看起来相当黯淡，然而随着不断...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMC的現狀？","the_new_excerpt":"首先我要說的是r/stocks[/r/stocks]似乎比WSB文明多了。\n- 我覺得我在這裏會得到一個明智的答案。\n\n老實說，我承認昨天我對AMC的炒作頗爲興奮，而且我也不知道該怎麼辦。\n在13.50買入50股。\n\n前市場看起來相當黯淡，然而隨着不斷...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-a85bebd1-1a65-5c09-9cdf-ed4556dc8b90","previousId":"RedditPost-bc157dd2-5639-5ed6-8204-17ee9bba89cc","nextId":"RedditPost-6129cdb0-24ab-5af6-83e4-a09398879052","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb0rwe/dont_be_this_guy_a_glimpse_into_the_future/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
