These are just observations from an experienced investor and FP&amp;A analyst.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr: The more readily available the so-called &quot;stock analysis/deep dive&quot;, the greater the skepticism it warrants.</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is no end to the number of blogs and Youtube videos that convince retail investors they too can be experts.  But what, really, is the value of that information?</p>\n\n<p>There are three reasons earnings-based analyses are so popular in the investing world, even among some quasi-professionals, despite the fact that Discounted Cash Flow analysis is the preferred model for valuation across the entire industry<sup>1</sup>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Earnings is the most readily available company metric on the internet.</li>\n<li>Ratios are simple; analyses are complicated.</li>\n<li>This information is cheap.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Beyond Time Value of Money, there&#39;s no more valuable information you&#39;re going to get from browsing the internet for free.  You can get access to certain types of research reports from Schwab and other discount brokerages, but it&#39;s not &quot;free&quot;.  You&#39;ve deposited money with and given order flow to these institutions, on which they in turn generate income.  But this is still relatively low value information compared to real, thorough equity research (it&#39;s often called &quot;Due Diligence&quot; here).  These reports cost money, and they&#39;re compiled by people with years of education and expertise, which in turn cost money.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m sitting here next to a stack of just four books from my college years a quarter century ago:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>Fundamentals of Financial Management</em> by Eugene F. Brigham.</li>\n<li><em>Management Accounting</em> by Anthony Atkinson &amp; Rajiv Banker (my professor).</li>\n<li>Smith and Roberson&#39;s <em>Business Law.</em></li>\n<li><em>Security Analysis</em> by Dodd and Graham.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The fourth is by far the cheapest of them, because it&#39;s more widely used than in academia.  But together, these four books would today cost, in their hardcover editions, $1000... and that&#39;s just four introductory textbooks.  Nevermind the 4-5 years of school I had studying the soup-to-nuts of business management and, at the end of it, writing a thesis for a strategy formulation and implementation class that utilized all of the other learned disciplines in the development of a single, semester-long business case.</p>\n\n<p>Very little of what analysts know in practice is something that can be distilled to the average investor without all of the years of underlying context.   Expecting you to digest this and beat the market would be like telling you to take a 5xxx or 7xxx level finance course and expecting you to place in the top 5% of the class, at a top 5% school.</p>\n\n<p>So this is what really goes into business valuation exercises of any real worth.  Which is another way of saying: If you didn&#39;t pay for it, chances are it&#39;s not that valuable.</p>\n\n<p>*****</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Brigham, Eugene. <em>Fundamentals of Financial Management: Seventh Ed.</em>, p. 196.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In fact, of all the concepts used in finance, none is more important than the time value of money or discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/prc1de/no_free_lunch_a_brief_primer_on_the_cost_vs_value/","title":"No Free Lunch: A Brief Primer on the Cost vs. Value of Information","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-20T03:20:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-20 03:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"prc1de","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/prc1de/no_free_lunch_a_brief_primer_on_the_cost_vs_value/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/prc1de/no_free_lunch_a_brief_primer_on_the_cost_vs_value/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"th3cr1t1c","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/th3cr1t1c","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"th3cr1t1c","score":71,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"No Free Lunch: 情報のコストと価値についての簡単な入門書","the_new_excerpt":"注意：この文書は広告でも勧誘でもありませんし、解釈されるものでもありません。\n財務上のアドバイスとして解釈されるものではありません。これは、経験豊富な投資家およびFP&Aアナリストの見解に過ぎません。\n投資家やFP&Aアナリストとしての経験に基づく見解です。\n\ntl;dr: いわゆる「株式分析/深堀り」が容易に入手できればできるほど、懐疑的になる。\n懐疑的な見方をしてしまうものです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"没有免费的午餐。关于信息的成本与价值的简要介绍","the_new_excerpt":"注意：这既不是广告，也不是招揽，更不能被理解为财务建议。\n解释为财务建议。这些只是一个有经验的投资者和FP&A分析师的观察\n投资者和FP&A分析师的观察。\n\ntl;dr: 所谓的 \"股票分析/深入研究 \"越容易获得，就越容易被怀疑。\n怀疑的程度就越大......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"沒有免費的午餐。關於信息的成本與價值的簡要介紹","the_new_excerpt":"注意：這既不是廣告，也不是招攬，更不能被理解爲財務建議。\n解釋爲財務建議。這些只是一個有經驗的投資者和FP&A分析師的觀察\n投資者和FP&A分析師的觀察。\n\ntl;dr: 所謂的 \"股票分析/深入研究 \"越容易獲得，就越容易被懷疑。\n懷疑的程度就越大......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1439616698227769349","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1439616698227769349","title":"The average person says “today’s the nicest day of the year” 37 times a year.","date":"September 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"平均的な人は1年に37回、「今日は1年で一番いい日だ」と言います。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"普通人一年中说 \"今天是一年中最美好的一天 \"37次。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"普通人一年中說 \"今天是一年中最美好的一天 \"37次。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-prhnu5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prhnu5/if_evergrande_would_be_a_13_second_video/","title":"If Evergrande would be a 13 second video","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 20, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Evergrandeが13秒の動画になったら","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"如果恒大将是一个13秒的视频","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果恆大將是一個13秒的視頻","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-prc1de","previousId":"TweetPost-1439616698227769349","nextId":"RedditPost-prhnu5","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/prc1de/no_free_lunch_a_brief_primer_on_the_cost_vs_value/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
