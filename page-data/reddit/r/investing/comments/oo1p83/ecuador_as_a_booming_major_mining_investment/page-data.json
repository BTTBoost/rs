But as mining jurisdictions in countries like Chile, Peru, and others become more complicated, Ecuador is going on a different route and is rather shifting to a heavy mining-friendly stance. The newly-elected president, Guillermo Lasso (succeeding Lenin Moreno), <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/pro-foreign-investment-lasso-wins-ecuador-presidential-election/\">has a positive stance towards mining</a> and campaigns to promote foreign investments in the mining and oil sectors, while cutting tariffs on agricultural and other heavy equipment.</p>\n\n<p>According to an <a href=\"https://coringmagazine.com/article/challenge-opportunity-ecuador/\">article</a> by Merlin Marr-Johnson, Executive Vice President at Salazar Resources Ltd., “Mining is the only Ecuadorian industry that offers growth potential as agriculture, tourism and the oil industry are ex-growth with structural problems, and the mining industry is keen to invest heavily and generate future earnings.” This is obviously acknowledged by a number of companies by engaging in drilling and exploration projects in the country. Here are some:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lundin Gold (</strong><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/lug.to/\"><strong>LUG.TO</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n\n<p>They are mainly focused on the <a href=\"https://www.lundingold.com/en/fruta-del-norte/project-overview/\">Fruta Del Norte gold mine</a> in the country, inaugurating it in November 2019. The company purchased the Fruta del Norte gold deposit in late 2014 and now has 100% ownership of it, 8 years after it was discovered. It is situated within a 150 km long copper–gold metallogenic sub-province located in the Cordillera del Cóndor region in south eastern Ecuador. Its first gold production was reached in November 2019 and commercial production was achieved in February 2020.</p>\n\n<p>There was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, but they <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lundin-gold-delivers-another-quarter-123000622.html\">recently announced</a> the production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solaris Resources (</strong><a href=\"https://miningfeeds.com/stock/solaris-resources-inc.-tsx/\"><strong>SLS.TO</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The flagship project in Ecuador, which is the Warintza project, is focused on the Warintza Central resource, which covers ~700m of a 5km x 5km cluster of copper porphyries. The area hosts a high-grade open pit resource within a 5km trend of outcropping copper porphyry mineralization, with a number of untested, large-scale gold-in-soil and geophysical anomalies. It is adjacent to the +1Bt San Carlos-Panantza copper deposits and is the same belt as the Fruta del Norte and Mirador mines. Drilling the area<a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/solaris-commences-maiden-drilling-at-warintza-east-major-porphyry-target-defined-at-yawi-866745755.html\"> already commenced</a> and<a href=\"https://www.mining.com/solaris-resources-reports-high-grade-intercepts-at-warintza-in-ecuador/\"> recently reported high-grade intercepts</a> in the area.</p>\n\n<p>Their shares<a href=\"https://www.northernminer.com/stock-markets-investing/tsx-up-july-5-9/1003832739/\"> recently rose</a> from $1.47 to $13.24, since the company released more assays from its flagship Warintza copper-gold project in southeastern Ecuador, about 85 km east of the city of Cuenca.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Ecuador is going to be an excellent hotspot for mining companies because of its resources. But it will definitely benefit the country as well. There will be more jobs for the people because of the establishment of mining clusters, and will definitely bring more life to the economy and promote technological innovation.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oo1p83/ecuador_as_a_booming_major_mining_investment/","title":"Ecuador as a booming major mining investment destination","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-20T14:40:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-20 14:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a6ae6486-3b09-5244-85fe-decdfcaf7c53","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oo1p83/ecuador_as_a_booming_major_mining_investment/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oo1p83/ecuador_as_a_booming_major_mining_investment/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"morsingguirlandea1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/morsingguirlandea1","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"morsingguirlandea1","score":545,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"主要な鉱山投資先として期待されるエクアドル","the_new_excerpt":"ラテンアメリカは、様々な金属や鉱物の供給源として知られているため、鉱山会社にとってはホットスポットとして知られています。\n様々な金属や鉱物の宝庫として知られているからです。しかし、チリやペルーなどの\nチリやペルーなどの国の管轄が複雑になってきています。\nエクアドルはそれとは別の道を歩んでおり、どちらかというと...にシフトしています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"厄瓜多尔是一个蓬勃发展的主要矿业投资目的地","the_new_excerpt":"众所周知，拉丁美洲是采矿公司的一个热点，因为它是各种金属和矿物的重要来源。\n众所周知，它是各种金属和矿物的重要来源。但是，随着智利、秘鲁等国的采矿\n智利、秘鲁和其他国家的管辖权变得更加复杂。\n厄瓜多尔正在走一条不同的路线，而是转向...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"厄瓜多爾是一個蓬勃發展的主要礦業投資目的地","the_new_excerpt":"衆所周知，拉丁美洲是採礦公司的一個熱點，因爲它是各種金屬和礦物的重要來源。\n衆所周知，它是各種金屬和礦物的重要來源。但是，隨着智利、祕魯等國的採礦\n智利、祕魯和其他國家的管轄權變得更加複雜。\n厄瓜多爾正在走一條不同的路線，而是轉向...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-953c4e9d-c80f-5bc2-b2de-61d536103457","excerpt":"I'm not referring to a pump and dump, merely the act of few participants\ninfluencing the price through direct buy force.\n\nThis might be a dumb question, but I'm curious as to how much power these guys\nreally have.","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ony0ah/is_it_perfectly_legal_for_a_hedge_fund_to_inflate/","title":"Is it perfectly legal for a hedge fund to inflate a stock price through ridiculous amounts of money, and then sell after it's peaked?","date":"July 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ヘッジファンドが莫大な資金を投入して株価を膨らませ、ピークに達した後に売却することは、完全に合法なのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"ポンプ・アンド・ダンプではなく、少数の参加者が直接買い付けて価格に影響を与える行為に過ぎません。\n価格に直接影響を与える行為です。\n\nくだらない質問かもしれませんが、この人たちが実際にどのくらいの力を持っているのか興味があります。\n疑問に思っています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对冲基金通过荒唐的资金来抬高股价，然后在股价达到顶峰后再卖出，这是否完全合法？","the_new_excerpt":"我指的不是抽水和倾倒，只是少数参与者的行为\n通过直接购买力影响价格的行为。\n\n这可能是一个愚蠢的问题，但我很好奇，这些人到底有多大的权力？\n真正拥有多少权力。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對沖基金通過荒唐的資金來擡高股價，然後在股價達到頂峯後再賣出，這是否完全合法？","the_new_excerpt":"我指的不是抽水和傾倒，只是少數參與者的行爲\n通過直接購買力影響價格的行爲。\n\n這可能是一個愚蠢的問題，但我很好奇，這些人到底有多大的權力？\n真正擁有多少權力。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-3d522d00-4076-5bbb-bd1f-e95503076551","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oo1w2t/actual_footage_of_jeff_bezos_flight_to_space/","title":"Actual Footage of Jeff Bezos Flight to Space…","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 20, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ジェフ・ベゾスの宇宙飛行の実写映像...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"杰夫-贝佐斯飞往太空的实际镜头...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"傑夫-貝佐斯飛往太空的實際鏡頭...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-a6ae6486-3b09-5244-85fe-decdfcaf7c53","previousId":"RedditPost-953c4e9d-c80f-5bc2-b2de-61d536103457","nextId":"RedditPost-3d522d00-4076-5bbb-bd1f-e95503076551","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oo1p83/ecuador_as_a_booming_major_mining_investment/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
