Had a solid strategy that was making me gains that I was proud of and I was steadily growing towards my goal. </p>\n\n<p>I made the worst mistake jumping on the AMC trend and it shattered my portfolio. Pretty much what I deserve from following the trend and deviating from my strategy, but it’s demoralizing to say the least. My portfolio went from up 110% to down 50%, so I’ve lost half my original investment. </p>\n\n<p>Since then, I can’t seem to do anything correct to get back green. Each day I’m losing more and getting more discouraged. </p>\n\n<p>Any advice from people who have been in a similar situation, lost a bunch of gains and are currently negative? </p>\n\n<p>It took me like 6 months to get over that “FOMO” mindset. The second I followed it again, I pretty much lost it all. </p>\n\n<p>Just looking for any suggestions or advice on what I should do. Should I pull my money out for now until I get over this discouraged feeling? Should I just keep trying? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lpz4xo/the_whole_gmeamc_trend_completely_derailed_my/","title":"The whole GME/AMC trend completely derailed my plans and strategy.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-22T22:39:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-22 22:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"212d9ab4-3556-52d8-9203-0358525cfb52","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lpz4xo/the_whole_gmeamc_trend_completely_derailed_my/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lpz4xo/the_whole_gmeamc_trend_completely_derailed_my/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"GingerWalnutt","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GingerWalnutt","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GingerWalnutt","score":1069,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"整个GME/AMC的趋势完全破坏了我的计划和策略。","the_new_excerpt":"我有这么好的一年，涨幅超过100%。有一个稳健的策略，是让我\n的收获，我为之骄傲，我正朝着我的目标稳步成长。\n\n我犯了一个最严重的错误，跳上了AMC的趋势，它打碎了我的投资组合。\n跟随潮流，偏离潮流，几乎是我应得的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"整個GME/AMC的趨勢完全破壞了我的計劃和策略。","the_new_excerpt":"我有這麼好的一年，漲幅超過100%。有一個穩健的策略，是讓我\n的收穫，我爲之驕傲，我正朝着我的目標穩步成長。\n\n我犯了一個最嚴重的錯誤，跳上了AMC的趨勢，它打碎了我的投資組合。\n跟隨潮流，偏離潮流，幾乎是我應得的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b12f6d87-6000-5b2d-b56e-23f5862f26ff","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpum6d/bb_holders_right_now/","title":"$BB holders right now","date":"February 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$BB持有人现在","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"$BB持有人現在","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a8465110-f529-549e-97ac-c893a95fba4b","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpxl2c/the_wolf_of_wallstreetbets_trailer_created_this/","title":"The Wolf of WallStreetBets Trailer - Created this for the community","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 22, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WallStreetBets的狼 - 为社区创建的预告片","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"WallStreetBets的狼 - 爲社區創建的預告片","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-212d9ab4-3556-52d8-9203-0358525cfb52","previousId":"RedditPost-b12f6d87-6000-5b2d-b56e-23f5862f26ff","nextId":"RedditPost-a8465110-f529-549e-97ac-c893a95fba4b","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lpz4xo/the_whole_gmeamc_trend_completely_derailed_my/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
