An additional 241,745 filed claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, for gig and self-employed workers.  </p>\n\n<p>The total number of claims for all types of unemployment benefits was 18.95 million for the week ending March 6, according to Department of Labor <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf\">data</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The surge in new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations has slowed in recent weeks, though health officials are eyeing states that have removed restrictions on businesses and mask-wearing. The United States has seen a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=sf_coronavirus_subnav\">4 percent rise in new cases</a> in the past week.  </p>\n\n<p>But Americans are still holding out hope that increasingly broadened access to the coronavirus vaccines are the key to returning to work, more job availability, and an improved economy.
