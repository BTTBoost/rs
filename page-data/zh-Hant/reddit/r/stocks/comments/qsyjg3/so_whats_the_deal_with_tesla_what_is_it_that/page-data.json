My gut feeling tells me that if everyone flocks to one thing, there must be something fishy about it all.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t lie, I&#39;ve been tempted time and time again to jump in, seeing my friends make 10% in a single day and what not. I guess I am only human. However, after reading the works of Buffet, Howard Marks, Munger, and those gentlemen (which i consider my teachers), Tesla just seems to go against their philosophy; especially when it comes to the margin of safety principle.</p>\n\n<p>Now Tesla is a special case, if we look at Tesla as a company, their debt is consistently decreasing, equity and profits are growing like crazy, all of that is good. It&#39;s just the valuation. Currently at a P/E of ~300 for instance, it means they have A LOT to back up for in the near future and the public obviously has high hopes in them. But my question is, what exactly is this hope? I am not very informed about Tesla, neither am I an engineer, which is why I wanna hear some of your opinions about them.</p>\n\n<p>- What is their specific moat when it comes to the electric cars? How will this moat be protected by other automobile dealers? (i.e the Germans, Ford, the Chinese, etc...) Is it just their brand or do they have superior technology that will actually be hard to replicate/improve by other companies in the coming 10 years?</p>\n\n<p>- What other ventures are they going into besides cars? Is it A.I? What constitutes as A.I? If it is a personal robot who does the dishes for you and cleans your house, in what way will they have superior engineers compared to the other giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft? And why will they perform better than them?</p>\n\n<p>Basically, what is it that they do that makes people so confident in them, and what is it that accounts for this valuation?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qsyjg3/so_whats_the_deal_with_tesla_what_is_it_that/","title":"So...
