Automotives market is the first sector where it&#39;s gonna reflect the most. Financial Times and IHS Markit said car production of Honda, Toyota, FCA, GM and Ford will slow down and lots of money are going to be lost. Companies that can produce new generation microchip (7 and 5 nm) are INTEL, SAMSUNG and TSMC. Between the three Intel is the one who&#39;s struggling the most. Other than those three, Apple, Arm, Nvidia and Qualcomm play a big part in the game, but they actually design the chips and make TSMC to produce them. Trenforce, mentioned by Bloomberg, said that 56% of the gains from microchip worldwide income has been generated by TSMC. That&#39;s due to commercial war between US and China.  To prevent sanctions and duties, companies cancelled orders to China making workload of other companies outside China raised (or raising? I&#39;m not english). Sony, Microsoft  are saying that market is slowing down a bit for them aswell. Meanwhile TSMC has announced in the past weeks that they&#39;ve managed to increase their productive power.</p>\n\n<p>I use DEGIRO and I&#39;m not allowed to buy TSMC. If I could, I would to it. TSMC it&#39;s cheap. But you might be interested and I just wanted to be part of this give and take game</p>\n\n<p>Hugs</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/le4zlk/tsmc_a_newbe_sort_of_dd/","title":"$TSMC - a newbe sort of DD","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-06T23:52:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-06 23:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2ce188cc-8734-5eb6-8e65-b4ff891b62d9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/le4zlk/tsmc_a_newbe_sort_of_dd/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/le4zlk/tsmc_a_newbe_sort_of_dd/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Thorpio","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thorpio","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Thorpio","score":99,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$TSMC-----------------------------新来的DD","the_new_excerpt":"自去年12月以来，全球的微芯片生产量正在减少。\n汽车市场是第一个反映最强烈的行业。\n金融时报》和IHS Markit表示，本田、丰田、FCA、通用汽车和通用汽车的汽车生产。\n福特会放慢脚步，很多钱都会流失。公司，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$TSMC-----------------------------新來的DD","the_new_excerpt":"自去年12月以來，全球的微芯片生產量正在減少。\n汽車市場是第一個反映最強烈的行業。\n金融時報》和IHS Markit表示，本田、豐田、FCA、通用汽車和通用汽車的汽車生產。\n福特會放慢腳步，很多錢都會流失。公司，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-38400086-deb8-55b6-b3d0-abe73ae5aafc","excerpt":"Blackberry Clients and Partners\n\nAutomakers: Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley,\nLamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio,\nBMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon,\nSkoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura,…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/le6xon/bbs_many_clients_and_partners/","title":"BB's Many Clients and Partners","date":"February 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"BB的众多客户和合作伙伴","the_new_excerpt":"黑莓客户端和合作伙伴\n\n汽车制造商。本田、奥迪、吉普、三菱、福特、现代、大众、宾利。\n兰博基尼、拜腾、迷你（cooper）、丰田、斯巴鲁、菲亚特克莱斯勒、马自达、尼奥。\n宝马、保时捷、雷克萨斯、起亚、路虎、奔驰、别克、捷豹、伟世通。\n斯柯达、雪佛兰、日产、讴歌、...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"BB的衆多客戶和合作夥伴","the_new_excerpt":"黑莓客戶端和合作夥伴\n\n汽車製造商。本田、奧迪、吉普、三菱、福特、現代、大衆、賓利。\n蘭博基尼、拜騰、迷你（cooper）、豐田、斯巴魯、菲亞特克萊斯勒、馬自達、尼奧。\n寶馬、保時捷、雷克薩斯、起亞、路虎、奔馳、別克、捷豹、偉世通。\n斯柯達、雪佛蘭、日產、謳歌、...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-d1b7117c-7d7d-5551-a643-14ae142c2895","excerpt":"So as everyone is aware, depression and mental health issues have been on the\nrise massively with lockdown and the virus in general.\n\nA few months ago I made a good investment with a company called Compas pathways,\nwhich are developing anti depressants from psilocybin (magic mushrooms).
