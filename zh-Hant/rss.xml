It usually comes with the title &lt;strong&gt;How to 3x the S&amp;amp;P CAGR with less risk | Leverage for the Long Run&lt;/strong&gt; with people praising it as an amazing new strategy that requires little effort, provides a high degree of safety, and allows you to experience only the good side of leveraged ETFs. Here&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s complete bullshit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen the 200 SMA argument posted hundreds of times before in &lt;a href=&quot;/r/LETFs&quot;&gt;r/LETFs&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m glad this one at least comes with a paper, but the paper is still falling for the same mistakes other believers fall for. The author is correct that volatility increases below any significant moving average (20/50/100/200), however, avoiding volatility should not be your main concern when holding unhedged leveraged ETFs. Your main concern should be flash crashes like in 1987 where the market fell 22% in one day. The author says this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chart 6 shows that historically, the worst 1% of trading days have occurred far more often than not below the Moving Average. Included in this list are the two worst days in market history: October 19th in 1987 and October 28th in 1929&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow look at that, moving averages helped avoid the worst two days... but why? The answer is partially due to the fact that both the best and worst days will be in periods of high volatility, but it&amp;#39;s also heavily influenced by pure chance. A day like Black Monday could happen at anytime and if there wasn&amp;#39;t a choppy market leading up to it you will miss it with moving averages. An unleveraged 22% drop would be a 66% drop for the portfolio suggested in the paper. The market would then likely dip below the 200 SMA and the person would sell! Missing the entire ride back up, even if there was more to fall you&amp;#39;re not going to be left in a good place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no macroeconomic reason that moving averages have any form of predictive power. The closest thing would be the concept of a self fulfilling prophecy which would require a massive audience of believers to have an impact (there are not nearly enough). People always use 200 SMA, but if you try to test other SMAs nearby you sometimes get significantly worse results. The 200 SMA just happens to get you out before the Dot Com crash as well as the GFC. When your entire reasoning is based on &lt;em&gt;well it did good in the past&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;re overfitting by definition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at another strategy that &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; an economic backing - HFEA. Holding stocks and bonds together isn&amp;#39;t something that &lt;em&gt;just happens to work&lt;/em&gt; when you test it. When stocks experience uncertainty large investors move their money into the safety of bonds which forces them in the opposite direction to the stock. Stocks and bonds are slightly, but not perfectly inversely correlated &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; both of them have positive expected returns. This is why they are the ideal hedge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that &lt;strong&gt;this is not an academic paper that came from a university&lt;/strong&gt;. It was published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leadlagreport.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.leadlagreport.com/&lt;/a&gt; which says on its homepage &amp;quot;Consistently win in the stock market and minimize risk regardless of market conditions&amp;quot; followed by a subscribe button. This is called bullshit and I encourage anyone who cares about honesty to call it out when shit like this is posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brand new 3v3 MOBA game where teams take control of various Disney &amp;amp; Pixar characters behind developed by Mighty Bear Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be offered on Apple Arcade and goal is to keep it simple (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techradar.com/features/how-to-make-a-league-of-legends-kids-can-play-according-to-disney-melee-manias-developers&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOBA veterans may be aghast that Disney Melee Mania has no lanes, towers, computer-controlled minions, or even skill progression, but the result is the leanest version of the game type we’ve ever seen – which could be a perfect onramp for brand-new players to learn the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question isn&amp;#39;t so much specific to this game. My main question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think Disney will do a good job of expanding into gaming&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like Disney generally has been perhaps too cautious. Years ago they had chances to deepen their relationship with Riot Games, but they let that slip through their fingers. Now Riot has a hit on Netflix which could&amp;#39;ve been Disney&amp;#39;s. This is a big shame since Riot has an incredible universe of character and worlds that would be as good as a mini Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney has so much great IP if they can crack the gaming code, add that to their ESPN and merchandising expertise it will be huge.&lt;/p&gt;

Just because someone made 1000% gains on something doesn&amp;#39;t mean you are going to make that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, that the faster any asset climbs up the faster it comes down like a house of cards. If it had no resistance going up, there is no support going down and when such stocks crack, they fall through the roof in a matter of hours, not even days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, you get ads on YouTube every 2 seconds with someone shouting in your face with so called their magic formula where their students make $500-$2000 every trade. Don&amp;#39;t fall for these snake oil salesman. If making money were that easy, nobody would work their ass off for years just to buy a house or a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick up a book and learn the basics of Finance. Fundamentals will help you get a handle of how to start valuing a company. While Technical charts play a role in short to medium term movements of the stock, long term is always going to be based on Fundamentals. Watch Peter Lynch&amp;#39;s videos on YouTube, he is an old school investor just like Warren Buffett, but has some really good food for thoughts in his videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, if you are investing in Crpto be extremely conservative. 10% of your portfolio is too much. Anything more than that, and you lose your hard earned savings very quickly if things go south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand there is a Euphoria when you make quick money, but derivatives like Futures and Options are sure shot way of getting screwed if you don&amp;#39;t know what you are doing. Everyone has an itch to make a lot of money in a short period of time, but trust me, losing your original investment is one the worst feeling you can ever have if you earned that money by working hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know anything at all about investing and want to start putting some money into an investment account, buy a broad market based ETF like SPY or QQQ on a regular basis. Think $100-$200-$500/month. Time in the market is always going to beat timing the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, as Warren Buffett said - Rule 1: Never lose money and Rule 2: Never forget Rule 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Don&amp;#39;t invest blindly in Stocks that some friend/stranger recommended you. Efforts to make money quickly on Stocks, Crpto, or Derivatives (Futures and Options) without understanding the fundamentals and risks, will make you lose your hard earned money and your shirt. If you don&amp;#39;t know anything about investing, buy broad market based ETF like SPY and QQQ on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trading mostly even throughout the day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) sold off sharply in the last hour. Early in the morning, President Biden announced this morning that Jerome Powell was renominated to lead the Federal Reserve for another four years. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who was Powell’s main competitor, was nominated as the Vice-Chair. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for more inflation data set to be released later this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, President Biden announced he was nominating Jerome Powell for a second, four-year term as the Chair of the Federal Reserve and Fed Governor Lael Brainard as the Vice-Chair, ending weeks of speculation who would be tapped to run the nation’s Central Bank. Biden was expected to select either Powell or current Fed Governor Lael Brainard as Fed chair. Following the nomination, Powell will go before the Senate Banking Committee for approval, and if confirmed, will serve another four-year term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Browne, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Pimco, said “I think this was largely expected by markets. Certainly there were some conversations in markets over the last couple of weeks about Brainard potentially being elevated to the Fed chair position. But by and large the expectation was for consistency. You may see a little bit of a rally on the back of this with the expectation that policy is going to remain in place and intact, and everything that’s been articulated already by the Fed is likely to continue into 2022 and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, more inflation data is set to be released later this week, which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation and any potential reactions by the Federal Reserve. The Core Personal Consumptions Expenditure (PCE) , which is Fed’s preferred measure for inflation, is set to be released Wednesday and expected to show a 4.1% year-over-year increase. This would be the biggest annual jump in roughly three decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constellation Brands (STZ), the maker of Corona beer, is reportedly exploring for a deal to merge with Monster Beverage, according to a report by Bloomberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private Equity Firm KKR made a $12 billion bid to bring Telecom Italia private, sending shares of the Italian telecommunication company higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales of previously owned homes in the US unexpectedly jumped to their highest level in nine months in October, signaling that housing demand is picking up against a backdrop of low mortgage rates and strengthening labor markets. Existing home sales rose by 0.8% month-over-month in October, reaching an annualized rate of 6.34 million, according to data from the National Association of Realtors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors (GM) bought a 25% stake in electric boat startup Pure Watercraft for $150 million. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix (NFLX) said it is acquiring special effects company Scanline VFX, which is behind the effects of “Stranger Things” and “Game of Thrones”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla Inc is planning to spend more than $1 billion on its new vehicle factory in Austin, Texas, and plans to complete construction by the end of this year, public filings with a Texas state agency showed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA (NVDA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-absurd-beauty-of-hacking-nvidias-gaugan-2-ai-image-machine/&quot;&gt;today detailed an AI system called GauGAN2,&lt;/a&gt; the successor to its GauGAN model, that lets users create lifelike landscape images that don’t exist using text. The program was developed by feeding 10 million high quality images into NVIDIA’s Selene supercomputer. This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist&amp;#39;s vision into a high-quality AI-generated image. The practical benefi is that one can use a few words to get a basic image together without any drawing at all and then tweak details to refine the final output. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other news, NVIDIA is fast tracking development of its “&lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/22/how-nvidia-aims-to-demystify-zero-trust-security/&quot;&gt;Zero-Trust” cybersecurity platform built using their data processing units and Morpheus AI&lt;/a&gt;, citing vulnerabilities in it’s clients&amp;#39; datacenters. Very basically, traditional cybersecurity relies on a perimeter or firewall that prevents viruses and hacks from getting into your computer. Zero-trust is an architecture that also constantly monitors all the data in the system and is able to enforce strict control on what each user can do on the network. Manuvir Das, Head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA said, “You cannot just rely on the firewall on the outside, you have to assume that any application or any user inside your data center is a bad actor,” and “It is not our intention to be a direct provider of cybersecurity solutions. We have built the platform for cybersecurity companies to integrate into their solutions.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ticker ARKG) has seen roughly $520 million of outflows in November amid sinking returns. The fund is down 27% year-to-date as investors shun health-care stocks in favor for more cyclical names that perform well during an economic recovery. Even so, the ETF is faring far worse than the broader biotech sector, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index up 10.49% this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARKG is currently trading at $66.38 a share, lower than its level a year ago, before a steep rally that crested early in 2021. The genomics fund has also seen the largest outflows among Ark’s ETFs this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting that typically loyal Ark investors have been bailing on the ETF,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an advisory firm. “The fund’s assets have been chopped in half since February. While I don’t believe the ETF is experiencing some of sort of ‘doom loop,’ clearly the outflows are putting downward price pressure on the underlying holdings and testing the will of remaining fund owners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ETF’s two top holdings, Teladoc Health Inc. and Exact Sciences Corp., have weighed on its performance, with drops of some 45% and 37% this year, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent outflows may be due to investors looking for shorter-term opportunities into the year-end and freeing up cash, said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ark Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood is well-known for prioritizing longer term investments over short-term gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a 5-10 year hold. AI in health care is going to change the way that we can predict, treat and manage the most difficult diseases like cancer, and the Ark fund gives investors access to the companies who are on the cutting edge of that research,” said Jablonski.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden made the announcement Monday morning following weeks of speculation that a push from progressives might see Fed Governor Lael Brainard get the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainard instead will be vice chair of the board of governors; she had been widely expected to get a separate vice chair for supervision post, which oversees the nation’s banking system. As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,” Biden said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its “decisive” action in the early days of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank’s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,” a White House statement said. “During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated – in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House statement said the recovery is “a testament to the success of the President’s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s economy back on track.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden said that Powell and Brainard “also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political pressure, and a Covid struggle
President Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers “boneheads” for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation’s banking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation’s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Under Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,” Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden’s agenda.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden’s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief’s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed’s chair and is the country’s first female Treasury secretary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,” Yellen said. “I think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed’s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a “dangerous man” and that she would oppose his renomination.&lt;/p&gt;
