It&#39;s an index, not a company.</p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m a very disciplined person and since my first job back when I was 17 y/o i&#39;ve been saving 100% of my income every single month. I&#39;m a software engineer and since i&#39;m still young, i&#39;m still living with my parents and help the household with secondary sources of income such as freelance work and etcetera.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, it&#39;s been over 5 years and I&#39;m still in the red. I always read that time in the market beats timing the markets, the story about the world&#39;s unluckiest investor in the SP500, but for some reason this doesn&#39;t apply to me. Back when I started it was kinda difficult to invest in foreign markets, so most of my portfolio is basically my country&#39;s index, $ECH (Chile IPSA index), which has done nothing but go down in the last 5 years from its $55USD high to the current $33.6 where it&#39;s sitting right now.</p>\n\n<p>A while ago i discovered a fintech that allows us chileans to invest in the US tech sector (a fund composed of ARKK, ARKW, Tesla, Apple and such), and since a lot of people said 2021 was the &quot;year of recovery&quot;, I diversified with that... and 3 days later the treasury-yield crash came and that&#39;s now in the red too. The saddest thing is, not only did I start investing my monthly salary in the tech sector, but also a payment from a freelance job i had been working in since early 2020, so I lost a bunch of money with the recent crash because I didn&#39;t DCA. Now, the reason i didn&#39;t DCA is 1) i believed in analysts saying 2021 was the year of recovery and 2) i had a horrible experience with DCA&#39;ing in ECH, as i &quot;buy the dip&quot; but it keeps getting lower and lower. It doesn&#39;t matter that i bought cheaper the next month: it just keeps going lower and lower.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly don&#39;t know why I have such bad luck. I can&#39;t withdraw my money even if i wanted to because of the losses (I don&#39;t want to do so anyways) and i would&#39;ve been much better just spending everything instead in a car, a house or something.</p>\n\n<p>How can I stop losing all of my income? Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I&#39;m adding some context on the chilean market below. I tried to be as concise as possible, I hope it&#39;s good enough.</p>\n\n<p>I started investing IPSA in late 2017. Back then (early 2017), the index was looking good because of high expectations in the new president (Sebastian Piñera, a right-winging conservative) economic outlook, people thought Chile would skyrocket thanks to his administration.</p>\n\n<p>2018 came and chilean growth was mediocre at best. People started noticing Piñera&#39;s better times (Tiempos Mejores) weren&#39;t a reality, as economy-oriented government reforms were hard to implement because of the left-wing politicans in the chamber of deputies blocking them.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s 2019, the year of the commercial war between the US and China. China was the main economic partner of Chile, so the confrontation was very bad for the chilean economy. Some side effects of the trade war, according to analysts, include lower prices in commodities such as copper. There is a very high, known historical correlation between copper and the Chile IPSA index (you can read about it in <a href=\"https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12580/3612/BCCh-rec-v17n3dic2014p056-085.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">this</a> paper, the point being it&#39;s been studied). So, low copper prices + trade war = $ECH goes down even more.</p>\n\n<p>October 2019 comes and the 30 peso revolution starts. Public protests were an alien thing for us chileans before October 2019, we had a very stable country with low to none social revolts in our recent history. This revolt started because of a subway (Metro) fare price hike 2 days prior. Protesters destroyed the subway, supermarkets, police stations, and so on and so forth, asking for a refundation and a new constitution that replaces the one written by Pinochet&#39;s regime 40 years ago. The IPSA crashes.</p>\n\n<p>Late 2019 comes and politicians from all sectors, left and right, conservatives and liberals, reach an agreement for a new constitution, one to be written by 155 electors chosen by popular vote in the same way as deputies. The IPSA goes up 8% in a single day because everything seems to be going good. The protests mostly stop and Chile finds its new peace. Investors are scared at first because of the potential dangers of a new constituion, but since we have a D&#39;Hondt voting system, right-wing politicans are certain to reach the necessary threshold of representatives to keep the political stability that characterizes Chile as a country, especially when compared to its latin american neighbors. Investors stop fearing so much, and it&#39;s this point when i said to myself &quot;it&#39;s finally going to pay off. 2020 is going to be a great year for my portfolio!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Then 2020 comes and the virus comes. The IPSA crashes to 2008 levels. At this point, it just makes me laugh how unlucky I can be. There is a small-percentage recovery right now from the absolutely low nonsense prices we had in 2020, especially because Chile is the second best country in vaccination speed after Israel, we&#39;re expected to reach herd immunity in June 2021 or earlier. Also copper is at all-time high prices, but we lost the copper-to-IPSA correlation after these recent events.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s where Chile stands at, 2009 levels right now. In order to recover my losses, the IPSA would need to recover from: a commercial war, a social revolt, the dangers of a new constitution, the coronavirus, and the impact of low copper prices from years prior.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mf6a9g/i_save_my_entire_income_and_cant_stop_losing_money/","title":"I save my entire income and can't stop losing money","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-29T06:57:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-29 06:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ab64343f-f989-5f8a-9899-ef00966d2dc9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mf6a9g/i_save_my_entire_income_and_cant_stop_losing_money/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mf6a9g/i_save_my_entire_income_and_cant_stop_losing_money/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"tetraethylammoniumX","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/tetraethylammoniumX","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"tetraethylammoniumX","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我把所有的收入都存起来了，但又不能不赔钱。","the_new_excerpt":"对不起，我的英语，它不是我的第一语言。声明：ECH=IPSA。它是\n一个指数，而不是一家公司。\n\n所以我是一个很有纪律的人，从我17岁时的第一份工作开始，我就开始了。\n我每个月都把收入的100%存起来。我是一个软件工程师\n因为我还年轻，我还... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我把所有的收入都存起來了，但又不能不賠錢。","the_new_excerpt":"對不起，我的英語，它不是我的第一語言。聲明：ECH=IPSA。它是\n一個指數，而不是一家公司。\n\n所以我是一個很有紀律的人，從我17歲時的第一份工作開始，我就開始了。\n我每個月都把收入的100%存起來。我是一個軟件工程師\n因爲我還年輕，我還... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a1382a75-3685-5c17-8f03-e42e543b1a5d","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfdem4/loss_porn_the_meme_stock_effect/","title":"Loss porn: The meme stock effect","date":"March 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"亏损色情。记忆股票效应","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"虧損色情。記憶股票效應","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-4ccbedff-30e1-5911-8e11-cff5ce51508f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfihd1/so_it_begins/","title":"So it begins..","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 29, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"所以它开始了...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"所以它開始了...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ab64343f-f989-5f8a-9899-ef00966d2dc9","previousId":"RedditPost-a1382a75-3685-5c17-8f03-e42e543b1a5d","nextId":"RedditPost-4ccbedff-30e1-5911-8e11-cff5ce51508f","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mf6a9g/i_save_my_entire_income_and_cant_stop_losing_money/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
