Since NOK has recently been tied in with BB, AMC, and GME (BANG), it isn&#39;t surprising that people are expecting great things from this earnings report. After all, Nokia is literally <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/\">going to the moon</a>, right?</p>\n\n<p>But, unlike GME and AMC, Nokia is not in a short squeeze situation. And the NASA moon contract? Worth $14 million. In other words, it&#39;s barely a drop in the bucket for a multi-billion dollar company like Nokia. Plus, it&#39;s old news (Oct 19, 2020). You&#39;re not a genius for knowing about it.</p>\n\n<p>And to make matters worse, Nokia was actually falling behind enough in 5G technology last year to lose a massive, $6.64 BILLION 5G contract with Verizon to Samsung, which, according to <a href=\"https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/samsungs-massive-verizon-5g-contract-spells-doom-for-nokia/2020/09/\">this guy</a>, spells doom for the company. (Again, old news.)</p>\n\n<p>So, why are people so high on Nokia? According to some, they&#39;re not, and it&#39;s just part of a hedge fund bot conspiracy to distract from GME. You&#39;re welcome to believe that, since, undoubtedly, hedge fund bots pulled some shady shit on here last week.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/nok/blackrock\">Blackrock</a> will probably thank you for the discount and just buy more. Why? Because Nokia is doing everything a company in their position should be doing. Last year, they brought on a new CEO, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-ceo/nokia-replaces-ceo-with-fortum-boss-lundmark-to-revive-5g-business-idUSKBN20P0PB\">Pekka Lundmark</a>, who held executive positions at Nokia between 1990 and 2000, including <strong>vice president of strategy and business development</strong> at Nokia Networks in the years leading up to their global dominance in the cell phone industry, when their share price topped <strong>$55.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And he has already shown that he isn&#39;t interested in trying to hide the company&#39;s current flaws. In his Q3 Earnings report, which you can read <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/30/nokia-nok-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/\">here</a> in full, he pushes aggressively for an honest and transparent assessment of the company&#39;s current strengths and weaknesses. He acknowledges that Nokia&#39;s 5G was, on average, behind its competitors at the time of his arrival, and he has already taken steps to change this.</p>\n\n<p>These steps include giving each segment of the company more freedom and direct ownership of their segment, which he insists much justify their profit and loss results independently of the others. In other words, they are going to cut the fat and stop half-assing things, no longer allowing their most profitable segments to be dragged down by the rest. Moreover, they are giving their various segments more freedom to adjust to the needs of their customers, and he admits that they are going to have to spend more on R&amp;D in the short-term in order to catch up in the areas where they feel that they can be the global leaders.</p>\n\n<p>This turnaround comes at a convenient time with many major governments essentially <a href=\"https://tech.newstatesman.com/security/where-every-country-stands-huawei\">banning the global leader in 5G, Huawei</a>, which will undoubtedly open up an array of opportunities for the company. And this past month, the first in which Nokia&#39;s new corporate structure has really begun to take shape, has already seen them begin to capitalize on these opportunities. In mid-January, for example, they announced <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/nokia-supports-t-mobile-5g-evolution-with-five-year-expansion-deal/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic\">a multi-billion dollar extension</a> of their longstanding partnership with T-Mobile to expand its 5G network and a global partnership with <a href=\"https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/14/google-cloud-nokia-partner-to-accelerate-cloud-native-5g-readiness-for-communication-service-providers/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic\">Google Cloud</a> to jointly develop could-native 5G core solutions for communication service providers and enterprise customers.</p>\n\n<p>In short, they are trimming the fat, getting their shit together, and focusing on the future: being the foundation upon which the technology of the future is based--everything from industrial automation to automotive to IoT.</p>\n\n<p>That said, Pekka himself acknowledged that these things are going to take time. Hear it in his own words from the Q3 earnings report:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I want to be very clear that I believe the potential of Nokia is substantial, but delivering on that promise will not happen overnight. We expect to stabilize our financial performance in 2021 and deliver progressive improvement toward our long-term goals after that.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, those hoping to see the benefits of lucrative 5G contracts or moon contracts this Thursday are going to be disappointed. What we should expect to see, if we are correct in our bullish expectations for Nokia, is the beginning of stability and profitability for a company that is just starting another long-term ramp up. This will reinforce the thesis that they are on pace for the long-term growth that could ultimately see them as a global leader again.</p>\n\n<p>That said, although the outlook is long-term, realize that the market is also forward looking. Nokia will not have to have insane earnings for its stock value to boom; it will simply have to reassure investors that it can achieve the vision it has set out for itself. And under new management, that seems likely to me. It seems to me that major investors like Blackrock are aware of this likelihood, and that this explains their willingness to get in now before takeoff occurs.</p>\n\n<p>So, while Nokia is a very different play from AMC and GME in that its thesis is forward-looking like that of BB rather than relying on a short squeeze, realize that the market itself is forward-looking, and that another potential decade-long era of growth for this company is already upon us. If they continue to reassure investors of this, there is every reason for it to continue to be named in the same breath as the other BANG stocks.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-2020 NOK 👎</li>\n<li>2020 NOK 🤷‍♂ 💡! 🏋️‍♂️</li>\n<li>2021+ NOK 💪? 🚀🚀🚀 🌚</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I&#39;m not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice.
