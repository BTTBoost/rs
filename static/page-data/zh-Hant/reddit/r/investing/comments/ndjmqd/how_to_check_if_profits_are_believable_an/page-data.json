If the company spent it on salaries, raw materials, machinery, or paying interest or tax, it is counted as a cost.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) The earnings figure, which also measures the amount of money left after costs.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Is calculated using accounting rules to recognize revenue and costs in the same time period to produce a more accurate statement of a company’s financial performance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4) Huh? So what&#39;s the difference?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The matching rules mean accountants use their judgment, to spread the cost / revenue over when they occur.  For example -</p>\n\n<p>-Deprecate assets over time</p>\n\n<p>-Write of assets to loss on the P/L</p>\n\n<p>-Book revenue, when a company issues an invoice</p>\n\n<p><strong>5) What does this means?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, the above transactions can take place without any cash changing hands.</p>\n\n<p>-The company can issue an invoice, record revenue, and yet the customer has not paid.</p>\n\n<p>-Writing of an asset moves the value of the asset to the P/L but no cash in the bank.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6) Its the accountant&#39;s judgement!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The size of these adjustments depend on judgments made by a company’s finance department, how long a piece of equipment will last, for example, or when to book revenue</p>\n\n<p><strong>7) It is reasonable to assume some will make judgements that flatter profit.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Without these judgments though, revenue and profit, would come in great chunks.   Some years a company might look extraordinarily profitable, years in which it did not invest for example.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8) How to sense check profits?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check Exceptional items first.   Before we compare cash flows to profit, we can check whether the company is inflating the reported profit figure by ignoring exceptional items</p>\n\n<p><strong>9) Exceptional items  Also known as</strong></p>\n\n<p>-One-off</p>\n\n<p>-Non-recurring costs</p>\n\n<p>If a large proportion of the adjusted profit is the result of adjustments or the company routinely makes adjustments, it is sensible to question whether the costs are truly exceptional.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10) Major tip - Follow the cashflow!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The cash flow statement starts with reported profit, adds back non-cash charges and gains created by accounting judgments to arrive at operating cash flow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11) Even better</strong></p>\n\n<p>By focusing your attentions on free cash flow it is possible to get closer to the truth about a company’s financial performance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12) What is free cash flow?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In layman’s terms it is the amount of cash that a company has left over every year to pay its lenders and shareholders. It is essentially a company’s cash profits.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly it is after taking into account expenses on capital. Therefore free cashflow is the cash the company generates which could be removed from the businesses without slowing down its growth!</p>\n\n<p><strong>13) And importantly it is the company&#39;s profits free from accounting judgement.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>14) The best ratios to check for high free cashflow?</strong></p>\n\n<p>-CROCI (Higher the better)</p>\n\n<p>In essence, CROCI measures the cash profits of a company as a proportion of the funding required to generate them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>15) If you scan the market for high CROCI companies its a great place to start a search for investable companies.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this then maybe I can tempt you with my Twitter page <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_JosephWilks\">/_JosephWilks</a> where I write daily insights on long-term investing like this. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/ndjmqd/how_to_check_if_profits_are_believable_an/","title":"How to check if profits are believable, an accountants view.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-16T11:02:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-16 11:02","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"554c027e-5746-576a-8f22-086578edc260","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ndjmqd/how_to_check_if_profits_are_believable_an/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ndjmqd/how_to_check_if_profits_are_believable_an/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"JosephWilks","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JosephWilks","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"JosephWilks","score":529,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"会計士の視点から見た、利益の信憑性を確認する方法。","the_new_excerpt":"利益よりもキャッシュフローに注目して、利益が信じられるかどうかをチェックする。\n\nEarnings & Free Cash Flow、その関係を見てみよう。\n\nスレッド(1/15)\n\n1)EarningsとFree Cash Flowは同じものを表す2つの指標です。\n\n会社が営業活動からどれだけのお金を稼いだかを差し引いた後の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"如何检查利润是否可信，一个会计师的观点。","the_new_excerpt":"关注现金流而不是利润，以检查利润是否可信。\n\n收益和自由现金流，让我们看看它们之间的关系。\n\n主题(1/15)\n\n1）收益和自由现金流是同一事物的两个衡量标准。\n\n公司从经营活动中赚了多少钱，在扣除了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何檢查利潤是否可信，一個會計師的觀點。","the_new_excerpt":"關注現金流而不是利潤，以檢查利潤是否可信。\n\n收益和自由現金流，讓我們看看它們之間的關係。\n\n主題(1/15)\n\n1）收益和自由現金流是同一事物的兩個衡量標準。\n\n公司從經營活動中賺了多少錢，在扣除了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-810cc6cb-c523-54bc-9299-9c6699bb1212","excerpt":"I’m currently 24 and in a no income tax state.
