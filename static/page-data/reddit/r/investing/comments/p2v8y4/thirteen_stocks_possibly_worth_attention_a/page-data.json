TheStreet score</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.</p>\n\n<p>From thestreet.com:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>A (Excellent)</em></strong> <em>–  The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance  while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of  total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most  of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns  compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication —  not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to  deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.</em></p>\n\n<p>And about the methodology:</p>\n\n<p><em>TheStreet  Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a  12-month period including both price appreciation and</em> <strong><em>dividends</em></strong>*.  Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to  perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest  rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* <strong><em>subjective</em></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><em>objective</em></strong> <em>elements.  For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market  returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted  company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past  operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Zacks Rank</strong></p>\n\n<p>It  is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re  avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks  Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Weiss Ratings recommendation</strong></p>\n\n<p>We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:</p>\n\n<p><em>“A” Rating:</em> <strong><em>Excellent.</em></strong> <em>The  company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong  performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price  that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion  is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior  performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best  stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be  considered the equivalent of a “</em><strong><em>Strong Buy</em></strong><em>“.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>“B” rating:</em> <strong><em>Good.</em></strong> <em>The  company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of  performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock  is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value,  with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good  investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered  the equivalent of a “</em><strong><em>Buy</em></strong><em>“.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price</strong></p>\n\n<p>Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the MarketBeat stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Piotroski F-Score</strong></p>\n\n<p>The  Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria  used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation,  including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the  worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in Piotroski&#39;s paper from 2000:</p>\n\n<p><em>In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a</em> <strong><em>23% annual return</em></strong> <em>between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.</em></p>\n\n<p>It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Moody’s Daily Credit Risk</strong></p>\n\n<p>Moody’s  Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a  forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily  and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a  company’s liabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The value is retrieved from Business Insider&#39;s website and is expected to be in the range of 1-6.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score</strong></p>\n\n<p>The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both <strong>technical</strong> analysis and <strong>fundamental</strong>  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50. From their website:</p>\n\n<p><em>The  Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long  Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall  score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your  investing style.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A  low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just  that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.</em></p>\n\n<p>Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview website (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.</p>\n\n<p>I  hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock  selection and the strategy?
