I&#39;m employed at ~$90k/yr, wife is not atm but brings home ~1400/mo tax free VA disability. No debt, currently renting.</p>\n\n<p>I currently have about $125k in a target fund 401k to which I contribute 20%, including a 6% company match. I also have a Fidelity account with about $35k in a rollover IRA(randomly chose FSCSX first, then moved about 85% to VOO), $8k in a former employer 401a and then recently opened an individual account to start trying to save more, smarter. I&#39;ll have to look at the wife&#39;s, she only has a small 403b and an old mutual fund with $30-40k that&#39;s probably being eaten up with fees. $20k in emergency savings. </p>\n\n<p>My main question first, is if I should be doing something better with ~$90k in the short-term instead of a MMSA at 0.45%?  This is equity money we are saving for a down-payment but given the market and potential life changes, I think we&#39;re gonna wait at least another year maybe more before we buy again. It&#39;s been sitting there for a year and a half and I feel like I should be getting something more than the $33/mo returns. 😥 But I understand a high risk approach is not suitable here. I could see it being 2 maybe 3 years now before we make any big decisions and may need it.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ve also been contributing $1k per month to the down payment fund which can continue or be modified to go elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m ignorant on pretty much all of this, but interested to start getting things on better track in order to better prepare for our future. Any advice on what to do with that cash for now while I educate myself on the rest of my mess? Thanks guys and gals.</p>\n\n<p>Mike\nColorado, USA</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ntljze/newbie_what_do_i_do_with_90k/","title":"Newbie, what do I do with $90k??","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"June 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-06T17:55:52.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-06 17:55","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"46db3629-732b-51b4-a25d-dd3977302b5a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ntljze/newbie_what_do_i_do_with_90k/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ntljze/newbie_what_do_i_do_with_90k/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"madmike283","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/madmike283","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"madmike283","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"初心者の方、9万円で何をすればいいですか？","the_new_excerpt":"おはようございます。\n\n新しい投稿者です。43歳、既婚、子供なし、経験はほとんどありません。\nどのようにして自分の行動をきれいにしていくべきか悩んでいます。私は年収約9万ドルで雇用されていますが、妻は今のところいません。\n年収約9万ドルで雇用されています。借金はなく、現在は賃貸しています。\n\n私は現在、約$125kを...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"新手，我用9万美元做什么？","the_new_excerpt":"早上好，\"头\"。\n\n我是新来的，43岁，已婚，没有孩子，几乎没有经验，想知道我应该如何开始清理我的行为。\n我应该如何开始清理我的行为。我有工作，年薪约9万美元，妻子目前没有工作。\n但每月能带回家~1400美元的免税VA残疾。没有债务，目前在租房。\n\n我目前有大约12.5万美元的存款。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新手，我用9萬美元做什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"早上好，\"頭\"。\n\n我是新來的，43歲，已婚，沒有孩子，幾乎沒有經驗，想知道我應該如何開始清理我的行爲。\n我應該如何開始清理我的行爲。我有工作，年薪約9萬美元，妻子目前沒有工作。\n但每月能帶回家~1400美元的免稅VA殘疾。沒有債務，目前在租房。\n\n我目前有大約12.5萬美元的存款。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3ced3abe-4a08-5720-974d-b8aeb3bbb351","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntgqla/first_time_buyer_of_bb/","title":"First time Buyer of BB 🚀","date":"June 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"BBの初回購入者 🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"第一次购买BB的人 🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"第一次購買BB的人 🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-9ff31909-5656-585a-a34c-2d3e47ef0443","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntn39p/the_monkey_fool_a_parody_on_how_bullsht_fud/","title":"❗“The Monkey Fool”❗ 🤡: A Parody on How Bullsh!t FUD Campaigns Are Made for GameStop 😹 A Professional GME Meme All By Me For You This Sunday ❤️","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 06, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"The Monkey Fool」❗ 🤡。A Parody on How Bullsh!t FUD Campaigns Are Made for GameStop 😹 A Professional GME Meme All By Me For You This Sunday ❤️」です。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"❗ \"The Monkey Fool\"❗ 🤡: A Parody on How Bullsh!t FUD Campaigns Are Made for GameStop 😹 A Professional GME Meme All By Me For You This Sunday ❤️","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"❗ \"The Monkey Fool\"❗ 🤡: A Parody on How Bullsh!t FUD Campaigns Are Made for GameStop 😹 A Professional GME Meme All By Me For You This Sunday ❤️","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-46db3629-732b-51b4-a25d-dd3977302b5a","previousId":"RedditPost-3ced3abe-4a08-5720-974d-b8aeb3bbb351","nextId":"RedditPost-9ff31909-5656-585a-a34c-2d3e47ef0443","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ntljze/newbie_what_do_i_do_with_90k/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
