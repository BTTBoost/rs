Shares of the company tumbled 18% in extended trading.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:</p>\n\n<p>Loss per share: 87 cents vs. 39 cents expected</p>\n\n<p>Revenue: $106.4 million vs. $109.2 million expected</p>\n\n<p>Beyond reported fiscal third-quarter net loss of $54.8 million, or 87 cents per share, wider than a net loss of $19.3 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected a loss of 39 cents per share.</p>\n\n<p>The company said it faced higher transportation and warehousing costs and increased its inventory write-offs, which hurt its profits. About $9 million was written off due to water damage at one of its plants, which mostly affected packaging.</p>\n\n<p>Net sales rose 12.7% to $106.4 million, missing expectations of $109.2 million. Compared with the second quarter, its revenue fell, bucking typical seasonal trends for the company’s products. Customers usually buy more Beyond Burgers during the summer to grill.</p>\n\n<p>The company reported strong growth outside the United States, with international grocery and restaurant divisions each seeing sales more than double during the quarter.</p>\n\n<p>However, U.S. revenue fell 13.9% compared with a year ago, mostly due to weaker grocery demand. CEO Ethan Brown told analysts that grocery sales didn’t help make up for shrinking food service orders, unlike in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The company also said softer demand and operational challenges, like severe weather, hurt its domestic sales. Brown said new competitors in the market are putting pressure on its market share, but data doesn’t reveal that the lower demand is due to other companies stealing its customers. New products, like its meatless chicken, slightly offset U.S. sales declines.</p>\n\n<p>In October, the company warned investors that it would be reporting weaker sales than it had previously predicted, citing a wide range of factors, including the delta variant and distribution problems.</p>\n\n<p>And the company’s forecast doesn’t indicate a sunnier fourth quarter. Beyond is predicting net sales of $85 million to $110 million for those three months. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $131.6 million during the quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond said it’s expecting some of the operational challenges from the third quarter to drag down its fourth-quarter results as well. It also cited restaurants’ labor challenges and hesitant ordering behavior due to uncertainty tied to the pandemic as other factors embedded in the outlook. The company noted that the period contains 5 fewer shipping days than a year prior.</p>\n\n<p>“Near-term market and operating conditions notwithstanding, we remain committed to our long-term strategy,” Brown said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>He told analysts he is feeling optimistic about 2022. He hinted at new product launches coming next year, saying that some of those items could reach price parity with meat.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/beyond-meat-bynd-q3-2021-earnings.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/beyond-meat-bynd-q3-2021-earnings.html</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qrba22/beyond_meat_shares_crater_as_losses_mount_company/","title":"Beyond Meat shares crater as losses mount, company expects weak U.S. sales growth ahead","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T05:29:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 05:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qrba22","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qrba22/beyond_meat_shares_crater_as_losses_mount_company/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qrba22/beyond_meat_shares_crater_as_losses_mount_company/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rockinoutwith2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rockinoutwith2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rockinoutwith2","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ビヨンド・ミート社の株価は損失が拡大し、米国での販売が伸び悩むことが予想される","the_new_excerpt":"水曜日に発表されたBeyond Meat社の第3四半期の業績は、米国での代替肉の需要が減少したことにより、損失が拡大しました。\n第3四半期は、米国における代替肉の需要が減少したことに加え、コストの上昇が利益を圧迫したため、損失が拡大しました。\n\nまた、第4四半期の見通しについても、投資家を失望させる結果となりました。\n....","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Beyond Meat股价因亏损而崩溃，公司预计未来美国销售增长乏力","the_new_excerpt":"Beyond Meat公司周三报告说，由于美国对其肉类替代品的需求萎缩，其第三季度的亏损有所扩大。\n由于美国对其肉类替代品的需求萎缩，以及成本上升侵蚀了其利润。\n\n该公司的第四季度展望也令投资者失望。\n该公司表示，预计销售不会立即恢复，....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Beyond Meat股價因虧損而崩潰，公司預計未來美國銷售增長乏力","the_new_excerpt":"Beyond Meat公司週三報告說，由於美國對其肉類替代品的需求萎縮，其第三季度的虧損有所擴大。\n由於美國對其肉類替代品的需求萎縮，以及成本上升侵蝕了其利潤。\n\n該公司的第四季度展望也令投資者失望。\n該公司表示，預計銷售不會立即恢復，....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qqrg59","excerpt":"These daily discussions run from Monday to Friday including during our themed\nposts.\n\nSome helpful links:\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy] for charts, fundamentals, and\n   aggregated news on individual stocks\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n *…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qqrg59/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_nov_10_2021/","title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Nov 10, 2021","date":"November 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Nov 10, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"毎日のディスカッションは、月曜から金曜まで、テーマごとに行われます。\nが行われます。\n\n参考になるリンクをご紹介します。\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy] チャート、ファンダメンタルズ、個別銘柄の集約されたニュースのための\n   個別銘柄のニュースを集約したもの\n * Bloomberg market news [https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n *...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Nov 10, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"这些日常讨论从周一到周五进行，包括在我们的主题性\n帖子。\n\n一些有用的链接。\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy] 提供图表、基本面和个人新闻的汇总。\n   个别股票的汇总新闻\n * 彭博市场新闻[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n *...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Wednesday - Nov 10, 2021","the_new_excerpt":"這些日常討論從週一到週五進行，包括在我們的主題性\n帖子。\n\n一些有用的鏈接。\n\n * Finviz [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy] 提供圖表、基本面和個人新聞的彙總。\n   個別股票的彙總新聞\n * 彭博市場新聞[https://www.bloomberg.com/markets]\n *...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1458671734215827459","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1458671734215827459","title":"RT @zerohedge: MUSK SOLD ADDITIONAL 3.59M TESLA SHARES WORTH ABOUT $4 BILLION","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 11, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: MUSKが追加で359万株のTESLA株を売却、約40億ドルに相当","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"マスク氏がテスラ株359万株（約40億ドル相当）を追加売却"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: MUSK出售了额外的359万股特斯拉股票，价值约40亿美元。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"马斯克追加出售359万股特斯拉股票，价值约40亿美元"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @zerohedge: MUSK出售了額外的359萬股特斯拉股票，價值約40億美元。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"馬斯克追加出售359萬股特斯拉股票，價值約40億美元"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qrba22","previousId":"RedditPost-qqrg59","nextId":"TweetPost-1458671734215827459","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qrba22/beyond_meat_shares_crater_as_losses_mount_company/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
