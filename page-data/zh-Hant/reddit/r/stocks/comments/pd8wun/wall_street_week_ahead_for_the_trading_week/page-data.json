I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021.</p>\n\n<h1><strong>A key jobs report in the week ahead could drive the next big market move - <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/a-key-jobs-report-in-the-week-ahead-could-drive-the-next-big-market-move.html\">(Source)</a></strong></h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>With Jackson Hole in the rear-view mirror, August’s employment report could be the next driver for markets.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Stocks gained in the past week, surging again to new highs Friday after a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The chairman acknowledged that Fed officials expect to taper back their $120 billion a month bond-buying program this year, a first step toward reversing easy policy.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Powell was speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole, Wyo. symposium, held virtually this year. He said the Fed has seen sufficient progress on inflation, but the labor market has not yet improved enough to start the taper. Importantly, he also emphasized that the wind down of the bond program does not mean the Fed will automatically move on to raise interest rate hikes.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“Powell has made it clear the Fed is not prepared to raise interest rates anytime soon. The market seems relieved by that. … With some of the economic data already slowing, I think interest rate hikes are far, far away, and investors are happy about that,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the US SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Arone said the Fed has so far avoided a “taper tantrum,” similar to the 2013 market sell-off when the Fed announced it was rolling back quantitative easing. Powell’s speech was widely anticipated to clarify the Fed’s position on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, after a number of Fed officials called for the start of a wind down.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Jobs are the focal point</h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Now, market focus shifts even more fiercely to jobs data, with the release Friday of the August employment report.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“For sure, the market is going to react,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think it’s important. I think the issue that they’re going to have is unemployment benefits don’t really run out until the beginning of September. It’s really not until you get the October jobs number that you get a more free look at September.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The dollar index sank after Powell’s Friday morning speech, as stocks rallied to new highs and Treasury yields fell. Other data in the coming week includes consumer confidence Tuesday and Wednesday’s release of Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data and ADP’s private sector payroll data, a kind of preview for Friday’s government jobs report.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised to see follow-through Monday and Tuesday, but ahead of ADP on Wednesday, I’d look for position adjusting which means weaker stocks and weaker bonds and stronger dollar ahead of the jobs data,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>He said Powell was dovish, as expected, while still emphasizing that tapering was coming. But the key for markets was that he stressed the end of the program does not mean “tightening” or rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield had risen above 1.35% this week, but fell to 1.3% after Powell spoke Friday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>U.S. 10-year Treasury yield</h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“The market will get cautious again ahead of the jobs data. Then it’s a new world into September. You have to wait until after the jobs data to see if these moves have sustaining power. This is ‘a buy the rumor, sell the fact’ move,” Chandler said.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Some market pros had expected an announcement on tapering from the Fed at its September meeting, but that view has now mostly changed to a November or December announcement. “Because of the uncertainty of delta, I think it will take more than the next jobs report,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The disruption to jobs in particular is if schools have to close again.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 750,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%. In July, the economy created 943,000 jobs and unemployment slid to 5.4%. Education was a big contributor in July, with 261,000 jobs added in public schools and private education.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“It doesn’t have to be a spectacular number to satisfy their needs,” said Swonk of the August report. “You need a solid jobs number, something north of a half million... I think we’re going to be close to that. They’re going to want to see September employment as well.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Market risks</h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>State Street’s Arone said the Fed’s discussion of the tapering will be top of mind in the markets, just as the next earnings season rolls around.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“It will be interesting at a time when the Fed starts taking its foot off the pedal,” he said. “Right now, the bull case continues to be reasonably strong, but markets don’t go straight up. If I was going to key on a specific risk, I’d keep an eye on third quarter earnings reports, and more importantly what corporate executives are saying about next year.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Arone said strong earnings has been the biggest driver of market gains, helping investors ignore worries about the spread of the Covid delta variant, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and dysfunction in Washington.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The market’s summer rally continued in the past week, with the Dow ending at 35,455, up just about 1% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both ended the week at record highs.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.5% at 4,509, and the Nasdaq rose 2.8% to 15,129.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“The market has been able to ignore all this noise and rally,” he said, adding it would be ironic if it were earnings that caused a sell-off and not a Fed policy change or something else.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>He said the market could get choppy in September and into October, a seasonally weak time of year for stocks.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>“We caught a glimpse of this this quarter, with big tech — where the numbers were beating, but they suggested that future quarters would see slower growth,” Arone said. “Investors didn’t like that, and I think it gave us a glimpse of what happens if it spreads beyond the technology sector to other sectors.”</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>There are a few earnings in the coming week, including Zoom Video Monday, Campbell Soup Wednesday, and Hewlett Packard and Broadcom Thursday.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h1>Watching Ida</h1>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The oil and gas industry is closely watching Hurricane Ida, which was heading straight for Louisiana. Oil, gasoline and natural gas all rallied Friday, as energy companies shut down Gulf of Mexico production ahead of the storm. Louisiana is also home to a number of refineries.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>West Texas Intermediate futures settled up nearly 2% Friday, at $68.74 per barrel. The benchmark U.S. crude was up more than 10% for the week, its best weekly gain since June 5, 2020.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1><strong>This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/didTIRh.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ix151Zj.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices for this past week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/QVpHWsA.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Futures Markets as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/KT1s80n.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/E2AuWSX.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/7RNC2XB.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/puSwYZx.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JHQ3zsL.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday&#39;s close:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wAgKTB0.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gzL4Eck.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Here are the upcoming IPO&#39;s for this week:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/wLwUeqE.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h1><strong>Friday&#39;s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:</strong></h1>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Pgih5dk.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/1qQ8hq7.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/gzDuu8v.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Small Cap Labor Day Rally Getting Underway</h1>\n\n<p>In the below chart, daily data since July 1, 1979 through August 20, 2021 for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/ee23ad03da0bcf4a9f8869976521a446/51d39e9e109dc4da-47/s500x750/7dc9cb9b15e57125a71f2475fad23ab6ccd1423e.jpg\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of today’s close, Russell 2000 is up 13.4% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 19.0% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Small-Caps Bounce</h1>\n\n<p>ln today&#39;s Morning Lineup, we noted the inverse correlation between performance this week and market caps. As shown in the major US Indices screen of our Trend Analyzer tool, the two best performers over the past five days have been Micro-Caps (IWC) followed by small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and the Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR). Mid-cap ETFs are the next best performers with high 2% gains then most large cap indices have only risen around 1.5% this week with the exception of the Dow (DIA) which has not even gained 1%. As for where these indices are trading relative to each one&#39;s trading range, it is partially a mean reversion story. Small caps were deeply oversold one week ago and are now sitting just below their 50-DMAs. While not to as extreme of a degree, mid-caps were similarly trading a full standard deviation below their 50-DMAs last week. Today, they are on the opposite side of their 50-DMAs and on the verge of overbought readings.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/indices0827.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>As previously mentioned, small caps like the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) were oversold last week. From a charting perspective, each of these indices&#39; rallies this week are not only bounces from extreme oversold levels, but they also follow brief dips below their 200-DMAs. But whereas the past five days have seen solid gains, yesterday saw IWC and IWM reject their 50-DMAs and the high end of their ranges that have been in place since late July. In other words, even though small caps have led the market this week, they are not out of the woods yet.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWC.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWM.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Looking at the relative strength lines of small caps like IWC and IWM versus the large cap S&amp;P 500 (SPY) over the past year, the past week&#39;s outperformance again is a blip on the radar and has only put a small dent in the longer term trend of underperformance.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-Small-v-Large2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Where that is not necessarily the case is small market caps versus the smallest market caps. As shown below, the relative strength line of the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) versus the Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out of the past few months&#39; downtrend over the past few days.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082721-IWC-vs-IWM2.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>6 Charts on Stocks Making New All-Time Highs</h1>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 Index made yet another new all-time high yesterday, the 50th on the year. “The all-time record for any one year is 77 S&amp;P 500 new all-time highs back in 1995,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, 2021 is currently on pace for 78 new highs. There’s a long way to go, but this has been an amazing year and this is yet another way to show it.”</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-1.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>As impressive as 50 new highs is, investors need to remember that new highs happen in clusters that can last decades. We’ve been sharing this chart for years, saying exactly that: previous periods of new highs lasted much longer than most expected. Mark Twain said history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. If history rhymes once again, we could still have several more years of new highs.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-2.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Another interesting stat about S&amp;P 500 all-time highs is every month so far in 2021 has seen a new high, 8 for 8. Only once have all 12 months made a new all-time high and that was in 2014. This is somewhat surprising, given the S&amp;P 500 gained only 11.4% in 2014, but it was a very slow and persistent move. Most investors (including this author) would guess it was 1995, but that spectacular year saw new highs in ‘only’ 10 months.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-3.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Although August tends to be historically weak for stocks, that hasn’t been the case this year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has made an incredible 9 new highs already this month, the most since 1929. No, we don’t think this is another 1929, but this is just another way to show how astounding this bull run has been.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-4.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 50 new S&amp;P 500 all-time highs before the end of August is quite a feat. In fact, only twice has the 50 level been cracked through the end of August, in 1964 and 1995.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-5.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>So what happens next? The rest of the year in 1964 the S&amp;P 500 added 3.6%, while it added 9.6% in 1995. Below we looked at all the years with at least 30 new all-time highs through August and sure enough, better than average returns the rest of the year are common. The final 4 months gained 4.7%, versus the average final 4 months gain for all years of 3.6%. Now this is skewed due to 1987s crash, as that was the only time stocks were lower the final 4 months after more than 30 new highs by the end of August. Smoothing things out, the median return jumps up to a very impressive 5.4%, versus a median return of 3.6% for all years.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blog-8.25.21-6.png?ssl=1\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>2021 is off to a roaring start and we continue to expect higher prices before all is said and done. The studies we did today do little to change our view. We’d use any potential weakness as an opportunity to add before potential higher prices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Nasdaq Crosses Another 1,000 Point Threshold</h1>\n\n<p>It won&#39;t be official until the close, but with the Nasdaq crossing 15,000 for the first time today, it&#39;s on pace to cross its third 1,000 point threshold this year and the sixth since the pandemic began in early 2020. The table below lists each 1,000 point threshold that the Nasdaq has crossed over time along with the first day that it crossed that threshold, the number of days since the prior cross, what percentage that 1,000 point consists of relative to the prior threshold, and then how many upside and downside crosses the Nasdaq has had around that level on a closing basis.</p>\n\n<p>Of all the 1,000 point thresholds the Nasdaq has crossed over time, the only one that it never traded back below after crossing it was 6,000 back in April 2017. Besides 1,000, that was also the 1,000 point threshold that took the longest to cross above. After first crossing 5,000 back in March 2000, it took 6,256 days for the Nasdaq to top 6,000. Since then, though, the Nasdaq has been making quick work of 1,000 point thresholds. With the exception of the 486-day gap between 8K and 9K, every other 1,000-point threshold since 6,000 has taken less than a year to cross. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, it took the Nasdaq less than six months to get from 9,000 to 10,000.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-Crosses.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>The long-term chart of the Nasdaq below includes red dots to show each time the Nasdaq first crossed a 1,000 point threshold along with the number of days for each one.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-1000-Point-thresholds.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Looking at the chart above may give you a feeling of lightheadedness given the seemingly parabolic nature of the last few years. An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that as a percentage of the index&#39;s price level, every 1,000 point threshold represents a smaller move in percentage terms. While the move from 9K to 10K represented a move of over 11%, the move from 14K to 15K represents only a little more than 7%. Looking at this chart on a log scale where each label on the y-axis represents a doubling of the index shows how modest the recent 1,000 point thresholds have been relative to earlier ones. Think about it this way, in the less than two years between when the Nasdaq first crossed 2K to when it crossed 5K for the first time (four different 1,000 point thresholds), it rallied 150%. Over the last four years, though, the Nasdaq has crossed 10 different 1,000-point thresholds, but the gain has also only been 150%.</p>\n\n<h6><strong>(<a href=\"https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/08/082421-Nasdaq-1000-Point-thresholds-Log-Scale.png\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!</a>)</strong></h6>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Bulls Head In Separate Directions</h1>\n\n<p>As the major indices have set more record highs in the past week, bullish sentiment has rebounded. The American Association of Individual Investors&#39; (AAII) weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose 6.4 percentage points to 39.4% this week. That is the highest reading of optimism since the week of July 8th when bullish sentiment was a hair above 40%. While recovered, that reading is still muted versus the past year&#39;s range and is only 1.5 percentage points above their historical average.
