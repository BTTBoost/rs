It hasn&#39;t been as great at predicting recessions as some other analysis methods, but, two key points that stand out on the historical chart did precede crashes.  We exceeded one of those levels and are approaching the other. The last time the Schiller ratio was near 40 was right before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000.  Prior to that, the last time it spiked to these levels it preceded the great depression (CAPE = 32) in 1929. The economist who developed this ratio was given the Nobel prize for using this ratio to predict the dot com bubble, so this measurement does carry some weight.<br/>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://data.nasdaq.com/data/MULTPL/SHILLER_PE_RATIO_MONTH-shiller-pe-ratio-by-month\">https://data.nasdaq.com/data/MULTPL/SHILLER_PE_RATIO_MONTH-shiller-pe-ratio-by-month</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Rumors are surfacing that Evergrande has defaulted on one of it&#39;s payments.  This is hearsay at this point, but it seems very suspicious that some banks and bond holders are not commenting on if they are receiving payment from Evergrande.  It also stands to reason, the company is fighting to keep their heads above water to make these payments but they are over $300b in debt.  In reality they are just kicking the can down the road.  It&#39;s a house of cards at this point and the bottom is being pulled out, it&#39;s only a matter of time.\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-await-evergrandes-overdue-148-mln-payment-amid-contagion-fears-2021-11-09/\">https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-await-evergrandes-overdue-148-mln-payment-amid-contagion-fears-2021-11-09/</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Treasury yield curves are flattening.  This is a potentially huge indicator of the uncertainty within the market.  It has reliably predicted the last 7 recessions up to and within 18 months of an inverted yield curve.  The curve is not currently inverted but is starting to flatten. \n\n<ul>\n<li><em>&quot;Strategists are watching the move in the Treasury curve which is showing a narrowing between long end yields, like the 30-year and the shorter end, like the 5-year.</em></li>\n<li><em>“The flattening of the curve reflects more hawkish fed assumptions, also reflected in the fed funds futures market,” said Jeffery. He said the spread between the 5-year and 30-year is narrower, at 68 basis points, or 0.68 percentage points. That is the flattest since the early weeks of the pandemic in March, 2020.</em></li>\n<li><em>A flattening yield curve can indicate that investors are worried about a weakening economy.&quot;</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/the-first-fed-rate-hike-is-now-expected-as-early-as-july-following-the-hot-cpi-data.html?&amp;qsearchterm=flatten%20yield%20curve\">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/the-first-fed-rate-hike-is-now-expected-as-early-as-july-following-the-hot-cpi-data.html?&amp;qsearchterm=flatten%20yield%20curve</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qr5eb1/just_some_thoughts_on_some_things_starting_to/","title":"Just some thoughts on some things starting to worry me about the near to mid term markets","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T11:51:12.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 11:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qr5eb1","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qr5eb1/just_some_thoughts_on_some_things_starting_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qr5eb1/just_some_thoughts_on_some_things_starting_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rageinrageout","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rageinrageout","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rageinrageout","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"近・中期の市場について心配になってきたことについて、いくつか考えてみました。","the_new_excerpt":"ただ、私が注目しているいくつかの指標に注目してみました。\n\n\n\n * S&P の CAPE Schiller P/E 10 レシオは、過去最高に近づいています。\n   (CAPE=39.29)。CAPE は、他の分析手法のように不況を予測するのに優れているわけではありません。\n   景気後退の予測には他の分析手法ほど優れていませんが、2つのポイントが目立っています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"只是对一些开始让我对近中期市场感到担忧的事情的一些想法","the_new_excerpt":"只是想对我一直关注的几个指标给予一些关注。\n\n\n\n * 标准普尔的CAPE席勒市盈率10正接近历史高点\n   (CAPE=39.29)。在预测经济衰退方面，它不像其他一些分析方法那样出色。\n   分析方法，但是，有两个关键点是非常突出的。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"只是對一些開始讓我對近中期市場感到擔憂的事情的一些想法","the_new_excerpt":"只是想對我一直關注的幾個指標給予一些關注。\n\n\n\n * 標準普爾的CAPE席勒市盈率10正接近歷史高點\n   (CAPE=39.29)。在預測經濟衰退方面，它不像其他一些分析方法那樣出色。\n   分析方法，但是，有兩個關鍵點是非常突出的。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1458751697518481408","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1458751697518481408","title":"RT @negworkingcap: Q3 2021 😂 https://t.co/G4KW6IvN0i","date":"November 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @negworkingcap: 2021年第3四半期 😂 https://t.co/G4KW6IvN0i","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"2021年第3四半期 😂 https://t.co/G4KW6IvN0i"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @negworkingcap: 2021年第三季度 😂 https://t.co/G4KW6IvN0i","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"2021年第三季度 😂 https://t.co/G4KW6IvN0i"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @negworkingcap: 2021年第三季度 😂 https://t.co/G4KW6IvN0i","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"2021年第三季度 😂 https://t.co/G4KW6IvN0i"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qr5eb1","previousId":"TweetPost-1458751697518481408","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qr5eb1/just_some_thoughts_on_some_things_starting_to/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
