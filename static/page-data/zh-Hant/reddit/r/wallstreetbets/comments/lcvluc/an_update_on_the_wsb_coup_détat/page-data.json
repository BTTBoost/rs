If you haven&#39;t watched it, you should. </p>\n\n<p>While you were sleeping last night, moderators who wanted to profit from THIS community, removed the moderators you know and love. They were replaced with brand new accounts. Literally minutes old. It was a coup. </p>\n\n<p>The long and short of it is, there was a movie deal. In fact, there was more than one. There were dollar signs in their eyes. The Gamestop catalyst that propelled our community to over 8 million members attracted media attention, naturally. It&#39;s no secret <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddits-wallstreetbets-founder-sells-life-story-to-movie-producer-ratpac-entertainment-11612440001\">he who must not be named sold out</a>, as he has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caoF3jH7yG4\">in the past</a>, and some of the bad moderators were just a little behind him. </p>\n\n<p>For this reason, some moderators are no longer with us. They tried to go behind other moderator&#39;s backs to secure money for themselves, and monetize this subreddit. They even went as far to establish a website (blomberg.com) to intercept all media traffic so they themselves could profit. </p>\n\n<p>So the Reddit Admins intervened. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the moderators who grew this community, like <a href=\"/u/zjz\">u/zjz</a> still have not been added back. Perhaps they will be back in the future. The good news is, the right moderators, the mods you all know and love, are coming back, and some already are here. People I know wouldn&#39;t take a dime, are taking back control, one meme filled shitpost at a time. </p>\n\n<p>He who must not be named still has a movie deal, so I leave you with this question: </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you feel about a guy who has been scamming people for most of his adult life, getting paid six figures for a movie deal partially about scamming members of WallStreetBets?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One more thing... Instead of guilding me, I request you spend the money on helping end childhood cancer, by donating to <a href=\"https://www.stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html\">St. Jude Children&#39;s Research Hospital</a>.
