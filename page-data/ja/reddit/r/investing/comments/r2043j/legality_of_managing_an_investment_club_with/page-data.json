In general for you own portion of capital in a sector you will defer to the opinion of the &#39;specialist&#39; on where to invest it, and they to you for whatever you specialize in. There are also friends who follow along with us but do not have the time to research anything and so do not provide insights.</p>\n\n<p>This got us thinking, wouldn&#39;t it be convenient to just pool our money in a club and let everyone handle their specialty independently but the effects would be felt collectively. John handles all the healthcare investments, Brian the banking, Steve the tech, etc. From what I have read on investment clubs its pretty clear that those who would actually manage investments can all form a club together and we wouldn&#39;t need any sort of licensing. The question comes in with the silent members who do not research or invest themselves. If we had 4 people making the decisions and 6 whose money was in the partnership but they made no input, would this mean the 4 &#39;managers&#39; need licensing?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if we were to divide the partnership in a way that the active members received more through ownership means, would this break the rules for an investment club? Ex: Brain and Steve form an investment club and both contribute $50,000. Brain manages and makes all investment decisions so he gets a 60% interest in the LLC while Steve gets 40%. From my own understanding and research it seems this should be allowed under &#39;sweat equity&#39; rules but I know investing is subject to special stipulations.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, I am aware of the old &#39;never invest your friends money&#39; saying but we are all adults&#39; with experience and this represents a tiny fraction of each of our net worth&#39;s. Appreciate any input!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/r2043j/legality_of_managing_an_investment_club_with/","title":"Legality of managing an investment club with friends","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-25T22:19:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-25 22:19","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r2043j","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r2043j/legality_of_managing_an_investment_club_with/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/r2043j/legality_of_managing_an_investment_club_with/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Lord_Vindicare","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lord_Vindicare","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Lord_Vindicare","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"友人と投資クラブを運営することの合法性","the_new_excerpt":"友人たちと私はしばらくの間、投資を続けてきました。\nそれぞれが自分の「エリア」に焦点を当てています。一般的には、ある分野に自分の資本の一部を投じる場合は\nどこに投資すべきかについては、「専門家」の意見に従うことになります。\nそして、あなたが専門としている分野については、彼らがあなたに意見を述べます。また、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"与朋友一起管理投资俱乐部的合法性","the_new_excerpt":"我和一群朋友已经投资了一段时间，我们每个人都有自己的\n自己关注的 \"领域\"。一般来说，对于你自己在一个部门的部分资本\n你会听从 \"专家 \"的意见，把它投资在哪里，而\n他们会听从你的意见，因为你擅长的是什么。也有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"與朋友一起管理投資俱樂部的合法性","the_new_excerpt":"我和一羣朋友已經投資了一段時間，我們每個人都有自己的\n自己關注的 \"領域\"。一般來說，對於你自己在一個部門的部分資本\n你會聽從 \"專家 \"的意見，把它投資在哪裏，而\n他們會聽從你的意見，因爲你擅長的是什麼。也有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1463871698948829193","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1463871698948829193","title":"Markets are closed today.
