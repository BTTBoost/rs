There&#39;s nowhere else to park money, I get it. I&#39;m just asking... when is that going to stop being the answer? </p>\n\n<p>When are people going to run out of cash to deploy? How many people are really buying in at these levels weekly with any sizable volume? I get it, everybody here is dollar-cost-averaging $500/mo into their 401k irregardless and they want a badge of honor on how they ignore the market and are sticking to their great 30 year long investment plan. Amazing. Congratulations. My question is... is that&#39;s what is driving the market up 40% in 14 months? Regular John Smith&#39;s 401k on his $120k/yr salary? I doubt it.</p>\n\n<p>I thought on a good year, when earnings beat estimates and forecasts were positive and not revised downward, we could reliably expect companies to grow so much that overall the market averages 10% of growth before inflation.</p>\n\n<p>How the heck are we up 39% from August 2020 to now? Are the 505 companies inside of the S&amp;P 39% more profitable/forward looking than they were then? </p>\n\n<p>The money the Fed printed for stimulus + CoVID relief... has it left the &quot;banking&quot; system? It went fed -&gt; banks. Are the banks lending it out? If not... I know that money &quot;exists&quot; on paper but... is it really in circulation? Who got it and who spent it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qwfn97/how_much_longer_can_the_market_keep_going_up/","title":"How much longer can the market keep going up under the premise of \"it's because of the low interest rate environment\"?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-18T07:13:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-18 07:13","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qwfn97","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qwfn97/how_much_longer_can_the_market_keep_going_up/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qwfn97/how_much_longer_can_the_market_keep_going_up/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"waltwhitman83","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/waltwhitman83","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"waltwhitman83","score":47,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"低金利の環境だから」という前提で、いつまで市場が上がり続けるのか。","the_new_excerpt":"私は、市場が何らかの形でプルバックする良い理由が思い浮かばない。\n「しかし、なぜ市場がコヴィッド前の高値から37％も上昇しているのか、なぜ\nまた、なぜ市場が噴火前の高値から37％も上昇しているのか、なぜ今のようなペースで上昇し続けているのかもわからない。\n私には理解できません。\n\n大金を持っている人がたくさんいることは知っていますが（私の中では...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在 \"这是因为低利率环境 \"的前提下，市场还能持续上涨多久？","the_new_excerpt":"我想不出有什么好理由让市场在某种程度上回调。\n\"炽热的暴跌 \"15%，但我也不明白为什么市场从暴跌前的高点上涨了37%，而且还在以它的速度继续攀升。\n但我也不明白，为什么市场会从暴跌前的高点上涨37%，以及为什么它继续以它的速度不断攀升\n攀升的速度。\n\n我知道有一大批人有很多钱（在我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在 \"這是因爲低利率環境 \"的前提下，市場還能持續上漲多久？","the_new_excerpt":"我想不出有什麼好理由讓市場在某種程度上回調。\n\"熾熱的暴跌 \"15%，但我也不明白爲什麼市場從暴跌前的高點上漲了37%，而且還在以它的速度繼續攀升。\n但我也不明白，爲什麼市場會從暴跌前的高點上漲37%，以及爲什麼它繼續以它的速度不斷攀升\n攀升的速度。\n\n我知道有一大批人有很多錢（在我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qvxw3l","excerpt":"Rivian's IPO really opened my eyes to the bubble that is the EV market.\n\nLet's think logically: How can general motors stock be 90b and Tesla's stock be\n1T.\n\nLet's say they eventually sell as many cars as Toyota (400b Market cap), their\ncurrent valuation is still 2x this, and they aren't even close…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvxw3l/ev_bubble/","title":"EV Bubble","date":"November 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"EVバブル","the_new_excerpt":"リビアンのIPOで、EV市場のバブルぶりに目が覚めました。\n\n論理的に考えてみましょう。ゼネラルモーターズの株価が900億円で、テスラの株価が1,000億円なのはなぜ？\n1T.\n\n最終的にトヨタ（時価総額4億円）と同じ数の車を販売するとします。\n現在の評価額はこの2倍ですが、それにも及ばない...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"电动汽车泡沫","the_new_excerpt":"Rivian公司的IPO确实让我看到了电动车市场的泡沫。\n\n让我们从逻辑上思考。通用汽车的股票是900亿，而特斯拉的股票是\n1T.\n\n假设他们最终卖出的汽车和丰田（4000亿市值）一样多，他们目前的估值仍然是这个数字的2倍。\n他们目前的估值仍然是这个数字的2倍，而他们甚至还没有接近...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"電動汽車泡沫","the_new_excerpt":"Rivian公司的IPO確實讓我看到了電動車市場的泡沫。\n\n讓我們從邏輯上思考。通用汽車的股票是900億，而特斯拉的股票是\n1T.\n\n假設他們最終賣出的汽車和豐田（4000億市值）一樣多，他們目前的估值仍然是這個數字的2倍。\n他們目前的估值仍然是這個數字的2倍，而他們甚至還沒有接近...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qwfn97","previousId":"RedditPost-qvxw3l","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qwfn97/how_much_longer_can_the_market_keep_going_up/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
