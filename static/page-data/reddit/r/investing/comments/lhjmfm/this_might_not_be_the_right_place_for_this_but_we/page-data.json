Need a rant. </p>\n\n<p>I believe Wealthsimple’s recent marketing campaigns are predatory. I know there is a start-up definition for predatory marketing with a slightly positive connotation - this is not the case here. They are intentionally misleading new entrants to the world of investing. </p>\n\n<p>———————————————————</p>\n\n<p>I deleted my Wealthsimple trade account a while ago (moved to QT). They have gamified investing while pursuing a very important initiative of making investing for everyone. I want to be clear that i endorse this pursuit... However, they have now lost the plot. Entirely. </p>\n\n<p>Some examples of practises I see all day every day on almost every platform:</p>\n\n<p>• Misleading: account chart always green. Demonstrating gains only on weekly - yearly basis</p>\n\n<p>• Language: trading versus investing. Purposefully oversimplifying the investment process </p>\n\n<p>• Tickers: purposefully advertising hot tech stocks and the like </p>\n\n<p>• Branding: it’s a young person in a tik tok like video telling you to just download the app and makes those buys and sells. It’s turned the pursuit of learning about businesses and buying good ones into a tik tok trend</p>\n\n<p>• Positioning: commercials trying to make the founder seem like an outsider who is standing up to the big guys - this is not the case. You are trading all the time, you can’t walk your dog without checking your account or making a trade </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on. It is so fucking annoying to see. </p>\n\n<p>What are people’s thoughts on this? Am I overreacting, this really scares me</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","title":"This might not be the right place for this - but we should talk about WealthSimple’s marketing.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T17:39:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 17:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f9baf625-fe43-5e8b-a092-2fa60feb7c78","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lhjmfm/this_might_not_be_the_right_place_for_this_but_we/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Pure-arbitrage","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pure-arbitrage","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Pure-arbitrage","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"这可能不是合适的地方 - 但我们应该谈谈WealthSimple的营销。","the_new_excerpt":"版主：如果这个不合适，对不起。根据需要指点我其他地方。需要发发牢骚。\n\n我认为Wealthsimple最近的营销活动是掠夺性的。我知道有\n是掠夺式营销的创业定义，略带正能量的\n内涵--这里不是这样的。他们是故意...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這可能不是合適的地方 - 但我們應該談談WealthSimple的營銷。","the_new_excerpt":"版主：如果這個不合適，對不起。根據需要指點我其他地方。需要發發牢騷。\n\n我認爲Wealthsimple最近的營銷活動是掠奪性的。我知道有\n是掠奪式營銷的創業定義，略帶正能量的\n內涵--這裏不是這樣的。他們是故意...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-1f59905a-d6e5-508f-86ca-36cfdfc8fcb7","excerpt":"Webull, yahoo finance, sub reddits...all these messages boards copy and paste\nthe same exact info whether it's \"to the moon\" or \"dd\" or even wild claims\nexpecting the stock go hit crazy high numbers.
