&lt;p&gt;My personal takeaways: 60/40 is still okay-ish as in 2021. Higher returns can be achieved via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PE (private equity, not widely accessible to individual investors AFAIK other than SPAC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global Transport (Cannot find a corresponding ETF. Perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/299086/blackrock-future-of-transport-fund&quot;&gt;https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/299086/blackrock-future-of-transport-fund&lt;/a&gt; but given that it&amp;#39;s a UCITS fund US investors need to purchase via a fund manager)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value-add real-estate (Fundrise provided a value-add fund to accredited investors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global infrastructure ($IGF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct landing (Yieldstreet? Worth checking the fee structure and the underlying products)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EM debt (tons of closed-end funds and ETFs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it&amp;#39;s a very detailed a report covering lots of topics including inflation, crypto, tax hikes and 60/40 for 2022 with statistics. Highly recommend giving it a read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks finished mixed today, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closing modestly in the red, breaking an insane rally pulled down by a decline in Tesla (TSLA) while the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) continued their march higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, finished the day 0.33% higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Labor Department released the monthly October jobs report, which showed the pace of employment greatly improved after two disappointing months, with the report citing declining coronavirus cases and increased demand for workers for the uptick. Here are the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in non-farm payrolls, October:&lt;/strong&gt; +531,000 vs. +450,000 expected, and a great improvement over the +194,000 job added in September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unemployment rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 4.6% vs. 4.7% expected, 4.8% in September&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a press conference, President Joe Biden said of the Labor report, “Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. In this historically strong recovery, unemployment has fallen again today,” President Joe Biden said during a press conference on Friday.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though payrolls have grown every month so far in 2021, the economy remains more than 4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels following plunges in employment between March and April of 2020. And the civilian labor force was still down by nearly 3 million individuals compared to February 2020 as of October 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the inflation front, market participants are closely monitoring the Bureau of Labor’s October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to show yet another acceleration in consumer prices on both a monthly and annual basis, as ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances continue to cap production of goods at a time of soaring demand. Estimates as of Monday showed that consensus economists expect to see the CPI rise by 5.9% in October compared to last year, accelerating from September&amp;#39;s 5.4% annual rate to reach the fastest rise since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rubella Farooqi, Chief Economist at High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to clients, “We continue to expect that a normalization of demand and supply constraint or time will take pressure off inflation statistics. The exact timing is uncertain, given we cannot predict when supply chains will adjust. However, our best guess is that prices will start moderating by the middle of next year - possibly sooner if goods that are stuff in ports reach their destinations in the early part of the year, which will result in an excess supply of goods after holidays.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ford Motors (F) crossed the $20 per share threshold for the first time since mid-2001, with investors seemingly encouraged by the company’s pivot into electric vehicles and the upcoming blockbuster Rivian IPO, of which Ford owns 12%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell today but held onto the critical $1150 support after CEO Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers via a poll if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, a position worth roughly $20 billion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though it was unable to hold the gains by close, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) became the third company to breach the $2 trillion market cap threshold, joining Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italy&amp;#39;s antitrust regulator has started proceedings to fine Google for allegedly restrictive clauses in the terms of service consumers have to accept to use Google Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged more than 10% after Meta Platforms (FB, soon to be MVRS) selected their chips to power its data center. AMD explained that the two companies worked together to develop a high performance processor based on the company’s 3rd Generation EPYC Processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moreover, AMD announced new chips called  &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1032/new-amd-instinct-mi200-series-accelerators-bring&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are optimized for high-performance computing and artificial-intelligence workloads. The company described them as &amp;quot;the first exascale-class GPU accelerators.&amp;quot; AMD competes with &lt;strong&gt;Nvidia&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;NVDA&lt;/strong&gt;) in GPUs. Sorry it sounds like jargon but as a massive semiconductor bull I could not be more excited for the future. I’ve said it many times before but personally NVDA is my #1, AMD is my #2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SoftBank’s Vision Fund, the largest tech-focused investment firm in the world with over $100 billion in capital, lost $10 billion this quarter amid the regulatory crackdown in China. The fund announced it was launching a $9 billion share buyback amid pressure from investors. The group’s largest asset, Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba , saw its valuation fall by around a third in the second quarter. Its stake in Chinese ride-hailer Didi, acquired for $12 billion, was valued at $7.5 billion. Another notable hit was Coupang (CPNG), a South Korean eCommerce company which gave up a third of its value.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue: $6.18 billion vs. $6.23 billion expected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal reported a 13% increase in year-over-year revenue for the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company issued a fourth-quarter forecast that fell well short of analysts’ expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting next year, customers will be able to make purchases on Amazon.com and the Amazon mobile shopping app using their Venmo accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock is down 5% after the earning report. It has been down from $310 to $230 and it is definitely oversold. Investors should buy the stock here as PayPal is still growing very healthy and there is still plenty of opportunities for PayPal to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nov 8 (Reuters) - Roblox Corp exceeded market estimates for quarterly bookings on Monday as demand for its video games &amp;quot;MeepCity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Adopt Me!&amp;quot; stayed strong even after pandemic-led curbs eased.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Roblox, among the world&amp;#39;s most popular gaming sites for children, jumped 14% in extended trading.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People had turned to video games for entertainment during last year&amp;#39;s months-long isolation, sparking a boom that is yet to slow down despite the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from analytics firm Sensor Tower shows consumer spending on video games rose 7.7% in the third quarter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Mateo, California-based Roblox has capitalized on the boom by allowing users to create an in-game metaverse, a shared virtual world where people in the form of avatars can interact with others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company posted a 28% rise in bookings to $637.8 million for the third quarter. Analysts had expected bookings of $636.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk and other executives have many other generous in the money stock option awards, that will require both collateral to exercise and tax to be paid which can only realistically come from share sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla shareholders, like.most company shareholders in their defence, so often overlook the dilution effect of stock options and the inevitable share sell down by executives to cover the collateral needed to exercise the options and to pay any taxes due.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chip giant said its EPYC chips were selected by Meta (formerly known as Facebook) to help power its data centers at its virtual Accelerated Data Center Premiere event Monday. AMD explained the two companies worked together to develop a high-performance, power-efficient processor based on the company&amp;#39;s 3rd Generation EPYC processor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-profile win accompanied several announcements from AMD, including some specifics around upcoming EPYC processors codenamed “Genoa” and “Bergamo.” AMD dubbed the Genoa processor as the &amp;quot;world’s highest performance processor for general purpose computing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The magnitude of the expected rate hike is tiny, maybe a quarter-percent. If you are of the belief that supply-chain shortages will last well into 2022, this is hilariously inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we&amp;#39;ve seen from 10 years of monetary experiments that the direct relationship between inflation and the state of the economy + monetary policy is tenuous at best. And this has benefitted the economy at large as we have pumped more and more money and cheap debt into the system with no apparent ill effects (except the ones that we choose to ignore, but I&amp;#39;m not here to beat that debt horse!). So it&amp;#39;s already ridiculous to believe that the converse won&amp;#39;t also be true. A 25 basis-point increase will do nothing to temper inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have a new phenomenon that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seem to have a strong connection to inflation, both in theory and in practice. Inflation expectations among spenders and workers are higher than they&amp;#39;ve been in over a decade, wage increases at the bottom are faster than they&amp;#39;ve been in over a decade, and supply chains are more constricted than they&amp;#39;ve been in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if inflation persists, even at the not-hyper-inflation levels we&amp;#39;re currently seeing, it&amp;#39;s not a stretch to see that the Fed will have to make moves that shatter the confidence driving the second point. Once you accept the first point, that the Fed&amp;#39;s tools have a weak causal relationship with inflation, it&amp;#39;s clear that the only way they can stop inflation is to raise interest rates enough to tank assets, which will shake consumer confidence and bring demand in equilibrium with supply. If that isn&amp;#39;t enough, they will be forced to go further and cause a recession, although this will take a lot of pushing, given their need to balance against the full employment mandate. Either way, I think we can all agree a quarter rate increase will do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious what other people&amp;#39;s thoughts are. I&amp;#39;m not making any earth-shattering new statements, just connecting dots. To me, this outcome flows logically from the two points above, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you believe that higher inflation (but not hyper-inflation) will be persistent into next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even state-owned firms are safe from the deepening rout in Chinese developer bonds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino  Ocean Group Holding Ltd., part-owned by the finance ministry, has  become the latest property company to see its bonds slump. Its 4.75%  note due 2030 fell Monday to as low as 73.48 cents on the dollar, with  spreads over comparable Treasuries widening to a record 800 basis  points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s  despite the firm being rated investment-grade at two global credit  assessors and holding about 54 times more cash and equivalents than  China Evergrande Group. Sino Ocean’s shares have been doing better,  rebounding 35% from their September low. They rose 3.5% Monday.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress  in the market for Chinese property bonds is reaching extreme levels as  surging borrowing costs make refinancing dollar debt too expensive and a  slowing housing market shrinks revenue.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s  finance ministry controls just under 30% of Sino Ocean’s shares,  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. State-owned Dajia Insurance  Group -- the company that took over most of the operations of troubled  Anbang Insurance Group Co. -- holds a similar-sized stake.&lt;/p&gt;
