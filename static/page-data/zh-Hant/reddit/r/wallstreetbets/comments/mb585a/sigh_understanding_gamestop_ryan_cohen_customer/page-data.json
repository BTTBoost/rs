Think about customer service. Think about who the customer is.</p>\n\n<p>Walk into gamestop. Walk into Pet Smart. Walk into Best Buy. Walk into Target. Ask yourself what could be better and why things are the way they are. Could we do better?</p>\n\n<p>When you’ve mastered customer service, willingness to pay increases.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9muytpqzpoo61.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef5ee3353d240709a49a6a3faafeb7986a5ac1b8\">https://preview.redd.it/9muytpqzpoo61.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef5ee3353d240709a49a6a3faafeb7986a5ac1b8</a></p>\n\n<h1>Purpose</h1>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Don’t use this DD to confirm your bias as a means to make silly choices. Use it as an opportunity to learn you dingus!</p>\n\n<p>Some of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.</p>\n\n<p>WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.</p>\n\n<p>Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? <strong>(Square DD Complete)</strong>  </p></li>\n<li><p>How do we compare social media? <strong>(Pinterest DD Complete)</strong>  </p></li>\n<li><p>What really is customer service? <strong>(You are here)</strong>  </p></li>\n<li><p>Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? <strong>(Kansas City Southern DD in Revision Mode)</strong>  </p></li>\n<li><p>Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (<strong>Google DD in Progress)</strong>  </p></li>\n<li><p>Do we understand incentives vs. bias? <strong>(Roblox DD in Progress)</strong>  </p></li>\n<li><p>How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? <strong>(You are here)</strong>  </p></li>\n<li><p>Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.</p>\n\n<h1>First Phase: Real Estate</h1>\n\n<p>Walk into Best Buy. They do some things right, and they do some things wrong. Want into the gaming section of Target. Notice the activity levels in the region, but think critically of the real-estate afforded to it. How does it affect your experience?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8\">https://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8</a></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, a floor design is a subset of customer service and sale intentions. A location that sells furniture and diet pills may not service customers the same way a place that sells gaming culture (stream, cosplay) and gaming devices products. GameStop will predictably close down smaller shops, while expanding the size of others to produce an alternative service. Gamestop will no longer be a convenience store aisle, but rather an area for culture.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf\">https://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf</a></p>\n\n<p>The reason for this is clear. Gaming is <strong>BIG</strong> where many players will win. Gaming expands multiple culture vectors. Movies, cosplay events, entertainment parks, meta-verses, sold out arenas, cafes, midnight releases and home development. If you have an industry where people WILL wait in line, you have a goldmine of an industry.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rfg1hnt9voo61.jpg?width=573&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc610af0af2faa9d17217a1836ac0ffd2991f271\">https://preview.redd.it/rfg1hnt9voo61.jpg?width=573&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc610af0af2faa9d17217a1836ac0ffd2991f271</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wl15qmicvoo61.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57fb1c160657525a45861611f5a8b335aa6544a0\">https://preview.redd.it/wl15qmicvoo61.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57fb1c160657525a45861611f5a8b335aa6544a0</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Second Phase: Customer Service</h1>\n\n<p>You as a dear millennial, or parent of a millennial, understand that gaming is larger than life, and that experience will never fundamentally change. Ryan Cohen understands this. It is the core of an American market, much like Chewey’s targeting of pets. What Ryan cohen seeks is to breech the American household rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon or Target. Ultimately, Cohen is a proud student of Jeff Bezos. This is a stated fact by himself.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mkbo52yswoo61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd04ea2474c5e72666b9ca5f01cd2d96d590bbc6\">https://preview.redd.it/mkbo52yswoo61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd04ea2474c5e72666b9ca5f01cd2d96d590bbc6</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5a1qcru48po61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8fec7d952782ffd663b399dd72361576d86fb9b\">https://preview.redd.it/5a1qcru48po61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8fec7d952782ffd663b399dd72361576d86fb9b</a></p>\n\n<p>Ask yourself:</p>\n\n<p>- What if a parent wants to buy a high-grade computer setup for their child? Is it reasonable to assume that a 54-year old mother will understand the differences between AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards?</p>\n\n<p>- What services can Gamestop capture to produce economic value for streamers, cosplay, and e-sports consumers?</p>\n\n<p>- What products exist beyond Corsair, Logitech, and other big-name products? Do small manufacturers produce good value products that customers may love?</p>\n\n<p>– Can things like Legos, Roblox, Minecraft, and Nintendo find themselves in the same space?</p>\n\n<p>- Is it possible to have GameStop create integrations with services like Unity, Steam, Roblox, and other digital services? How rapidly could GameStop capitalize on successes like Among Us or other sectors like child-gaming?</p>\n\n<p>- Can GameStop capture bigger sports and sports-betting markets?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/33q7ksn7voo61.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4042e97ce8df20e5be17824c532d1e3dfb2eace\">https://preview.redd.it/33q7ksn7voo61.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4042e97ce8df20e5be17824c532d1e3dfb2eace</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n\n<p>Despite GameStop being in a meme state, it was quite obvious that the organization was undervalued relative to the larger American or global gaming market. The company stagnated and had a weak formula for success in a rapidly evolving retail sector. I personally believe that Gamestop has the potential to sustain beyond 20-30B market cap if it operates and succeeds strategically. The first step was to have leadership that understands the larger-than-life nature of technology and culture, which it has achieved. The next step is transforming the companies space to properly service its customers and products. The final step is to overhaul the customer service to increase engagement, satisfaction, and to put the “custom” in customer.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zhm3ea7h2po61.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ccf471f1e8269b636349fce6ac57bd81ee77872\">https://preview.redd.it/zhm3ea7h2po61.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ccf471f1e8269b636349fce6ac57bd81ee77872</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0himvwbl8po61.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b8b60a889c0debf8c37c69b5cddc1517c0c53df\">Naruto: Believe It!</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.nichegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/09182715/Reggie-GameStop-03-09-2020.jpg\">https://media.nichegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/09182715/Reggie-GameStop-03-09-2020.jpg</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb585a/sigh_understanding_gamestop_ryan_cohen_customer/","title":"*SIGH* Understanding GameStop: Ryan Cohen, Customer Service, and The Great Long.
