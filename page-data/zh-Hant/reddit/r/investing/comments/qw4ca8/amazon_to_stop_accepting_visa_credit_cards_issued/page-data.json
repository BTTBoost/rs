Users are being encouraged to update their default payment method ahead of the changes.</strong> The news was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-will-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-u-k?srnd=technology-vp\">Bloomberg</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Visa said it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.”  </p>\n\n<p>“U.K. shoppers can use their Visa debit and credit cards at Amazon U.K. today and throughout the holiday season,” a Visa spokesperson told CNBC.  </p>\n\n<p>“We have a long-standing relationship with Amazon, and we continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon U.K. without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.”  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon blasted Visa for its high card charges. “The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers,” a spokesperson for the company told CNBC.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>“These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise.”</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The move could be viewed as a way for Amazon to get some bargaining power over Visa to lower its fees. The payments firm also charges businesses scheme fees to become part of its network.  </p>\n\n<p>While smaller retailers aren’t in a position to negotiate, Amazon — given its size — may have better luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/amazon-to-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-uk.html\">CNBC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE\">Visa is down about 5%</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qw4ca8/amazon_to_stop_accepting_visa_credit_cards_issued/","title":"Amazon to stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the UK, citing high fees","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-17T18:33:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-17 18:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qw4ca8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qw4ca8/amazon_to_stop_accepting_visa_credit_cards_issued/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qw4ca8/amazon_to_stop_accepting_visa_credit_cards_issued/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ChocolateTsar","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChocolateTsar","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ChocolateTsar","score":163,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"アマゾン、英国で発行されたVisaクレジットカードの利用を停止、手数料が高いため","the_new_excerpt":"> キーポイント\n> \n> アマゾンは一部のお客様に対し、1月19日以降、英国で発行されたVisaクレジットカードを\n> 英国で発行されたVisaのクレジットカードが使えなくなります。\n> \n> その理由として、決済代行会社の手数料が高いことが挙げられています。\n> \n> Visaは、「アマゾンが英国で発行されたVisaカードを受け付けないと脅していることに非常に失望している」と述べています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"亚马逊将停止接受在英国发行的Visa信用卡，理由是费用高昂","the_new_excerpt":"> 关键点\n> \n> 亚马逊已经告诉一些客户，从1月19日起，该公司将不再接受\n> 不再接受在英国发行的Visa信用卡。\n> \n> 该电子商务巨头以支付处理商收取的高额费用为由。\n> \n> 维萨公司表示，它 \"对亚马逊威胁要在英国使用维萨信用卡感到非常失望\"。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"亞馬遜將停止接受在英國發行的Visa信用卡，理由是費用高昂","the_new_excerpt":"> 關鍵點\n> \n> 亞馬遜已經告訴一些客戶，從1月19日起，該公司將不再接受\n> 不再接受在英國發行的Visa信用卡。\n> \n> 該電子商務巨頭以支付處理商收取的高額費用爲由。\n> \n> 維薩公司表示，它 \"對亞馬遜威脅要在英國使用維薩信用卡感到非常失望\"。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qw1iz3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw1iz3/still_a_gem/","title":"Still a GEM","date":"November 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"まだまだ元気です。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"仍然是一颗宝石","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"仍然是一顆寶石","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qvta30","excerpt":"Is the industry at large grossly overestimating people's appetite to spend X\namount of time in a video game?\n\nI actually watched facebook's entire presentation on meta.
