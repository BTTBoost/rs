DO your own DD. </p>\n\n<p>Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there… eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.</p>\n\n<p>The Stock I am talking about is CVS… </p>\n\n<p>Well, I couldn’t believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven’t done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.</p>\n\n<p>#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven’t. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn’t need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like “Oh wow, my wife’s boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring”.  So, increase in sales </p>\n\n<p>#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don’t believe in the F word. </p>\n\n<p>· According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it’s fair value</p>\n\n<p>· PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x</p>\n\n<p>· Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions </p>\n\n<p>· Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities</p>\n\n<p>· *Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B</p>\n\n<p>· Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) </p>\n\n<p>· Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) </p>\n\n<p>· Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings </p>\n\n<p>#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‘in house’ offerings. </p>\n\n<p>#4  Institutional  Ownership </p>\n\n<p>· Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)</p>\n\n<p>· BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)</p>\n\n<p>· State Street $3.4B (4%)</p>\n\n<p>· Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)</p>\n\n<p>· Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)</p>\n\n<p>#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side</p>\n\n<p>Amazon’s disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.</p>\n\n<p>#6 More than a Pharmacy </p>\n\n<p>· Aetna – Health Insurance plans </p>\n\n<p>· Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores </p>\n\n<p>· CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub </p>\n\n<p>· Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. </p>\n\n<p>Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It’s not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR</p>\n\n<p>· High Ownership from mutual Funds</p>\n\n<p>· 10% of Michael Burry’s portfolio</p>\n\n<p>· Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. </p>\n\n<p>· In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor) </p>\n\n<p>- A company that is resilient and continues to find a way to keep moving forward</p>\n\n<p>My Position - 140 shares held (New portfolio after buying my house).</p>\n\n<p>Edit - mandatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p>Also, concern over my account age-  I have been a lurker for 2 years. Really loved WSB; saw the trash of DD in the last 2 weeks and thought I’d try to begin a change back to the norm, but had to create an account. </p>\n\n<p>To confirm I’m not a boomer- at the age of 10 I cried during the Pokémon movie when Ash Died.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfvg9b/cvs_10_of_michael_burrys_portfolio_and_why_it_is/","title":"CVS- 10% of Michael Burry's portfolio and why it is in mine","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T18:40:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 18:40","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d9366130-0e65-52a1-a990-2f9e86c6fe3a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfvg9b/cvs_10_of_michael_burrys_portfolio_and_why_it_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfvg9b/cvs_10_of_michael_burrys_portfolio_and_why_it_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Shepherdspie_inyaeye","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shepherdspie_inyaeye","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Shepherdspie_inyaeye","score":1382,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CVS--迈克尔-伯里投资组合的10%，为什么它在我的投资组合中？","the_new_excerpt":"聪明的钱让你赚钱。\n\n这不是理财建议。做你自己的DD。\n\n在我入手之前，看我选股的时候，我喜欢看什么机构？\n拥有他们，看看是否有聪明的钱在那里... ... 例如凯西木，迈克尔-伯里。\n\n我说的股票是CVS... ...\n\n我不敢相信... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CVS--邁克爾-伯裏投資組合的10%，爲什麼它在我的投資組合中？","the_new_excerpt":"聰明的錢讓你賺錢。\n\n這不是理財建議。做你自己的DD。\n\n在我入手之前，看我選股的時候，我喜歡看什麼機構？\n擁有他們，看看是否有聰明的錢在那裏... ... 例如凱西木，邁克爾-伯裏。\n\n我說的股票是CVS... ...\n\n我不敢相信... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ff7a473d-7b30-55d6-8f34-bc212477b73c","excerpt":"I understand, fuck Melvin, fuck the hedges, fuck some brokers.
