And they are absolutely obliterating them.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why they bailed out Melvin, because it’s their problem anyways. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, I believe we have uncovered is that the Citadel fund and Citadel Securities - both of which are owned by the same Griffin guy - only have (had) about $35-$40B of assets to their name collectively.</p>\n\n<p>They’ve already had to bailout Melvin to the tune of $2B. And that was at GME $150.  </p>\n\n<p>That’s pretty wild considering CS’ total “record” revenue in 2020 was 6B.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also learned that short interest in GME is INCREASING, and this may not let up.</p>\n\n<p>So what if GME actually goes above $500? That might sound crazy, but that’s a move from like  $15B market cap to $35B market cap? We all know that’s actually possible in this market.</p>\n\n<p>What if the short squeeze mania spills out into the other heavily shorted stocks?</p>\n\n<p>Pretty concerning for CS because, I’ve also learned that Citadel Securities is responsible for processing about 25%-40% of ALL stock market transactions.</p>\n\n<p>So uh. What if they go bankrupt?</p>\n\n<p>I don’t mean to be speaking in extremes, but is this potentially a 2008 mortgage backed securities crisis type of situation?</p>\n\n<p>Serious educated answers would be sincerely appreciated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l5y4s7/what_if_citadel_securities_goes_bankrupt/","title":"What if Citadel Securities goes bankrupt???","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T10:29:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 10:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"fc6e78d7-8483-545c-9211-229a82ee90fe","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5y4s7/what_if_citadel_securities_goes_bankrupt/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5y4s7/what_if_citadel_securities_goes_bankrupt/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Troflecopter","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Troflecopter","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Troflecopter","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"如果城投证券破产了，怎么办？","the_new_excerpt":"我和我的朋友对这些人造成的负债进行了深入的研究。\n疯狂的空头挤压。\n\n我认为我们发现的是，如果这些空头挤压继续下去，并且。\n卖出它们的对冲基金破产，这些仓位最终将是。\n像Citadel这样的做市商的责任...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果城投證券破產了，怎麼辦？","the_new_excerpt":"我和我的朋友對這些人造成的負債進行了深入的研究。\n瘋狂的空頭擠壓。\n\n我認爲我們發現的是，如果這些空頭擠壓繼續下去，並且。\n賣出它們的對沖基金破產，這些倉位最終將是。\n像Citadel這樣的做市商的責任...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1354284386670284802","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1354284386670284802","title":"THE FLU, RIP https://t.co/VlUR1C89eX","date":"January 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"The FLU, RIP https://t.co/VlUR1C89eX","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"The FLU, RIP https://t.co/VlUR1C89eX","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-81738d38-5e9b-5997-aa93-133034a303a9","excerpt":"Wrapping up my first year trading and I’ve been snowballing my earnings, what\nI’m unsure of is do you pay taxes on all earnings even if they haven’t been\ntaken from the portfolio?
