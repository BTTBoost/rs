There is a chance that a rise in inflation would be “more than temporary,” he wrote, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively. “Rapidly raising rates to offset an overheating economy is a typical cause of a recession,” he wrote, but he hopes for “the Goldilocks scenario” of fast growth, gently increasing inflation and a measured rise in interest rates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.”</strong> Mr. Dimon cited competition from an already large shadow banking system and fintech companies, as well as “Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and now Walmart.” He argued those nonbank competitors should be more strictly regulated; their growth has “partially been made possible” by avoiding banking rules, he wrote. And when it comes to tougher regulation of big banks, he wrote, “the cost to the economy of having fail-safe banks may not be worth it.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>“China’s leaders believe that America is in decline.”</strong> The United States has faced tough times before, but today, “the Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education — a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality — and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>“The solution is not as simple as walking away from fossil fuels.”</strong> Addressing climate change doesn’t mean “abandoning” companies that produce and use fossil fuels, Mr. Dimon wrote, but working with them to reduce their environmental impact. He sees “huge opportunity in sustainable and low-carbon technologies and businesses” and plans to evaluate clients’ progress according to reductions in carbon intensity — emissions per unit of output — which adjusts for factors like size.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other notable news (and views) from the letter:</strong></p>\n\n<p>With more widespread remote working, JPMorgan may need only 60 seats for every 100 employees. “This will significantly reduce our need for real estate,” Mr. Dimon wrote.</p>\n\n<p>JPMorgan spends more than $600 million a year on cybersecurity.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Dimon cited tax loopholes he thought the United States could do without: carried interest, tax breaks for racing cars, private jets and horse racing, and a land conservation tax break for golf courses.</p>\n\n<p>This was Mr. Dimon’s longest letter yet, at 35,000 words over 66 pages. The steadily expanding letters — aside from a shorter edition last year, weeks after Mr. Dimon had emergency heart surgery — could be seen as a reflection of the range of issues top executives are now expected, or compelled, to address.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/07/business/stock-market-today/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-predicts-an-economic-boom-that-could-easily-run-into-2023\">https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/07/business/stock-market-today/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-predicts-an-economic-boom-that-could-easily-run-into-2023</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/mm1wn7/the_annual_letter_to_shareholders_by_jpmorgan/","title":"The annual letter to shareholders by JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"April 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-04-07T14:35:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-04-07 14:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a0a47bb6-c7ee-5656-9c45-67303b37a49b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mm1wn7/the_annual_letter_to_shareholders_by_jpmorgan/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mm1wn7/the_annual_letter_to_shareholders_by_jpmorgan/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"JoeManchinOwnsYou","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JoeManchinOwnsYou","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"JoeManchinOwnsYou","score":373,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"JPモルガン・チェースのCEO、ジェイミー・ダイモンが株主に宛てた年次報告書","the_new_excerpt":"> \"米国経済は好景気になる可能性が高い \"と言われています。過剰貯蓄、赤字の組み合わせ\n> 支出、ワクチン接種、そして「パンデミックの終息に向けた幸福感」の組み合わせにより、「2023年まで容易に続く」好況をもたらす可能性があると、ダイモン氏は書いています。\n> ダイモン氏は、「2023年まで続くかもしれない」好景気を生み出す可能性があると書いています。それは、高い株価評価を正当化する可能性があります。\n> それは株式の高い評価を正当化するが、米国債の価格は正当化されない...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"摩根大通首席执行官杰米-戴蒙的年度致股东信。","the_new_excerpt":">\"美国经济将可能蓬勃发展\" 超额储蓄、赤字的组合\n>支出、疫苗接种和 \"围绕大流行病结束的兴奋\"，先生。\n> Dimon写道，可能会创造一个繁荣，\"可以很容易地运行到2023年\"。这可能\n>证明高股票估值的合理性，但不能证明美债价格的合理性，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"摩根大通首席執行官傑米-戴蒙的年度致股東信。","the_new_excerpt":">\"美國經濟將可能蓬勃發展\" 超額儲蓄、赤字的組合\n>支出、疫苗接種和 \"圍繞大流行病結束的興奮\"，先生。\n> Dimon寫道，可能會創造一個繁榮，\"可以很容易地運行到2023年\"。這可能\n>證明高股票估值的合理性，但不能證明美債價格的合理性，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-32027d3d-5d17-538a-b455-ded909548c83","excerpt":"Tesla’s stock price soared during Monday trading following the report of\nimpressive Q1 2021 delivery and production numbers last Friday.
