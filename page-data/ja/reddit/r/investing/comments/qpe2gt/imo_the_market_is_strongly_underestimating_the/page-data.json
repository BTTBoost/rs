The magnitude of the expected rate hike is tiny, maybe a quarter-percent. If you are of the belief that supply-chain shortages will last well into 2022, this is hilariously inadequate.</p>\n\n<p>First, we&#39;ve seen from 10 years of monetary experiments that the direct relationship between inflation and the state of the economy + monetary policy is tenuous at best. And this has benefitted the economy at large as we have pumped more and more money and cheap debt into the system with no apparent ill effects (except the ones that we choose to ignore, but I&#39;m not here to beat that debt horse!). So it&#39;s already ridiculous to believe that the converse won&#39;t also be true. A 25 basis-point increase will do nothing to temper inflation.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we have a new phenomenon that <em>does</em> seem to have a strong connection to inflation, both in theory and in practice. Inflation expectations among spenders and workers are higher than they&#39;ve been in over a decade, wage increases at the bottom are faster than they&#39;ve been in over a decade, and supply chains are more constricted than they&#39;ve been in a decade.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if inflation persists, even at the not-hyper-inflation levels we&#39;re currently seeing, it&#39;s not a stretch to see that the Fed will have to make moves that shatter the confidence driving the second point. Once you accept the first point, that the Fed&#39;s tools have a weak causal relationship with inflation, it&#39;s clear that the only way they can stop inflation is to raise interest rates enough to tank assets, which will shake consumer confidence and bring demand in equilibrium with supply. If that isn&#39;t enough, they will be forced to go further and cause a recession, although this will take a lot of pushing, given their need to balance against the full employment mandate. Either way, I think we can all agree a quarter rate increase will do nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m curious what other people&#39;s thoughts are. I&#39;m not making any earth-shattering new statements, just connecting dots. To me, this outcome flows logically from the two points above, <em>if</em> you believe that higher inflation (but not hyper-inflation) will be persistent into next year.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qpe2gt/imo_the_market_is_strongly_underestimating_the/","title":"IMO the market is strongly underestimating the magnitude of rate hikes required to temper inflation","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-08T15:49:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-08 15:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qpe2gt","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qpe2gt/imo_the_market_is_strongly_underestimating_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qpe2gt/imo_the_market_is_strongly_underestimating_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"jalalipop","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jalalipop","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jalalipop","score":951,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"IMOは、インフレ抑制のために必要な利上げの規模を市場は大きく過小評価している。","the_new_excerpt":"私が読んだ新しい情報源によると、市場は22年夏頃に最初の利上げを行うと予測しているというのがコンセンサスのようです。\n夏の22日頃に最初の利上げを行うとの見方で一致しています。予想される利上げの大きさは\nその大きさは4分の1パーセント程度の小さなものです。もし、あなたが、サプライチェーンの不足が長く続くと考えているなら\nもしあなたが、サプライチェーンの不足が2022年まで続くと考えているなら、これは滑稽なほど...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"IMO：市场强烈低估了抑制通胀所需的加息幅度","the_new_excerpt":"在我阅读的所有新消息来源中，人们似乎一致认为，市场正在为22年夏季的首次加息定价。\n对夏季22日左右的首次加息进行定价。预计加息的幅度\n加息的幅度很小，可能是四分之一个百分点。如果你认为\n供应链短缺将持续到2022年，这就很搞笑了。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"IMO：市場強烈低估了抑制通脹所需的加息幅度","the_new_excerpt":"在我閱讀的所有新消息來源中，人們似乎一致認爲，市場正在爲22年夏季的首次加息定價。\n對夏季22日左右的首次加息進行定價。預計加息的幅度\n加息的幅度很小，可能是四分之一個百分點。如果你認爲\n供應鏈短缺將持續到2022年，這就很搞笑了。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qpbopa","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpbopa/red_light/","title":"Red light!","date":"November 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"赤色光!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"红灯!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"紅燈!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qp3kz4","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/qp3kz4/never_bear_too_much_or_too_little_risk_bogleheads/","title":"Never bear too much or too little risk (Bogleheads philosophy - rule #3)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 08, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"リスクを背負いすぎても、背負わなさすぎてもいけない（ボーグルヘッズの哲学-ルール#3）","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"永远不要承担过多或过少的风险（Bogleheads哲学--规则3）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"永遠不要承擔過多或過少的風險（Bogleheads哲學--規則3）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qpe2gt","previousId":"RedditPost-qpbopa","nextId":"RedditPost-qp3kz4","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qpe2gt/imo_the_market_is_strongly_underestimating_the/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
