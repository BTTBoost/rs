Weeks where it would lose half. I didn’t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. </p>\n\n<p>I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I’m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it’s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin’s mistake? No actual hedging. Don’t be a Melvin. . </p>\n\n<p>A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won’t help if you’re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I’ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. </p>\n\n<p>But I don’t give a fuck. </p>\n\n<p>Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren’t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we’re in dire straits probably didn’t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the “Golly I could’ve had Apple 20 years ago!” guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbdi8m/message_from_a_tsla_veteran_shut_the_fuck_up_and/","title":"Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and hold","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T10:27:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 10:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"585640f9-21fe-5cf7-8953-a6833660568a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbdi8m/message_from_a_tsla_veteran_shut_the_fuck_up_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbdi8m/message_from_a_tsla_veteran_shut_the_fuck_up_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"misterYOLOdolo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/misterYOLOdolo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"misterYOLOdolo","score":59958,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"一个TSLA老兵的消息。闭上你的鸟嘴","the_new_excerpt":"现在其他的评论都是在感叹大家的愚蠢，都是骗子。\n谁还在坚持或如何悲伤它是大个子再次赢得或其他一些阴暗的。\n胡说八道\n\n对于所有在那里的人谁曾经想过 \"哦，伙计，如果我买了\nX股X年前我就发财了！\" - 如果你不...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個TSLA老兵的消息。閉上你的鳥嘴","the_new_excerpt":"現在其他的評論都是在感嘆大家的愚蠢，都是騙子。\n誰還在堅持或如何悲傷它是大個子再次贏得或其他一些陰暗的。\n胡說八道\n\n對於所有在那裏的人誰曾經想過 \"哦，夥計，如果我買了\nX股X年前我就發財了！\" - 如果你不...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-34e5f8f2-3b84-5a91-a7a1-f9088988dcbb","excerpt":"Just by reading the title you know what this is about.
