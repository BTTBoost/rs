He asked what I think of the stock. Ive been watching stock and feel its above fair value for me but for him is a screaming deal. Led me to research companies Ive worked at a holding of.</p>\n\n<p>The ones that trade publicly are:</p>\n\n<p>YUM brands: YUM</p>\n\n<p>would not buy on open market, believe it will do well but not outperform. Id be happy to buy discounted shares however. </p>\n\n<p>Albertsons: ACI</p>\n\n<p>financials seem terrible, no room for real growth with pretty robust competition. Avoid.</p>\n\n<p>Modivcare Inc: MODV</p>\n\n<p>Stock price running real hot and enjoying a covid high, will probably correct hard. Medical transportation and logistics has been huge with covid but will soon be back to normal and they cant maintain the growth, with a PE of 66 im scared plus so much revenue is based on government contracts  I&#39;m avoiding.</p>\n\n<p>WalMart: WMT</p>\n\n<p>Not going to outperform, never going away. Would buy at discount, wont buy open market.</p>\n\n<p>Dick&#39;s:  DKS</p>\n\n<p>their financials seem really good. I dont know how but they are crushing it. The ones local to me dont seem to do much business. But revenue, profits, doing great. Buying back shares to increase stock value and even paying a dividend for icing on the cake. Im contemplating buying some open market after some more DD as this one confuses me and will jump on a discounted share in a heartbeat, which almost pains me to say since that was my least favorite place to work ever.</p>\n\n<p>My current employer is the federal government so their stock is pretty much a bond and those arte pretty lame. Where have you worked you would hold stock in? Do you currently work somewhere where you would be confortable buying stock in the company?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/orhjwq/redditors_who_work_at_publicly_traded_companies/","title":"Redditors who work at publicly traded companies, would you buy stock in your company?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-25T21:54:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-25 21:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9879aef3-481d-5fbb-8bbe-068cd9701810","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/orhjwq/redditors_who_work_at_publicly_traded_companies/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/orhjwq/redditors_who_work_at_publicly_traded_companies/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Forgotwhyimhere69","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Forgotwhyimhere69","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Forgotwhyimhere69","score":1032,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"上場企業で働いているレディターの皆さん、あなたは自分の会社の株を買いますか？","the_new_excerpt":"廃棄物処理会社で働いている友人は、従業員の株式購入プログラムを勧められました。\n制度があり、割引価格で株を購入することができます。彼は私に、この株についてどう思うかと尋ねました。\nと聞かれました。私は株価を見ていて、私にとっては適正価格を超えていると感じていますが、彼にとっては絶望的な取引です。\n私にとっては適正価格を超えていると感じていますが、彼にとっては非常に魅力的な取引です。私が働いたことのある会社を調べてみたところ...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在上市公司工作的Redditors，你会买你公司的股票吗？","the_new_excerpt":"一个在废物管理部门工作的朋友得到了一个员工股票购买计划，他们以折扣价获得股票。\n在那里他们可以以折扣价获得股票。他问我对这一计划有何看法。\n股票。我一直在观察股票，觉得它对我来说高于公平价值，但对他来说\n是一个令人震惊的交易。他让我去研究我曾经工作过的公司。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在上市公司工作的Redditors，你會買你公司的股票嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"一個在廢物管理部門工作的朋友得到了一個員工股票購買計劃，他們以折扣價獲得股票。\n在那裏他們可以以折扣價獲得股票。他問我對這一計劃有何看法。\n股票。我一直在觀察股票，覺得它對我來說高於公平價值，但對他來說\n是一個令人震驚的交易。他讓我去研究我曾經工作過的公司。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-3ae7ef00-2c1c-588a-b30c-b99c52957b03","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oren1i/i_had_a_lucid_dream_that_i_would_be_a_millionaire/","title":"I had a LUCID Dream that I would be a millionaire - LCID YOLO 50K","date":"July 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"億万長者になるというLUCIDの夢を持っていた - LCID YOLO 50K","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我有一个LUCID梦，我将成为一个百万富翁 - LCID YOLO 50K","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我有一個LUCID夢，我將成爲一個百萬富翁 - LCID YOLO 50K","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-9f105af3-e601-5ded-a474-6bde823d6c9e","excerpt":"A close relative has recently passed away and left me a sizeable inheritance\nthat is in the process of being disbursed.
