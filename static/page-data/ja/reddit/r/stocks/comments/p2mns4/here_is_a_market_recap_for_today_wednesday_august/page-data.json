It was not fun :(</em></p>\n\n<p>Despite some choppiness in the early morning, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) continued their run of strength, once again powering to record highs driven by strength in industrial and financial stocks. Relative to these two indexes, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) has recently been underperforming, a sign that we may be at the beginning of a rotation away from tech-stocks, which had recently been driving the market higher. Market participants are encouraged by the Senate passing a new $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a new in-line inflationary report.</p>\n\n<p>Shockingly, we actually have some good news coming out of Congress. The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, “This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you’ve been asking for for a long, long time.” Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared “100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration” said of the deal, “I was proud to support today’s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.” The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/</a></p>\n\n<p>The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June’s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.</p>\n\n<p>Core CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June’s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June’s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it’s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Elon Musk’s jet landed in Germany, according to public flight data, as Tesla faces delays in trying to bring the “gigafactory” in Berlin up to speed.</li>\n<li>A bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc&#39;s Google.</li>\n<li>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar, both Democrats, teamed up with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn to sponsor the bill, which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system. This is probably not going anywhere.</li>\n<li>After a massive run of outperformance, chipmakers have lost some steam following a report that order-filling time has skyrocketed to 20-weeks, the most in the four years, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. We’ve all seen the headlines about the chip shortage, this should come as no surprise. I see no reason why the issues would not be resolved moving forward.</li>\n<li>Ford Motors (F) announced it was extending its partnership with battery maker SK Innovation for production of EV batteries beyond North America and into Europe.
