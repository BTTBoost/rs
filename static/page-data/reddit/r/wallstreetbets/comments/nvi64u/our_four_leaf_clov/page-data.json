A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you, crayon eaters.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes 🦍. We collectively are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon-eating apes who are eager to eat some tasty bananas 🍌. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions 💬 in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The main topic and example today is $CLOV.</strong> You&#39;ve most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four-leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tenders (currency).</p>\n\n<p>$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They &#39;borrow&#39; the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here&#39;s the catch. If they &#39;borrow&#39; the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good. Now, what causes the short squeeze?</strong> Truth is many factors. WSB as a whole usually rally around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and in turn, causes the stock to go up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the perfect recipe?</strong> Well, because it&#39;s so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they&#39;ve bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four-leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will &#39;exercise&#39; their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the &#39;strike&#39; price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it too late to purchase $CLOV?</strong> No, it&#39;s not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those bananas back to us at a higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isn&#39;t as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually are a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll profit if you hold. What you&#39;re seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What will the price hit? When do I sell?</strong> Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem. The stonk market is a scary place. There is always a risk, but this risk, for now, is limited.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did I miss out? Should I buy it now?</strong> It&#39;s up to you, I&#39;m not s financial advisor. Personally, I&#39;m doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.</p>\n\n<p>To all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I&#39;m telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Apes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best of luck. 🍀 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. 👍</p>\n\n<p>AMA 🗣️</p>\n\n<p>Edit: On June 18th many options contracts expire. So expect tons of movement in the coming days in an upward trend. Expect price drops a day or two before June 18th as paper hands try and exit. Don&#39;t fret, it will go back up. 🎢 Also, NO SHORTS HAVE COVERED THEIR POSITIONS YET. This means this hasn&#39;t even begun yet. The next few days will be interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: To all the people saying I work at a hedge fund, I&#39;d like to apologize to you and just say that is the funniest thing I&#39;ve read all day. Didn&#39;t realize how many conspiracy theorists there were here! </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvi64u/our_four_leaf_clov/","title":"Our Four Leaf $CLOV 🍀","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"June 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-09T10:31:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-09 10:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"82f8d522-70df-5e96-9ce4-1bd7be226061","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvi64u/our_four_leaf_clov/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvi64u/our_four_leaf_clov/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"Zewdle","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zewdle","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Zewdle","score":1389,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私たちの四つ葉 $CLOV 🍀の","the_new_excerpt":"親愛なる猿たちへ、今日はあなたにいくつかのことを伝えるために手紙を書いています。多くの人が\n理解していない人や理解したいと思っている人 誤った情報を流している人が多いことなど。\n誤解を解き、クレヨンを食べる皆さんにお知らせしたいと思います。\n\nWSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit、エイプの家へようこそ 🦍。私たちは\nまとめて...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们的四片叶子$CLOV 🍀","the_new_excerpt":"亲爱的猿人，我今天给你写信是想告诉你几件事。我看到很多人\n不理解和想理解。很多人在传播错误的信息，等等。\n我想清除空气并告知你们，吃蜡笔的人。\n\n欢迎来到WSB（华尔街博彩）Reddit，猿人🦍的家。我们\n集体...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們的四片葉子$CLOV 🍀","the_new_excerpt":"親愛的猿人，我今天給你寫信是想告訴你幾件事。我看到很多人\n不理解和想理解。很多人在傳播錯誤的信息，等等。\n我想清除空氣並告知你們，喫蠟筆的人。\n\n歡迎來到WSB（華爾街博彩）Reddit，猿人🦍的家。我們\n集體...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-b3087539-9e08-59b0-a4de-87412f37a59f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvg0fv/you_all_saved_my_ass_with_clov_wish_and_clne_made/","title":"You all saved my ass with $CLOV, $WISH and $CLNE, made $24k today.","date":"June 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"あなた方は、$CLOV、$WISH、$CLNEで私のケツを救ってくれました、今日は$24kを儲けました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"你们都用$CLOV、$WISH和$CLNE救了我的命，今天赚了24000美元。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們都用$CLOV、$WISH和$CLNE救了我的命，今天賺了24000美元。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c49eb739-6b2a-5744-a3e3-bcd021f713d1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvkte2/amc_to_the_moon/","title":"AMC TO THE MOON! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 09, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"amc to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"跃上月球的AMC! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"躍上月球的AMC! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-82f8d522-70df-5e96-9ce4-1bd7be226061","previousId":"RedditPost-b3087539-9e08-59b0-a4de-87412f37a59f","nextId":"RedditPost-c49eb739-6b2a-5744-a3e3-bcd021f713d1","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvi64u/our_four_leaf_clov/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
