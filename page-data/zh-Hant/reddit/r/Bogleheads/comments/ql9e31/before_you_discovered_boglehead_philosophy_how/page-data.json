Ever. I wasn&#39;t encouraged to invest, I was never taught the value of investing, my parents never discussed investing in front of me... absolutely no interest in investing was ever on display. Not only did this inform my approach to investing, it also informed my approach to people with wealth (which neither of my parents were). It never occurred to me that patiently investing for decades—specifically in low-cost index funds—was a path to becoming wealthy. That that was an option for me. We just regarded wealthy individuals with an unspoken &quot;Good for them, but that&#39;s not happening for us.&quot; We approached investing as something we mutually agreed was beyond our understanding. There are people who can make investing work for them, and then there are people who cannot, and we were those who could not, and that was that. </p>\n\n<p>I personally thought this way a lot longer than I should have, and I know I&#39;m far from alone in committing that error. I&#39;m a Boglehead now, but I wanted to understand the major underlying reason why I wasn&#39;t before, and why many people are not. I speak for myself here, but I think this might be true of other people: <strong>I did not actively want to consider the idea that my freedom was something I had to buy, and I did not want to actively conceive of myself as someone who isn&#39;t free.</strong> Because if I do that, that means I have to look at myself as someone who is not free, and I have to look at the myriad of ways that I&#39;m not free. I realize it was emotionally easier to delude myself into the idea that I am free as an excuse to look away from the reality that I am not free, and that becoming free is going to take patience, time, and unwavering commitment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Boglehead philosophy is invaluable to me because it&#39;s the first time I was encouraged to think about the future value of money, and it&#39;s focused on being able to buy the most important thing: my freedom.</strong> Once I grasped that, everything else fell into place for me emotionally, and I don&#39;t fall for many of the traps that I used to.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I&#39;ve seen the question posed: how do you emotionally handle the idea of the stock market dropping tomorrow and watching your net worth drop? That&#39;s easy: I remind myself that I&#39;m not investing for tomorrow. I&#39;m investing for a 30-40 year horizon. Therefore, regardless of what the stock market does tomorrow, the best time to buy low-cost index funds to provide for my future is still now.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, my questions for you all: before you were a Boglehead, how did you used to think about money? Did your parents encourage you to see the value in investing, or is that something you had to learn on your own? Did you used to have a toxic relationship with money? If so, how?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ql9e31/before_you_discovered_boglehead_philosophy_how/","title":"Before you discovered Boglehead philosophy, how did you used to think about money?","tags":["Bogleheads","reddit"],"date":"November 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-02T19:20:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-02 19:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ql9e31","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ql9e31/before_you_discovered_boglehead_philosophy_how/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ql9e31/before_you_discovered_boglehead_philosophy_how/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Bogleheads","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads","author":"_EthanGrey","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/_EthanGrey","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"_EthanGrey","score":154,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ボーグルヘッドの哲学に出会う前は、お金についてどのように考えていましたか？","the_new_excerpt":"ボーグルヘッドになる前の自分のお金に対する考え方を思い出してみると\n振り返ってみると、今の私にはいかにも異質なものに思えます。\n\n私が育った家庭では、投資について語られることはありませんでした。一度もです。投資を勧められることも\n投資を勧められることもなく、投資の価値を教えてもらうこともなく、両親も...\n私の両親は決して...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在你发现Boglehead哲学之前，你以前是如何看待金钱的？","the_new_excerpt":"我还记得在成为Boglehead之前，我是如何思考金钱问题的。\n现在回想起来，我发现它对我来说是多么的陌生。\n\n所以我是在一个从未谈论过投资的家庭中长大的。从来没有。我没有被\n我没有被鼓励去投资，我从来没有被教导过投资的价值，我的父母\n从未...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在你發現Boglehead哲學之前，你以前是如何看待金錢的？","the_new_excerpt":"我還記得在成爲Boglehead之前，我是如何思考金錢問題的。\n現在回想起來，我發現它對我來說是多麼的陌生。\n\n所以我是在一個從未談論過投資的家庭中長大的。從來沒有。我沒有被\n我沒有被鼓勵去投資，我從來沒有被教導過投資的價值，我的父母\n從未...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qkqj8x","excerpt":"The stock has clearly took off, but part of me thinks a lot of this has to do\nwith it's MEME potential, as well as obviously the EV sector on a phenomenal run\nin the last month or so.\n\nThere's plenty to like with this, but I struggle looking at which stock is more\noverpriced currently: This or…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qkqj8x/where_do_we_realistically_see_tsla_going_next/","title":"Where do we realistically see TSLA going next?","date":"November 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"TSLAの今後の方向性は？","the_new_excerpt":"株価は明らかに上昇していますが、私の一部は、その多くがMEMEの可能性に関係していると考えています。\nMEMEの可能性に加えて、ここ1ヶ月ほどEV部門が驚異的な成長を遂げていることも関係していると思います。\nこの1ヶ月ほどの間に、電気自動車部門が驚異的な成長を遂げました。\n\n気に入った点はたくさんありますが、現在、どちらの銘柄がより割高かという点については悩んでいます。\n現在、どちらの株が割高なのか悩んでいます。これと...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们现实地看到TSLA的下一步发展方向是什么？","the_new_excerpt":"该股显然已经起飞了，但我认为这很大程度上与它的MEME潜力有关。\n它的MEME潜力，以及显然电动车行业在上个月的惊人表现\n在过去一个月左右的时间里。\n\n这有很多值得喜欢的地方，但我很难看出哪只股票更有价值。\n目前价格过高。这个或...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們現實地看到TSLA的下一步發展方向是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"該股顯然已經起飛了，但我認爲這很大程度上與它的MEME潛力有關。\n它的MEME潛力，以及顯然電動車行業在上個月的驚人表現\n在過去一個月左右的時間裏。\n\n這有很多值得喜歡的地方，但我很難看出哪隻股票更有價值。\n目前價格過高。這個或...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qlabwu","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlabwu/zuck_likes_to_cook_addictive_stuff/","title":"Zuck likes to cook addictive stuff..","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 02, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Zuckは料理が好きで、中毒性のあるものを作ります。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"祖克喜欢烹饪令人上瘾的东西。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"祖克喜歡烹飪令人上癮的東西。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ql9e31","previousId":"RedditPost-qkqj8x","nextId":"RedditPost-qlabwu","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/ql9e31/before_you_discovered_boglehead_philosophy_how/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
