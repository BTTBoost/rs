Well I&#39;ve got news for you: I&#39;ve been watching $OPAD like a hawk and it looks to be ramping up into the exact same situation as IRNT, and yet somehow you apes haven&#39;t realized this yet. If you&#39;re sad you missed out on IRNT and you think underwater mining is bullshit, then have I got the play for you. And you can actually seemingly get in early on this one too. I&#39;ve been accumulating my position in OPAD since last Tuesday while watching the gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential increase every day. Read on for what I know, and buckle up cause this is a big one…</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0z9j53b2bon71.png?width=1659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0f1c45bdd00818c3f61abc3640cd686efde050\">OPAD is where IRNT was two weeks ago</a></p>\n\n<p><em>This is not financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Please keep in mind this is a high risk play and I am a random stranger on the internet - so make sure you do your own research! Don&#39;t blame me if you&#39;re a dumbass who YOLOs their whole account into 150% OTM 3 DTE calls and this doesn&#39;t materialize.</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Background</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>First, some background on the company. Offerpad ($OPAD) is an iBuyer company with a current market cap of 2.636B.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797\">https://preview.redd.it/6wxq4xw4bon71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3beaf0d4855963388afc86057c8f74523ca2c797</a></p>\n\n<p>An iBuyer is basically a company that uses their technology to make quick offers to home sellers, then re-sell those homes themselves for profit. Think Redfin, Zillow, Opendoor - those are OPAD&#39;s competitors.</p>\n\n<p>Offerpad de-SPACed just a few weeks ago and started trading as OPAD on September 2. For some reason investors fucking hated this thing, so prior to the ticker change the SPAC had a huge percent of redemptions just like IRNT - a whopping 92% redemption rate. As a result, there are now only 3,387,913 shares in the free float until PIPE unlocks (TBD at this point). And, just like IRNT, OPAD has fallen into this retarded loophole created by the genius SEC where it somehow has options even though the current float is technically too small for listing options.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1vjw8d48bon71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75752ce6d62b95ac0731442ef2fdb5da9c49580b\">Redemption info from OPAD&#39;s super 8K filing - a legal filing our SEC overlords make each SPAC file when it completes its merger and de-SPACs</a></p>\n\n<p>As a result of the low float the stock has been extremely volatile since it began trading as OPAD on 9/2. It&#39;s seen 10-20% intraday swings pretty much every day since the ticker change. If you had just been trading those dips you&#39;d actually probably be pretty fucking rich by now. OPAD even reached a high of $16 last Thursday. Just as it was starting to gamma squeeze into orbit, though, it was shorted to shit Thursday into Friday and eventually closed Friday down almost 40% from that $16 high. More on that shorting below - point is, this is super volatile and therefore also a high risk play. If that&#39;s too scary for you, though, then why the fuck are you on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/WSB/\">r/WSB</a> in the first place? Go back to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/\">r/investing</a> and your 3 fund portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you&#39;re a smooth brain who obsesses over technical analysis - OPAD looks to have had a nearly perfect gap fill Monday and has since started to take off into orbit (up 29% from that low end of day Tuesday).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qheyfjjdbon71.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b58b811614984f2013a2cdfb05a2259e7195d04\">https://preview.redd.it/qheyfjjdbon71.png?width=1669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b58b811614984f2013a2cdfb05a2259e7195d04</a></p>\n\n<p>Closed 9/3 at $8.63 and gapped up to open 9/7 at $10.09. On 9/3 retraced back down to $8.60 for all of one minute before bouncing back up.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Gamma Squeeze - Market Makers Fucked</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Alright, now to the really good stuff. I know as soon as you read &quot;gamma squeeze&quot; in the title your itty bitty micropeen got hard as a thumbtack, so let me give you some porn to jack off to.</p>\n\n<p>Just like IRNT, OPAD&#39;s options can put market makers in the position where they would need to buy over 100% of OPAD&#39;s current float in order to hedge their risk from writing options to retards like you all on WSB - and frankly, it&#39;s not that hard for OPAD to reach the point where this would happen. As further OTM call options become in the money, market makers will have to buy more and more of these shares to sell to you if you decide to exercise the contract. This is because of the options Greeks Delta and Gamma. Now normally I know that for you retards &quot;options Greeks&quot; usually means the options your wife&#39;s Greek boyfriend tells you to buy, but for this play Delta and Gamma are super important.</p>\n\n<p>Since I know you dgaf about options Greeks, let me try to dumb it down for you apes with a picture:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb\">https://preview.redd.it/2pluvjwjbon71.png?width=1747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892bf16fa9e8a9325c69b8808fbad066e460a6bb</a></p>\n\n<p>Based on the options open interest as of yesterday, if OPAD reached $16 then market makers would need to hedge 98.21% of the current float. At Wednesday&#39;s close price, only 29.72% of the float would need to be hedged - still a huge amount, but clearly this thing has room to run. And on top of that, OPAD already managed to reach $16 last Thursday before it was swatted down by short sellers.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, as the price increases past $16 market makers would need to buy less and less additional stock to hedge since the stock price becomes further and further from the open options interest. If more people buy more OTM options, though, then the price could run even higher because market makers would need to buy even more stock even after the price runs (aka the situation IRNT is in right now). This is delta and gamma at play, and what can create a gamma squeeze. This covering would be incredibly difficult for market makers to do because of the low number of stock available in the float. OPAD already briefly reached $16 last Thursday and OPAD&#39;s options volume and open interest has been steadily increasing, so who knows what the fuck could happen over the next few days as we head into September options expiration.</p>\n\n<p>Also, since you&#39;re a degenerate and have likely already started to buy options on this shit before even finishing my DD you may have noticed that OPAD&#39;s options open interest and volume is much lower than IRNT&#39;s. For one, this is probably because you apes haven&#39;t caught wind of OPAD until right now and haven&#39;t yet started buying large amounts of retardedly OTM calls. However, even with the lower overall open interest there is still a ton of potential.</p>\n\n<p>Here is OPAD&#39;s total open interest and volume since I started tracking it last week:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8\">https://preview.redd.it/3ahxfhvmbon71.png?width=524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=592b7835a2304db6ab812fdccfd9fb680b477ab8</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791\">https://preview.redd.it/puvnpdmobon71.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e5d576a1ba05856cbe93449daa6b8c72cae3791</a></p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s OPAD&#39;s OI and most recent volume for September expiration compared to IRNT, as of the end of the day Wednesday:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">OPAD</th>\n<th align=\"left\">IRNT</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Puts - OI</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3,326</td>\n<td align=\"left\">25,276</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Calls - OI</td>\n<td align=\"left\">19,369</td>\n<td align=\"left\">58,031</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Put-Call Ratio - OI</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.17</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.44</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Puts - Volume</td>\n<td align=\"left\">1,605</td>\n<td align=\"left\">9,719</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Calls - Volume</td>\n<td align=\"left\">16,205</td>\n<td align=\"left\">41,787</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Put-Call Ratio - Volume</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.10</td>\n<td align=\"left\">0.23</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p>While the total number of calls (for all strikes and for September) is lower than IRNT, there are pretty much no puts open for OPAD whereas IRNT has almost half as many open puts as calls. Puts that market makers sell counteract the hedging that market makers need to do when price increases in order to cover the calls they sell, so for OPAD a much lower relative number of puts means that the open calls could still require market makers to hedge a large volume of shares even if there are less total calls than IRNT. To dumb it down for you apes - less put mean slightly less call still go big boom.</p>\n\n<p>And all of this isn&#39;t even accounting for you dumbass apes who love short-dated OTM options. Just like GME, stock buying is what can really get this going. But, more options open interest means that the gamma squeeze potential will only increase.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Short Interest - Short Sellers Fucked</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977\">https://preview.redd.it/y56rygbybon71.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb999d9ecbf55fe076aae8dbf20f5f8cc49a7977</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jck8gau0con71.png?width=460&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc05bf4a5ebb91d0c4ceba8067c56f69ad856da5\">I know short squeezes are like crack to you people, and I&#39;m here to feed your addiction.</a></p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, ever since OPAD started to run last week it&#39;s been getting hammered by short sellers. To begin with, even taking out the gamma squeeze considerations with OPAD it&#39;s a retarded idea to short this stock right now. OPAD is a legitimate growth stock with many signs that it&#39;s significantly undervalued right now and could likely be a nice return even if you were to just buy and hold. For example, OPAD&#39;s 2021 projected revenue is $1.7-$1.85 billion. With their current market cap, they would only be trading at a 1.55 multiple; OPAD&#39;s peers are trading at multiple times higher than that. Even if all outstanding warrants are executed and after PIPE unlock, this stock will still be undervalued relative to its peers.</p>\n\n<p>The crazy thing about the shorting is that according to Ortex, short sellers have now managed to accumulate a total short interest of 5.33 million - which is <strong>157% of the current float</strong>. Short interest <strong>increased 36% yesterday</strong>, cost to borrow reached as high as <strong>220.08%</strong>, and <strong>utilization is at 99.98%</strong> (aka there are pretty much no shares left to short).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634\">https://preview.redd.it/btsivxm2con71.png?width=439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684fd041c0a8b15af0761fed6ed835d88b9a1634</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211\">https://preview.redd.it/0fvtcdr3con71.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1948a30365647cadf2459096e789bbe99c1c211</a></p>\n\n<p>Short sellers would already need to purchase 1.5x the current float to fully cover their positions. However - remember what I said earlier about the market makers needing to buy stocks to cover the calls they&#39;re writing to you retards? Because the market makers are doing that, there would be even less shares for short sellers to cover with. This is how you get to infinity squeeze potential - there just wouldn&#39;t be nearly enough shares available for everyone to buy what they need to cover. This gamma squeeze/short squeeze potential is also exactly what happened with GME back in January. It&#39;s almost like these dumbass short sellers haven&#39;t learned a damn thing.</p>\n\n<p>It also seems that these short sellers caught on to this risk and really don&#39;t want this thing to blast off. And I take offense to that - I want my tendies. These huge drops in price were rally killers. If you check the open interest from Ortex above you&#39;ll see the huge increase in short interest after last Thursday.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mr2cfuu4con71.png?width=1666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=359769d5f4676a797ecff357c00ad0f47fe90927\">Shorts fucking with OPAD when it started to take off last Thursday</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dpsq83p5con71.png?width=1670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f80e9a93511d65bb9c10f457249823e70a8b07\">Shorts fucking with OPAD again when it started to take off Wednesday</a></p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s great is that even though this has been significantly beaten down by short sellers, OPAD has come right back after each dip you see above. This thing just cannot be beaten.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483\">https://preview.redd.it/eht6wkq7con71.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=570e9c1bd82e51863c34106b5666d0e8fa91e483</a></p>\n\n<p>More importantly, though, is that since these short sellers seem to just keep doubling down each time this thing starts to blast off they will be extra mega-fucked once it actually does achieve liftoff. Each time they double down on their shorting they are just adding more fuel to the fire. More than that, if the folks shorting OPAD are the same ones shorting other low float stocks like IRNT, and OPAD pops alongside those other stocks - we very well could see short sellers getting margin called from multiple positions turning extremely against them all at once just like we saw back in January/February with GME, AMC, etc.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547\">https://preview.redd.it/c4s8y6k8con71.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572dfc1c1e7a6baf03e1fe610864b755ce7b8547</a></p>\n\n<p>So, there you have it--yet another gamma squeeze/short squeeze stock for you to go apeshit over.
