From the above article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We find that firms with exposure to any of these major havens lost roughly $230 billion in market capitalization. The economic magnitude is rather stunning. It’s along the lines of $200 million per firm on average. However, all of these are large firms, so this reflects roughly 0.5% of market capitalization of these firms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t quite remember the political climate in 2016. But I&#39;m interested to hear if people think that this is a bad time for the market to get this kind of news, or if this is really a drop in the bucket with everything going on, or if you don&#39;t think it will really impact the market that significantly. It looks like this article was based on a paper released less than a month after the Panama papers were released, so I&#39;m fairly certain investors reacted quickly to the news.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s your take? I&#39;m fairly new to this stuff but my game has been taking geopolitical events and trying to understand their impacts on the markets.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q0ni84/possible_effects_from_pandora_leaks/","title":"Possible Effects from Pandora Leaks?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-03T20:00:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-03 20:00","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q0ni84","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q0ni84/possible_effects_from_pandora_leaks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q0ni84/possible_effects_from_pandora_leaks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"enfjaril","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/enfjaril","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"enfjaril","score":75,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"パンドラのリークによる影響の可能性？","the_new_excerpt":"パンドラ・ペーパー\n[https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/alcogal-panama-latin-america-politicians/]をご覧ください。\n本日発表された「パンドラ文書」は、多くの国の指導者や米国の州（サウスダコタ州）がオフショア会計事務所を利用していることを告発するものです。\nアメリカのサウスダコタ州）が、海外の会計事務所を利用して、税金逃れや資金隠し、資金洗浄を行っていることを告発しました。\nロンダリングを行っていることを告発しています。\n\nその中で...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"潘多拉泄密可能产生的影响？","the_new_excerpt":"潘多拉文件\n[https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/alcogal-panama-latin-america-politicians/]\n今天出炉，指责许多国家的领导人以及甚至美国的一个州（南达科他州）利用离岸会计避风港来逃税或隐藏资金。\n南达科他州）利用离岸会计避风港来逃税、隐瞒资金或\n洗钱。\n\n其中...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"潘多拉泄密可能產生的影響？","the_new_excerpt":"潘多拉文件\n[https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/alcogal-panama-latin-america-politicians/]\n今天出爐，指責許多國家的領導人以及甚至美國的一個州（南達科他州）利用離岸會計避風港來逃稅或隱藏資金。\n南達科他州）利用離岸會計避風港來逃稅、隱瞞資金或\n洗錢。\n\n其中...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q04qbf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q04qbf/255k_gme_yolo/","title":"255k $GME YOLO","date":"October 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"255k $GME YOLO","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"255k $GME YOLO","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"255k $GME YOLO","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q0j75t","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q0j75t/this_is_the_next_gme/","title":"“tHiS Is ThE NeXT GmE”","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 03, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"THHiS Is ThE NeXT GmE\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"这就是NeXT GmE\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"這就是NeXT GmE\"","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q0ni84","previousId":"RedditPost-q04qbf","nextId":"RedditPost-q0j75t","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q0ni84/possible_effects_from_pandora_leaks/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
