They&#39;re going up against Abbvie with a biosimilar for Humira called Yuflyma that was recently shown to be equivalent and should role out in Europe soon.  They&#39;ve also got a biosimilar for Remicade called Remsima (Inflectra in the USA) that&#39;s already on the market.  </p>\n\n<p>The news now is that Celltrion is partnering with 180 Life Sciences (ATNF) to supply drugs in 180&#39;s clinical trials.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/celltrion-healthcare-180-life-sciences-120000932.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/celltrion-healthcare-180-life-sciences-120000932.html</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>On the face of it, this is not that interesting.  But as an long-term 180 Life Sciences ($ATNF) bull, I assure you, it&#39;s very interesting.  The founders of ATNF are the guys that originally discovered Remicade and Humira.  They&#39;re carrying all sorts of trade-secrets around in their heads that could enhance Celltrion&#39;s biosimilars program as it accelerates into manufacturing in China.  On top of that, ATNF has a very attractive patent portfolio in its own right and is in the middle of running a handful of clinical trials.  Reading between the lines, this simple supply deal starts to smell a lot more like a potential merger, especially since ATNF&#39;s latest clinical trials will be using Celltrion&#39;s drugs.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Celltrion is traded on KSE (Korean Stock Exchange) and ATNF is traded on the Nasdaq.  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/psu0a8/celltrion_and_180_life_sciences/","title":"Celltrion and 180 Life Sciences","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-22T10:29:46.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-22 10:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"psu0a8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/psu0a8/celltrion_and_180_life_sciences/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/psu0a8/celltrion_and_180_life_sciences/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"RelationPure306","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RelationPure306","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"RelationPure306","score":59,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"セルトリオンと180ライフサイエンス","the_new_excerpt":"Celltrion社は時価総額320億円のバイオテック企業で、様々な分野のモノクローナル抗体を開発しています。\nCOVID-19（レグダンビマブ）をはじめとする様々な適応症のモノクローナル抗体を開発しています。\nCOVID-19（レグダンビマブ）をはじめ、RAやクローン病などの炎症性疾患の治療薬を開発しています。\nアッヴィに対抗して、ヒュミラのバイオシミラーである...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Celltrion和180生命科学公司","the_new_excerpt":"Celltrion是一家市值320亿美元的生物技术领先企业，为各种适应症开发单克隆\n适应症的单克隆抗体，包括COVID-19 (regdanvimab) 和\n包括COVID-19（regdanvimab）和其他炎症性疾病，如RA和Crohn's疾病的整个混乱。\n他们正在与艾伯维公司对抗，推出名为Humira的生物仿制药。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Celltrion和180生命科學公司","the_new_excerpt":"Celltrion是一家市值320億美元的生物技術領先企業，爲各種適應症開發單克隆\n適應症的單克隆抗體，包括COVID-19 (regdanvimab) 和\n包括COVID-19（regdanvimab）和其他炎症性疾病，如RA和Crohn's疾病的整個混亂。\n他們正在與艾伯維公司對抗，推出名爲Humira的生物仿製藥。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pswpr6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pswpr6/buy_the_dip/","title":"Buy the dip?","date":"September 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ディップを買う？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"买下这块地？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"買下這塊地？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-psyixc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/psyixc/yall_already_fuckin_know_which_one_im_picking/","title":"Y’all already fuckin know which one I’m picking","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 22, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私がどれを選ぶか、皆さんはもうお分かりでしょう。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"你们都他妈知道我选的是哪一个","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們都他媽知道我選的是哪一個","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-psu0a8","previousId":"RedditPost-pswpr6","nextId":"RedditPost-psyixc","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/psu0a8/celltrion_and_180_life_sciences/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
