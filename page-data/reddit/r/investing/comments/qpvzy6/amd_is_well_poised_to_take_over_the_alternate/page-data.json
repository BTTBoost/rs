I daresay these are just the starting points to the entrance to a whole new alternate universe.</p>\n\n<p>AMD has partnerships with Microsoft and Sony for gaming console chips and now has signed up Meta (Facebook) as a new customer. We all know what Facebook was planning when it changed name to Meta and AMD is going to benefit tremendously from this partnership.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s gradually taking away market share from Intel and soon we will reach a point where Intel might not even be a competitor to AMD. While the need for CPUs is here to stay, most future tech would be based on GPUs, a sector where AMD has a strong footing.</p>\n\n<p>Have a long position in AMD, bought at 115. Would buy more before it hits 200.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: adding a section to explain why GPUs would support future AI and VR tech more than CPUs.</p>\n\n<p>GPUs are better at performing mathematical and geometric calculations than CPUs. That&#39;s why they are crucial for AI/ML and VR.\nThis is also why GPUs are used intensively for crypto mining. \nCPUs are crucial for putting everything together and perform code and logic processing. That&#39;s why GPUs won&#39;t replace CPUs but as we move towards more complex requirements for altverse, we would need powerful CPUs but we would need much more advanced GPUs. For instance take high end pc games. High end games can run on a mid-end I5 CPU but need a high end GPU.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-gpu-and-do-you-need-one-in-deep-learning-718b9597aa0d\">https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-gpu-and-do-you-need-one-in-deep-learning-718b9597aa0d</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/qpvzy6/amd_is_well_poised_to_take_over_the_alternate/","title":"AMD is well poised to take over the alternate universe","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"November 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-10T03:21:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-10 03:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qpvzy6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qpvzy6/amd_is_well_poised_to_take_over_the_alternate/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qpvzy6/amd_is_well_poised_to_take_over_the_alternate/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"GazBB","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GazBB","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GazBB","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AMDはオルタナティブ・ユニバースを引き継ぐ準備が整っている","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/amd-shares-jump-after-company-wins-meta-partnership.html\n\nバーチャルリアリティ、オーグメンテッドリアリティ、メタバース。あえて言えば、これらは\n敢えて言えば、これらは全く新しい別世界への入り口への出発点に過ぎません。\n\nAMDはマイクロソフトやソニーとゲーム機で提携していますが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"AMD已经准备好接管另一个宇宙了","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/amd-shares-jump-after-company-wins-meta-partnership.html\n\n虚拟现实、增强现实和元空间。我敢说这些仅仅是\n通往一个全新的另类宇宙的起点。\n\nAMD与微软和索尼在游戏机方面有合作关系...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"AMD已經準備好接管另一個宇宙了","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/amd-shares-jump-after-company-wins-meta-partnership.html\n\n虛擬現實、增強現實和元空間。我敢說這些僅僅是\n通往一個全新的另類宇宙的起點。\n\nAMD與微軟和索尼在遊戲機方面有合作關係...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qqik5u","excerpt":"I auto invest $150 100% into VTI weekly, auto drip, I don’t even know how much I\nhave invested because I stoped checking on it.
