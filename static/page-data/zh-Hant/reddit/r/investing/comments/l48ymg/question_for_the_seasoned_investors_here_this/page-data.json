It&#39;s becoming unhealthy. Surely the old folks here that have seen some other types of markets can actually share some thoughs and experiences on this, because you can&#39;t deny that the last months have been CRAZY: everyone and their mom seems to be into stocks.</p>\n\n<p>You can try to justify this rally al you want with the M2 money supply charts, the hype around tech and the american patriotism, the &quot;new world order&quot; etc., but valuations just don&#39;t lie and THEY MATTER. Right? Do valuations matter? Because that is what I was taught, but everybody seems to have forgotten this. Everybody overlooks the fact that, during the last 150 years, stocks were more expensive than this only during the dot-com bubble.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, will things ever get back to normal? <strong>And don&#39;t misunderstand me</strong>: I don&#39;t mean that stocks prices need to plunge, I just mean that valuations need to, which is not necessarily the same. And if they do, and all of this goes bust, is this crazy new interest around stocks here to stay for good or will the majority of people move on once the dust has settled? Was the dot-com like this on a retail level?</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not talking about GME, that is clearly a once in a decade squeeze event ... I&#39;m talking about everything else</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l48ymg/question_for_the_seasoned_investors_here_this/","title":"Question for the seasoned investors here: this WILL go bust at some point, right?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T16:09:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 16:09","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"258de8e3-47ca-5105-9128-b9733f3f274c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l48ymg/question_for_the_seasoned_investors_here_this/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l48ymg/question_for_the_seasoned_investors_here_this/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"xmrptbx","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/xmrptbx","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"xmrptbx","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"在这里问一下经验丰富的投资者：这个会在某个时间点破产吧？","the_new_excerpt":"我进入这个游戏只有2-3年的时间，因为我很年轻，我变得\n越来越多的担心，因为每一个备忘录的股票是在这个竞价到平流层。\n疯牛的狂热。越来越不健康了。当然，这里的老人们有\n看到一些其他类型的市场其实可以分享一些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在這裏問一下經驗豐富的投資者：這個會在某個時間點破產吧？","the_new_excerpt":"我進入這個遊戲只有2-3年的時間，因爲我很年輕，我變得\n越來越多的擔心，因爲每一個備忘錄的股票是在這個競價到平流層。\n瘋牛的狂熱。越來越不健康了。當然，這裏的老人們有\n看到一些其他類型的市場其實可以分享一些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-450c89ea-6e95-50db-bd20-d7e97c28901f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4meah/took_my_dads_life_savings_and_yolod_into_bb_told/","title":"Took my dads life savings and Yolo’d into BB, told him It’s either retirement on a yacht or foodstamps for him","date":"January 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我把我爸爸一生的积蓄和Yolo'd进入BB，告诉他这是要么在游艇上退休或食品券为他。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我把我爸爸一生的積蓄和Yolo'd進入BB，告訴他這是要麼在遊艇上退休或食品券爲他。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-40974b98-aa81-5134-8567-3d8ab3c4ed72","excerpt":"Hello fellow astronauts,\n\nOn the eve of this great day, I think it's important to say that it's always\nbest to understate/undersell your winnings to friends and family.
