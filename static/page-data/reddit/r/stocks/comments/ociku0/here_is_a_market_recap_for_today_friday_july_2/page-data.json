The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. </p>\n\n<p>Today, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Change in non-farm payrolls:</strong> 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May</li>\n<li><strong>Unemployment rate:</strong> 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May </li>\n<li><strong>Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:</strong> 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May</li>\n<li><strong>Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:</strong> 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>President Biden said of the report, “This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.”</p>\n\n<p>Emily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, “This is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining – I wouldn&#39;t call them necessarily contained – but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We&#39;re making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they&#39;re going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold – this is just what the market wants.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a “string” of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp\">see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)</a>, it’s changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB&#39;s next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.</li>\n<li>More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. </li>\n<li>Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data<strong>,</strong> but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.&quot;</li>\n<li>Jeff Bezos is officially stepping down as Amazon CEO on Monday.
