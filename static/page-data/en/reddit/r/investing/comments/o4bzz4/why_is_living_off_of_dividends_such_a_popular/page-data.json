Why are so many people proponents of giving up the extra compund growth from reinvested dividends? </p>\n\n<p>I understand the appeal of having &quot;passive income&quot; but to me it seems like stealing money from your future self. Unless I have a gross concept error on what living off dividends really entails, I can&#39;t help but think people are too enamored with &quot;free money&quot; to consider the gains they are giving up as a consequence.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: My question stemmed from a concern that dividends were being portrayed as a form of passive income before retirement, I understand that once you are no longer working you have to have a way to continue to support yourself and your family. Nowadays there is so much hype about trying to find more ways to make money outside of your a job, and personally I think that while you&#39;re still working dividends should be considered passive investing (kind of like 401k matching) rather than passive &quot;income&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>So a better and slightly different question is, why do so many people like the idea of having 100% of living expenses covered by dividends? It almost seems like it contradicts the idea of having a diversified portfolio. Would it not be better to withdraw a set amount from a diversified portfolio rather than relying solely on dividends?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o4bzz4/why_is_living_off_of_dividends_such_a_popular/","title":"Why is living off of dividends such a popular concept?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-21T02:24:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-21 02:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0b6ca077-d755-5c48-b860-46aba4e59bf9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o4bzz4/why_is_living_off_of_dividends_such_a_popular/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o4bzz4/why_is_living_off_of_dividends_such_a_popular/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"OkPanda1337","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/OkPanda1337","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"OkPanda1337","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"なぜ、配当金生活が流行っているのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"私が見たところ、歴史的に見て、配当金を再投資することは、再投資しない場合に比べて、かなり大きなリターンにつながります。\n再投資しない場合に比べて、かなり大きなリターンを得ることができます。なぜ多くの人が\nなぜ多くの人が、配当金の再投資による余剰資金の成長を諦めることを支持するのでしょうか？\n\nパッシブ・インカム」の魅力は理解できますが、私には...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么依靠红利生活是一个如此流行的概念？","the_new_excerpt":"根据我的观察，从历史上看，将红利进行再投资会导致\n与不进行再投资相比，回报率明显更高。为什么有这么多的人\n支持放弃红利再投资带来的额外基金增长？\n\n我理解拥有 \"被动收入 \"的吸引力，但对我来说，这似乎...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼依靠紅利生活是一個如此流行的概念？","the_new_excerpt":"根據我的觀察，從歷史上看，將紅利進行再投資會導致\n與不進行再投資相比，回報率明顯更高。爲什麼有這麼多的人\n支持放棄紅利再投資帶來的額外基金增長？\n\n我理解擁有 \"被動收入 \"的吸引力，但對我來說，這似乎...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-bea99d35-0be0-5848-85af-65de3daec4e2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4e6xn/chad_money_episode_5/","title":"Chad Money: Episode 5","date":"June 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Chad Moneyです。エピソード5","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"乍得钱。第5集","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"乍得錢。第5集","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7a2e6dc0-0ebd-58df-b272-0e7d0a95ddb9","excerpt":"6/20/2021\n\nColleges have seen an increase in optional test taking. the test prep industry\nis increasing anyway. more than 1,500 accredited schools are taking steps to\nreduce test requirements to near zero by fall admissions 2022.\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/college-board-standardized-testing…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o4htgx/market_news_for_this_coming_week/","title":"market news for this coming week.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 21, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"来週のマーケットニュース","the_new_excerpt":"6/20/2021\n\n大学では選択式のテストを受ける人が増えています。\n1,500校以上の認定校が、テストの必要性を最小限に抑えるための措置を講じています。\n500以上の認定校が、2022年秋の入学試験までにテストをほぼゼロにするための措置をとっています。\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/college-board-standardized-testing...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"未来一周的市场新闻。","the_new_excerpt":"6/20/2021\n\n大学已经看到了可选考试的增加。\n1,500多所经认证的学校正在采取措施，以便\n到2022年秋季入学时将考试要求降至接近零。\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/college-board-standardized-testing...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"未來一週的市場新聞。","the_new_excerpt":"6/20/2021\n\n大學已經看到了可選考試的增加。\n1,500多所經認證的學校正在採取措施，以便\n到2022年秋季入學時將考試要求降至接近零。\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/college-board-standardized-testing...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-0b6ca077-d755-5c48-b860-46aba4e59bf9","previousId":"RedditPost-bea99d35-0be0-5848-85af-65de3daec4e2","nextId":"RedditPost-7a2e6dc0-0ebd-58df-b272-0e7d0a95ddb9","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o4bzz4/why_is_living_off_of_dividends_such_a_popular/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
