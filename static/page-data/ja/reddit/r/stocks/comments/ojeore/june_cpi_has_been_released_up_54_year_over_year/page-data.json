This was the largest 1-month change since June 2008 when the index rose 1.0 percent. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 5.4 percent before seasonal adjustment; this was the largest 12-month increase since a 5.4-percent increase for the period ending August 2008.  </p>\n\n<p>The index for used cars and trucks continued to rise sharply, increasing 10.5 percent in June. This increase accounted for more than one-third of the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index increased 0.8 percent in June, a larger increase than the 0.4-percent increase reported for May. The energy index increased 1.5 percent in June, with the gasoline index rising 2.5 percent over the month.  </p>\n\n<p>The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.9 percent in June after increasing 0.7 percent in May. Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, new vehicles, airline fares, and apparel. The index for medical care and the index for household furnishings and operations were among the few major component indexes which decreased in June.  </p>\n\n<p>The all items index rose 5.4 percent for the 12 months ending June; it has been trending up every month since January, when the 12-month change was 1.4 percent. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.5 percent over the last 12-months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1991. The energy index rose 24.5 percent over the last 12-months, and the food index increased 2.4 percent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ojeore/june_cpi_has_been_released_up_54_year_over_year/","title":"June CPI has been released - Up 5.4% year over year. 0.6% higher than the 4.8% expected","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-13T16:57:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-13 16:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"423f7574-4835-56ba-a2f9-d09553ad99cb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ojeore/june_cpi_has_been_released_up_54_year_over_year/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ojeore/june_cpi_has_been_released_up_54_year_over_year/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"foxtrot5","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/foxtrot5","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"foxtrot5","score":113,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"6月のCPIが発表されました - 前年同月比5.4％増。予想の4.8％を0.6％上回る","the_new_excerpt":"リンク [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_07132021.htm]\n\n> 都市部の消費者物価指数（CPI-U）は0.9％上昇しました。\n> 5月に0.6％上昇した後、6月には季節調整済みベースで0.9％上昇しました。\n> 米国労働統計局が本日発表した。これは、最大の1...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"6月CPI已经公布--同比增长5.4%。比预期的4.8%高0.6%。","the_new_excerpt":"链接 [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_07132021.htm]\n\n> 所有城市消费者的消费价格指数（CPI-U）上升了0.9%。\n> 经季节性调整后，6月份增长了0.9%，而5月份增长了0.6%。\n> 美国劳工统计局今天报告。这是最大的1...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"6月CPI已經公佈--同比增長5.4%。比預期的4.8%高0.6%。","the_new_excerpt":"鏈接 [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_07132021.htm]\n\n> 所有城市消費者的消費價格指數（CPI-U）上升了0.9%。\n> 經季節性調整後，6月份增長了0.9%，而5月份增長了0.6%。\n> 美國勞工統計局今天報告。這是最大的1...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1414958676356513804","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1414958676356513804","title":"https://t.co/2hJAZMplLD","date":"July 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"https://t.co/2hJAZMplLD","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"https://t.co/2hJAZMplLD","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"https://t.co/2hJAZMplLD","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-deb67307-322a-50cb-8c80-b203d1783400","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojfro2/bagholders_be_like/","title":"Bagholders be like...","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"July 13, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"バッグホルダーは、まるで...。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"袋子持有人就像...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"袋子持有人就像...","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-423f7574-4835-56ba-a2f9-d09553ad99cb","previousId":"TweetPost-1414958676356513804","nextId":"RedditPost-deb67307-322a-50cb-8c80-b203d1783400","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ojeore/june_cpi_has_been_released_up_54_year_over_year/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
