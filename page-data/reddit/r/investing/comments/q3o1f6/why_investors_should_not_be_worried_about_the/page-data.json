Most seem to think that an increase in M2 inevitably leads to inflation in prices of goods and services. This couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. There was previously a strong correlation between the two up until 1990. From then on, the correlation has reversed and is negative. There is now a much stronger relationship between increases in the money supply and decreases in the velocity of money, meaning that money is not moving through the economy as it once did. This means that increases in the money supply are not getting spent. And as we all know, money must be spent to cause inflation. This is why economists are not overly concerned about the recent rapid rise in the money supply causing inflation.</p>\n\n<p>So here are the four easy charts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=809733064&amp;format=image\">first chart</a> shows the correlation between the adjusted money supply and inflation. The M2 money supply is adjusted by subtracting real GDP. This amounts to the excess money beyond what is needed to grow real GDP. This has the strongest correlation with inflation. Inflation is measured by the implicit GDP price deflator, which measures the actual items that were spent in the year vs. a previous year&#39;s base price. You can use PCE or CPI, but the relationship is very similar. (Also I&#39;m using an 8 year moving average because this gives the strongest correlation between the two variables. The correlation is very weak in concurrent periods, and gets a little stronger using 2 and 4 year moving averages.) You can see from this chart that the correlation was very strong from 1968, the first year of the 8 year moving average, through the end of 1990. R = 0.95 and R^2 = 0.90. This indicates that 90% of changes in inflation can be explained by the changes in the adjusted money supply. This strong relationship has lead the general public to believe that the two variables are inherently related: That is, that the expansion of the adjusted money supply inevitably leads to inflation.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=2061624488&amp;format=image\">second chart</a> shows the correlation from 1991-2021. You can clearly see that the relationship reversed. R= -0.50 R^2 = 0.25. This indicates that the rate of inflation decreases as the adjusted money supply increases. It shows a moderate to weak relationship in which the increase in the adjusted money supply explains about 25% of the decrease in the rate of inflation. This can probably be explained by the fact that the money supply has seen its largest increases in periods when the economy was in recession and prices were falling. Needless to say, you can see that the former relationship between these two variables does NOT exist anymore and hasn&#39;t for 30 years!</li>\n<li>This <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=997615969&amp;format=image\">third chart</a> shows the relationship between changes in adjusted money supply and changes in the velocity of money from 1960-1990. The velocity of money is the frequency of monetary transactions in the economy. You can clearly see that the relationship is negative, as the adjusted money supply increases, the number of transactions decreases. R = -0.63 R^2 = 0.40. This indicates that 40% of the decrease in the velocity of money can be explained by the increase in the adjusted money supply. This is a moderately strong relationship.</li>\n<li>This <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=946401508&amp;format=image\">last chart</a> shows the correlation of adjusted money supply and the velocity of money from 1991-2021. R= -0.98 R^2 = 0.97. This indicates the strengthening of the relationship between increases in adjusted money supply and decreases in the velocity of money. You can clearly see that the more money that is pushed into the economy the less frequent that money gets spent.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>So where is all this money going if it is not going into goods and services?</strong> Economist largely believe that increases in the money supply probably inflate assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds and all other capital and financial assets. PE ratios have been on the rise for 30 years now. The average TTM PE ratio from 1928-1990 was 13.8 times. Since then it is 21x. The 10-year treasury yield from 1928-1990 averaged 5.17%. Since then 4.19%, and 3% in the last 20 years. The are further examples, but I think you can see that the decoupling of the money supply and inflation has probably benefited asset prices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Increasing the money supply does NOT lead to inflation in products and services like it once did. It now results in a lower velocity of money, more savings and higher asset prices.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q3o1f6/why_investors_should_not_be_worried_about_the/","title":"Why investors should not be worried about the expansion of the money supply causing inflation in four easy charts.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 08, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-08T13:04:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-08 13:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q3o1f6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q3o1f6/why_investors_should_not_be_worried_about_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q3o1f6/why_investors_should_not_be_worried_about_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"iKickdaBass","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/iKickdaBass","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"iKickdaBass","score":175,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投資家がマネーサプライの拡大によるインフレを心配する必要がない理由を、4つの簡単なチャートで説明しています。","the_new_excerpt":"はじめに 貨幣の増加については、様々な議論がなされています。\n貨幣供給量の増加とインフレーションについては多くの議論があります。多くの人は、M2が増加すれば必然的に財やサービスの価格が上昇すると考えているようです。\nインフレになると考えているようです。しかし、これは真実から大きく外れています。\nしかし、実際にはそうではありません。以前は、M2の上昇と物価の上昇には強い相関関係がありました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么投资者不应该担心货币供应量的扩张会导致通货膨胀，有四张简单的图表。","the_new_excerpt":"导言。关于货币供应量和通货膨胀的增加，已经有很多讨论。\n供应和通货膨胀。大多数人似乎认为，M2的增加不可避免地会导致\n导致商品和服务价格的通货膨胀。这与事实相差甚远。\n真相。以前，M2的增长与通货膨胀之间有很强的关联性。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼投資者不應該擔心貨幣供應量的擴張會導致通貨膨脹，有四張簡單的圖表。","the_new_excerpt":"導言。關於貨幣供應量和通貨膨脹的增加，已經有很多討論。\n供應和通貨膨脹。大多數人似乎認爲，M2的增加不可避免地會導致\n導致商品和服務價格的通貨膨脹。這與事實相差甚遠。\n真相。以前，M2的增長與通貨膨脹之間有很強的關聯性。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1446332837951590418","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1446332837951590418","title":"FINLAND JOINS SWEDEN AND DENMARK LIMITING SHOTS TO 30 YR OLD AND OVER DUE TO HEART INFLAMATION RISK SEEN IN YOUNGER ADULTS  - RTRS","date":"October 08, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"フィンランド、スウェーデン、デンマークに続き、若年層に見られる心臓の炎症のリスクを考慮し、30歳以上の人への注射を制限 - RTRS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"芬兰加入瑞典和丹麦的行列，限制30岁以上的人打针，因为年轻的成年人有心脏发炎的风险 - RTRS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"芬蘭加入瑞典和丹麥的行列，限制30歲以上的人打針，因爲年輕的成年人有心臟發炎的風險 - RTRS","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q3q2ci","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/q3q2ci/performance_chasers_beware_vanguard_projects/","title":"Performance chasers beware: Vanguard projects *negative* nominal (and real) returns for US large cap growth in ten-year model (stay the course, etc...)","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"October 08, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"パフォーマンスを追い求める人は要注意。バンガード社は10年モデルで米国大型株の名目（および実質）リターンをマイナスに予測（STAY THE COURCE, etc.","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"追求性能的人要注意了。Vanguard预测美国大盘股增长在十年模型中的名义（和实际）回报率为*负数（坚持到底，等等）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"追求性能的人要注意了。Vanguard預測美國大盤股增長在十年模型中的名義（和實際）回報率爲*負數（堅持到底，等等）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-q3o1f6","previousId":"TweetPost-1446332837951590418","nextId":"RedditPost-q3q2ci","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q3o1f6/why_investors_should_not_be_worried_about_the/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
