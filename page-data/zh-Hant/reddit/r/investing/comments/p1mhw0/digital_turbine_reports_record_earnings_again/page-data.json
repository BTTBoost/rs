(Nasdaq: APPS) announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30, 2021. All operating results discussed below, except as otherwise specifically noted, refer only to the continuing operations of the Company, and all comparisons to prior periods have been adjusted to reflect only continuing operations. The Company completed the acquisitions of AdColony Holdings AS and Fyber N.V. on April 29 and May 25, 2021, respectively. Therefore, the actual reported results discussed below, except as otherwise specifically noted, reflect only the partial contributions of those acquired businesses beginning on the dates the acquisitions closed. Specific references made to &quot;pro forma&quot; results in this release provide investors with quarterly results and comparisons as if all acquired businesses were owned for the entirety of the first quarters of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. The Company believes that pro forma results, where applicable, can provide investors with more relevant year-over-year comparisons. The reconciliations between the pro forma and GAAP financial results for the relevant periods are provided in the tables following the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recent Financial Highlights:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fiscal first quarter of 2022 revenue totaled $212.6 million. On a pro forma basis, as if both Fyber and AdColony were owned for the full quarter, total consolidated pro forma revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $292.0 million, representing a 104% increase year-over-year as compared to the comparable pro forma figure for the fiscal first quarter of 2021.</li>\n<li>GAAP net income for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $14.3 million, or $0.14 per share, as compared to GAAP net income of $9.9 million, or $0.11 per share for the fiscal first quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted net income1 for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $33.4 million, or $0.34 per share, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted net income of $12.5 million, or $0.13 per share, in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.</li>\n<li>Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA2 for the fiscal first quarter of 2022 was $39.8 million, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&quot;We are off to a fast start in fiscal 2022 with more than 100% year-over-year pro forma revenue growth and more than 150% year-over-year growth in both EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS,&quot; said Bill Stone, CEO. &quot;Not only did we continue to showcase the inherent operating leverage of our platform model with our strong bottom-line performance, but even more importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of full-stack, end-to-end platform capabilities that we believe strategically position the Company for continued prosperity well into the future. We are capitalizing on a unique opportunity to leverage our extensive on-device software presence and long-term partnerships with global carriers and OEMs to significantly expand our addressable app ecosystem market opportunity, and we are already witnessing a very positive initial reaction from advertisers all across the platform. We look forward to updating investors on the realized synergies for the Company and improved overall performance for app publishers and advertisers on the platform as fiscal 2022 progresses.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story continues</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/p1mhw0/digital_turbine_reports_record_earnings_again/","title":"Digital Turbine reports record earnings... again!","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-11T09:32:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-11 09:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"80a82e3f-a9b3-5f34-8ea4-a99762363068","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p1mhw0/digital_turbine_reports_record_earnings_again/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/p1mhw0/digital_turbine_reports_record_earnings_again/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"rawhide338","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rawhide338","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rawhide338","score":36,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"デジタル・タービン、過去最高の収益を記録...再び!","the_new_excerpt":"2021年8月9日(月)午後3時5分この記事の中で紹介しています。\n\n * アプリ [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APPS?p=APPS]-2.07%)\n\nFollowingAppsMy watchlistAlternate energyREITAtl\nenergy3/2/0552wkhigh3/7/05Oil/Gas4/2/05Cornell CapitalView my watchlists\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/portfolios]\n\n第1四半期の収益合計は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"数字透平公司报告创纪录的收益...再次!","the_new_excerpt":"Mon, August 9, 2021, 3:05 PM在这篇文章中。\n\n * 应用程序 [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APPS?p=APPS]-2.07%\n\n关注Apps我的观察清单替代能源REITAtl\n能源3/2/0552wkhigh3/7/05石油/天然气4/2/05Cornell Capital查看我的观察清单\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/portfolios]\n\n第一季度收入总额为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"數字透平公司報告創紀錄的收益...再次!","the_new_excerpt":"Mon, August 9, 2021, 3:05 PM在這篇文章中。\n\n * 應用程序 [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APPS?p=APPS]-2.07%\n\n關注Apps我的觀察清單替代能源REITAtl\n能源3/2/0552wkhigh3/7/05石油/天然氣4/2/05Cornell Capital查看我的觀察清單\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/portfolios]\n\n第一季度收入總額爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-a1accd0d-c4ce-564f-b589-67e3e2f35769","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p262pq/can_you_figure_out_when_i_discovered/","title":"Can you figure out when I discovered Wallstreetbets?","date":"August 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私がいつWallstreetbetsを見つけたか分かりますか？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"你能想出我是什么时候发现华尔街赌城的吗？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你能想出我是什麼時候發現華爾街賭城的嗎？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1425269429261189120","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1425269429261189120","title":"Shares of Moderna have soared so much that the biotechnology company’s valuation is “unjustifiable on a fundamental basis,” said one analyst. https://t.co/TCcUV0x5QC","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 11, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"あるアナリストは、Moderna社の株価があまりにも高騰しているため、このバイオテクノロジー企業の評価は「ファンダメンタルベースで正当化できない」と述べている。https://t.co/TCcUV0x5QC。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"Moderna的股价已经飙升，以至于这家生物技术公司的估值 \"在基本面上是不合理的\"，一位分析师说。https://t.co/TCcUV0x5QC。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"Moderna的股價已經飆升，以至於這家生物技術公司的估值 \"在基本面上是不合理的\"，一位分析師說。https://t.co/TCcUV0x5QC。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-80a82e3f-a9b3-5f34-8ea4-a99762363068","previousId":"RedditPost-a1accd0d-c4ce-564f-b589-67e3e2f35769","nextId":"TweetPost-1425269429261189120","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/p1mhw0/digital_turbine_reports_record_earnings_again/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
