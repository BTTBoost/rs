Most notably for me are their strong free cash flow numbers. Free cash flow for Q1’21 came in at a nice $108M representing a 22% increase over Q1’20. This signals to me that they are losing money only because of non-cash expenses which will be reduced in the future thanks to them paying down loads of debt through funds raised during the SPAC deal.</p>\n\n<p>More positives overlooked in their earnings include eCash volume and revenue up 60%, partnerships with coinbase and other &quot;internet money&quot; exchanges, and an active M&amp;A pipeline.</p>\n\n<h3>The SPAC stench will wear off</h3>\n\n<p>In it’s short life, the stock is down 27% the last six months following the SPAC merger with Foley Transimene Acquisition corp. Yes, the earnings miss played a role in this but the company also still has the stench of the SPAC associated with it however, this isn’t your average SPAC company. Paysafe is already a well-established company. They are the global leader in iGaming which includes everything from sports betting to lottery. They processed a $27.7B worth of transaction in Q1’21, which is no chump change. They also offer eCash solutions for those who prefer to complete transactions in cash and digital wallet solutions for those who don’t. I think investors who may be wary of jumping into the stock because of its SPAC association will one day realize that this isn’t just another SPAC, but a well-established company with room to grow.</p>\n\n<h3>Institutional ownership</h3>\n\n<p>According to whalewisdom.com institutional ownership in PSFE is at the time of writing 412M shares of a total of 723.71M shares outstanding representing about 57% institutional ownership, led by Blackstone group with 160.8M shares. Why is this significant? Because institutions like Blackstone analyze companies and their stocks for a living and they have people much smarter than myself and most of us reading this to do so. You can be certain that if they are buying up so many shares of a company, they are bullish and expecting high returns for their efforts.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not just institutions that are bullish on PSFE either, analysts are consistently giving price targets well above the current price of $11.25 including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Del Grosso (Compass Point) – $19 price target</li>\n<li>Timothy Chiodo (Credit Suisse) – $17 price target</li>\n<li>Darrin Peller (Wolfe Research) – $19 price target</li>\n<li>Daniel Perlin (RBC) – $19 price target</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Growth through U.S iGaming</h3>\n\n<p>It’s clear that the company is currently being bogged down by their latest conservative growth numbers so for this stock to break out, it will need a catalyst. That catalyst will be the legalization of online gambling that will almost certainly sweep through the U.S. Paysafe is currently live in 15 states leaving 35 more states to go. With the promise of those sweet sweet tax dollars, I believe most states will eventually cave in and Paysafe will be there to offer them the picks and shovels required to make it a reality.</p>\n\n<h4>Disclaimer</h4>\n\n<p>The contents on this site are for informational and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial, accounting, or legal advice.
