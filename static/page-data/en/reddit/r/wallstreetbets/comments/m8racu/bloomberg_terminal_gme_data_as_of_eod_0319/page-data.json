Unfortunately, for retail investors the terminal is locked behind one of the most extreme paywalls and is out of reach for many. Costing roughly $24,000 per year, I&#39;m sure you can see why...</p>\n\n<p>In this post I will not be talking much about what the numbers means, or doing any sort of analysis, this is strictly informative. I will say, if anyone wishes that I pull up some other data that I have not included, let me know and I will do my best to accommodate, but I cannot make promises that I&#39;ll get around to it. If anyone also has any questions, feel free to ask away and once again I will do my best.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let us begin. I&#39;ll start with the least exciting and work our way up to the stuff I know people want to see.</p>\n\n<h1>Basic Candle Chart w/ SMAVG (50/100/200) 2021-03-19 @ 14:23 EST</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9gnjqdgag2o61.png?width=1923&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=804815380400049ee52e42d782a7d489efed7d01\">Nothing too exciting but for those wondering what this would look like, here you go.</a></p>\n\n<h1>Twitter Discussion and overall sentiment for 5 periods</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eekhbu8cg2o61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e9d8dc71e745d184fb2a6860147c4d6dad11e9\">I will point out the big uptick in discussion, more than was seen over the 3 days prior. </a></p>\n\n<h1>Institutional Ownership Data (As of 12/31/20)</h1>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3v3izomkg2o61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e2b9355311260a0c344f0a1735bd080f252b42e\">Unfortunately, this data is not updated as frequently as institutions are not required to disclose this information on a regular basis.</a></p>\n\n<h1>Institutional Option Holders (12/31/20)</h1>\n\n<p>Once again, not update as often as many would like. But it adds perspective.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kxue25oig2o61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fe48158350849d1300929eb00eb5e00b86264db\">The second largest holder of ANY form of derivative (call or put) is MELVIN CAPITAL who is dealing exclusively in PUTS. Approx. 8&#37; of all options. 60,000 contracts. Also notice Citadel.</a></p>\n\n<h1>Finally, Short Interest</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ydg5mkrng2o61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59b2ba0e7c16aeb6471bf65e426093238ce57e10\">https://preview.redd.it/ydg5mkrng2o61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59b2ba0e7c16aeb6471bf65e426093238ce57e10</a></p>\n\n<h1>Closing Remarks</h1>\n\n<p>I once again will not be doing any analysis on these graphs and numbers, I&#39;m sure someone else will be happy to do that. This is strictly informative and for the sake of this post I am neither bearish nor bullish on GME. I hope some of you find this post useful and informative and I encourage anyone to use this data coupled with their own research and determinations to work on a DD. Once again, I will try my best to answer questions or collect more information but depending that may prove challenging based on the number of requests.</p>\n\n<p>With that said I hope everyone has a fantastic weekend, if you&#39;ve been staring at a screen all week, there is no better time to take a break. Mental health is important through all of this craziness, drink water, get some fresh air and sunlight, and just decompress. Cheers.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/","title":"BLOOMBERG TERMINAL GME DATA - As of EOD 03-19","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-20T05:28:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-20 05:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a1376228-621a-542f-86c0-491dfa8fd410","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"yodisc","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/yodisc","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"yodisc","score":2414,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"BLOOMBERG TERMINAL GME DATA - As of EOD 03-19","the_new_excerpt":"很多人都知道，彭博终端是投资者最好的工具之一，它可以帮助投资者\n利用。遗憾的是，对于散户来说，终端机被锁在了一个叫 \"小黑屋 \"的地方。\n的最极端的付费墙，对很多人来说是遥不可及的。成本大约为\n年薪24000元，我相信你能明白为什么...\n\n在这篇文章中，我将...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"BLOOMBERG TERMINAL GME DATA - As of EOD 03-19","the_new_excerpt":"很多人都知道，彭博終端是投資者最好的工具之一，它可以幫助投資者\n利用。遺憾的是，對於散戶來說，終端機被鎖在了一個叫 \"小黑屋 \"的地方。\n的最極端的付費牆，對很多人來說是遙不可及的。成本大約爲\n年薪24000元，我相信你能明白爲什麼...\n\n在這篇文章中，我將...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cc883685-5aa6-5bc2-982c-26d9beff44e0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8xmxi/her_hes_probably_cheating_on_me_him/","title":"Her: \"He's probably cheating on me.\" Him:","date":"March 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"她：\"他可能在欺骗我。\" 他：\"他可能在欺骗我。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"她：\"他可能在欺騙我。\" 他：\"他可能在欺騙我。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-4a589342-8752-53bb-91d8-35e71bf98b64","excerpt":"Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and\ntech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday.
