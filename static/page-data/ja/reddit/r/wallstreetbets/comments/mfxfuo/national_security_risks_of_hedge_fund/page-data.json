Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).</p>\n\n<p>The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country&#39;s defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.</p>\n\n<p>This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying &quot;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&quot; holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I&#39;m for $GME going up and did well myself off of it, but everyone commenting &quot;GME hodl&quot; on every single post, no matter how unrelated, you are ruining this sub and helping to reduce the same kind of content that led to the sub discovering and getting on board with $GME to begin with. Dont kill the golden goose over one fucking egg.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfxfuo/national_security_risks_of_hedge_fund/","title":"National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveraging","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-30T01:12:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-30 01:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"18c1de49-d20c-5f11-9e8f-c737200ef8d0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfxfuo/national_security_risks_of_hedge_fund/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfxfuo/national_security_risks_of_hedge_fund/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"The_Greyscale","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Greyscale","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"The_Greyscale","score":3700,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"对冲基金过度杠杆化的国家安全风险","the_new_excerpt":"这和政治有点擦肩而过，看看能不能熬过model吧\n的关注。\n\n随着近期两起备受关注的对冲基金不负责任地成为\n市场上杠杆率过高（Melvin Capital和Archegos），并导致市场\n广泛的影响，看来值得探讨的是全国...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對沖基金過度槓桿化的國家安全風險","the_new_excerpt":"這和政治有點擦肩而過，看看能不能熬過model吧\n的關注。\n\n隨着近期兩起備受關注的對沖基金不負責任地成爲\n市場上槓杆率過高（Melvin Capital和Archegos），並導致市場\n廣泛的影響，看來值得探討的是全國...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2127ac5b-f4a3-530d-934c-2111050dd5fc","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfq71r/wsb_discussion_so_far_this_morning/","title":"WSB discussion so far this morning","date":"March 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今天上午到目前为止的WSB讨论","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天上午到目前爲止的WSB討論","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-71cb4074-df54-54db-9690-f915df7ee8bf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfw9bs/morgan_stanley_has_no_more_rkt_blocks_to_sell_lol/","title":"Morgan Stanley has no more RKT blocks to sell LOL","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 30, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"摩根士丹利没有更多的RKT块出售LOL。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"摩根士丹利沒有更多的RKT塊出售LOL。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-18c1de49-d20c-5f11-9e8f-c737200ef8d0","previousId":"RedditPost-2127ac5b-f4a3-530d-934c-2111050dd5fc","nextId":"RedditPost-71cb4074-df54-54db-9690-f915df7ee8bf","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfxfuo/national_security_risks_of_hedge_fund/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
