But ended up buying a SPY Tech ETF. When I looked back I saw that SONY at times actually outpferforms Microsoft and that for close to 10 years. Granted they were beaten to the ground prior in 2010 but how their last CEO turned that business around in pretty much all areas is a masterwork. When I did more research I found out that an important factor to their success was their CFO at that time, who has become their current new CEO in just 2 years.</p>\n\n<p>At first I was mostly interested in their Playtation devision because I see how far ahead they are in storytelling and grahpics compared to other AAA developers and publishers.</p>\n\n<p>But now I actually like each divison they are in:</p>\n\n<p>Television/Pictures: they dont have a big streaming service but they produce like 2 or 3 of Netflix biggest hits (The Crown, Bridgerton, Cobra Kai, Better call Saul) and they did Breaking Bad. I feel their television arm is morphing more and more into another HBO quality wise. I expect Netflix, Apple, Amazon and Disney to lit. fight for this content in future and Sony television can easy profit. And well Spiderman: Now way Home is a Sony movie afterall and breaking records for that franchise.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Music: Sony Music is the 2nd largest Music label in the world and they are not stopping growing. Again they dont own a streaming service, but they make equal good money by licensing and with the closer becoming fan interaction of artists and their fans --maybe in VR-- (where Sony is also big into btw.) I can see them going a more direct way to present live conerts etc. skipping Spotify, Youtube etc. They already partnered up with one of the big 3 kpop labels to get as one of the first big music labels exposure to that lucrative market, so they are in the Zeitgeist.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Electronics/Sensing/Imaging: I see mostly growth in Sensing and imaging technology for the EV market(cars and other vehicles). Electronics I dont think is too hot at the moment but I see their TVs and Smartphone being in the premium segment now where margin is better. Its already worth it to have that direct 2 consumer relationship imo and they can build up from here with VR and AR devices.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Gaming: With Tencent is Sony the best and fastest growing Gaming company imo.</p>\n\n<p>They are quite heavily advancing with their Playstation Studios portfolio aquiring left and right and increasing their existing studio size. I am not into the metaverse talk, but when Playtation would want to one Im sure they could. They talk how they want more exposure to 1st party big multiplayer titles, whereas last generation they mostly concentrated their efforts to deliver big quality singe player games. Mulitplayer brings more profit, so thats bullish. They are also devloping Playstation VR2 for release in 2022, which would for example let you play also any non VR game with rudimentary VR support. With all the metaverse (bullshit)talk I can see that reveal create kinda a buzz.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>They also own Sony Bank, one of the biggest japanese digital banks.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>But thats about their current divisions. In the coming years, they plan to enter semi business in corporation with TSMC and build up a new core business pillar for them as they call it: Anime. They now own the biggest box office anime hit in history with Demon Salyer. That IP is so big, it generated 8 BILLION USD in revenue (<a href=\"https://animesweet.com/anime/demon-slayer-the-series-unstoppable-success-topped-8-billion/\">https://animesweet.com/anime/demon-slayer-the-series-unstoppable-success-topped-8-billion/</a>).  Granted, across different companies and with Merch, (mobile/console)games etc. but when they can create one such anime hit, they have the chance for another. Netflix for example produces --while quality anime content-- but not one of that caliber of Demon Salyer. With Sony having much closer ties to many japanese anime studios I can see them creating the defacto streaming service and having a chance for that next One Piece killer. Merch is brining in the money, not the movies itself. They already own Funimation and Crunchyroll and are currently working on combining them...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>YTD performance: 36%</p>\n\n<p>Market Cap: 154B</p>\n\n<p>Past 5 years: 304%</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qwop2h/dd_sony_is_more_than_the_sum_of_its_parts_and/","title":"DD: $SONY is more than the sum of its parts and outpferforming 90% of US blue chips.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-18T17:05:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-18 17:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qwop2h","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qwop2h/dd_sony_is_more_than_the_sum_of_its_parts_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qwop2h/dd_sony_is_more_than_the_sum_of_its_parts_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"masteroflich","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/masteroflich","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"masteroflich","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"DD: $SONYは、米国のブルーチップの90%を凌駕しており、パーツの総和を超えています。","the_new_excerpt":"投資を始めた時に遊びの口座で買った銘柄がいくつかあります（2末半ば\n2019): SONY、MSFT、NFLXです。しかし、結局SPY Tech ETFを購入しました。振り返ってみると\n振り返ってみると、SONYは実際にMicrosoftを上回ることがあり、それが10年近く続いています。\n10年近くも。確かに、彼らは以前には地面に叩きつけられていましたが・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"DD：$SONY比其各部分的总和还要多，而且表现优于90%的美国蓝筹股。","the_new_excerpt":"我开始投资时，在我的游戏账户中买了几只股票（2月底中\n2019): 索尼，MSFT，NFLX。但最后还是买了一个SPY科技ETF。当我回头看时\n我看到SONY有时实际上超过了微软，而且是在接近\n10年。当然，他们之前被打到了地上，在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DD：$SONY比其各部分的總和還要多，而且表現優於90%的美國藍籌股。","the_new_excerpt":"我開始投資時，在我的遊戲賬戶中買了幾隻股票（2月底中\n2019): 索尼，MSFT，NFLX。但最後還是買了一個SPY科技ETF。當我回頭看時\n我看到SONY有時實際上超過了微軟，而且是在接近\n10年。當然，他們之前被打到了地上，在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qwr6np","excerpt":"The central bank cut its one-week repo rate by 1 percentage point to 15%,\nmarking the third straight reduction in interest rates under governor Sahap\nKavcioglu from 19% at the start of September.
