Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like &quot;Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined&quot; or &quot;Tesla has decades of growth priced in&quot; are very prevalent, especially on this sub.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla&#39;s market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla&#39;s trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For those who don&#39;t like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don&#39;t like reading, skip straight to &quot;The Numbers&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>The method</strong></p>\n\n<p>While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let&#39;s use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>The trends</strong></p>\n\n<p>In terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>The future</strong></p>\n\n<p>Obviously Tesla won&#39;t be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.</p>\n\n<p>That said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3&#39;s (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>The numbers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Putting all of the information from the previous section together, I have create a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla&#39;s numbers through 2024. In the worst case I assume there are significant unforeseen setbacks that cause them to fall short of those numbers, in the best case I expect them to meet or even slightly exceed them. This brings us to the following projection:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sales</strong></p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Worst Case</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Best Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2022</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">1,400,000</td>\n<td align=\"left\">1,700,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2023</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">2,000,000</td>\n<td align=\"left\">2,700,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2024</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">2,600,000</td>\n<td align=\"left\">3,300,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><strong>ASP</strong></p>\n\n<p>While I mentioned ASPs will likely increase, I have chosen to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 because it&#39;s too difficult to predict. This should make sure the final numbers remain conservative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Revenue</strong></p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Worst Case</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Best Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2022</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">$70B</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$85B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2023</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">$100B</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$135B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2024</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">$130B</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$165B</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><strong>Operating Margin</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Worst Case</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Best Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2022</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">14%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">14%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2023</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">15%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">18%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2024</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">16%</td>\n<td align=\"left\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><strong>Net Income</strong></p>\n\n<p>Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Worst Case</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Best Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2022</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">$9,8B</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$11,9B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2023</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">$15,0B</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$24,3B</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2024</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">$20,8B</td>\n<td align=\"left\">$33,0B</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><strong>P/E</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:</p>\n\n<table><thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\"></th>\n<th align=\"left\">Worst Case</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Best Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2022</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">102</td>\n<td align=\"left\">84</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2023</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">67</td>\n<td align=\"left\">41</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>2024</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">48</td>\n<td align=\"left\">30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><strong>The conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Should Tesla trade flat at around a $1T market cap and they continue on their current trajectory, they will be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Depending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock has between 1 and 3 years of growth priced in.</p>\n\n<p>So to conclude, the popular sentiment that &quot;Tesla has decades of growth priced in&quot; is false.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important side note</strong></p>\n\n<p>For simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla&#39;s automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla&#39;s future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid &quot;FSD doesn&#39;t exist&quot; and &quot;energy is a scam&quot; kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: Based on Tesla&#39;s current trends, they have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/","title":"On Tesla's valuation","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-30T13:56:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-30 13:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qj07jj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Ehralur","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ehralur","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Ehralur","score":867,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"テスラの評価について","the_new_excerpt":"テスラのバリュエーションは、ここ数年、株式市場で最も話題になっているテーマのひとつでしょう。\nは、ここ数年の株式市場で最も議論されているテーマのひとつです。テスラは確かに評価が高く、感情も\nテスラの時価総額は、他のすべての自動車メーカーの合計よりも高い」とか\nまた、「Teslaには数十年分の成長が織り込まれている」といった意見も非常に多く見受けられます...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"关于特斯拉的估价","the_new_excerpt":"特斯拉的估值可能是过去几年股市中争论最激烈的话题之一。\n过去几年中，特斯拉的估值可能是股票市场上最热门的话题之一。特斯拉的估值当然很高，而诸如 \"特斯拉的市值比其他所有汽车制造商的总和还要高 \"或 \"特斯拉的估值比其他所有汽车制造商的总和还要高 \"这样的观点\n诸如 \"特斯拉的市值比所有其他汽车制造商的总和还要高 \"或\n\"特斯拉有几十年的增长潜力 \"的观点非常盛行，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於特斯拉的估價","the_new_excerpt":"特斯拉的估值可能是過去幾年股市中爭論最激烈的話題之一。\n過去幾年中，特斯拉的估值可能是股票市場上最熱門的話題之一。特斯拉的估值當然很高，而諸如 \"特斯拉的市值比其他所有汽車製造商的總和還要高 \"或 \"特斯拉的估值比其他所有汽車製造商的總和還要高 \"這樣的觀點\n諸如 \"特斯拉的市值比所有其他汽車製造商的總和還要高 \"或\n\"特斯拉有幾十年的增長潛力 \"的觀點非常盛行，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qinajf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qinajf/tesla_making_bears_hibernate_have_a_great_weekend/","title":"Tesla making bears hibernate 🥶 Have a great weekend","date":"October 30, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"熊を冬眠させるテスラ🥶素敵な週末を","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"特斯拉让熊冬眠 🥶 祝你周末愉快","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"特斯拉讓熊冬眠 🥶 祝你週末愉快","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qiztmg","excerpt":"Back a few weeks ago, this was the talk of the stock market.\n\nI remember that broad red day we had that Monday when Evergrande’s interest\npayments were due and nobody was sure if they were going to be able to do it.
