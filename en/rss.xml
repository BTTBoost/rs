&lt;p&gt;After trading mostly even throughout the day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) sold off sharply in the last hour. Early in the morning, President Biden announced this morning that Jerome Powell was renominated to lead the Federal Reserve for another four years. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who was Powell’s main competitor, was nominated as the Vice-Chair. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for more inflation data set to be released later this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, President Biden announced he was nominating Jerome Powell for a second, four-year term as the Chair of the Federal Reserve and Fed Governor Lael Brainard as the Vice-Chair, ending weeks of speculation who would be tapped to run the nation’s Central Bank. Biden was expected to select either Powell or current Fed Governor Lael Brainard as Fed chair. Following the nomination, Powell will go before the Senate Banking Committee for approval, and if confirmed, will serve another four-year term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Browne, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Pimco, said “I think this was largely expected by markets. Certainly there were some conversations in markets over the last couple of weeks about Brainard potentially being elevated to the Fed chair position. But by and large the expectation was for consistency. You may see a little bit of a rally on the back of this with the expectation that policy is going to remain in place and intact, and everything that’s been articulated already by the Fed is likely to continue into 2022 and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, more inflation data is set to be released later this week, which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation and any potential reactions by the Federal Reserve. The Core Personal Consumptions Expenditure (PCE) , which is Fed’s preferred measure for inflation, is set to be released Wednesday and expected to show a 4.1% year-over-year increase. This would be the biggest annual jump in roughly three decades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constellation Brands (STZ), the maker of Corona beer, is reportedly exploring for a deal to merge with Monster Beverage, according to a report by Bloomberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private Equity Firm KKR made a $12 billion bid to bring Telecom Italia private, sending shares of the Italian telecommunication company higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales of previously owned homes in the US unexpectedly jumped to their highest level in nine months in October, signaling that housing demand is picking up against a backdrop of low mortgage rates and strengthening labor markets. Existing home sales rose by 0.8% month-over-month in October, reaching an annualized rate of 6.34 million, according to data from the National Association of Realtors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors (GM) bought a 25% stake in electric boat startup Pure Watercraft for $150 million. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix (NFLX) said it is acquiring special effects company Scanline VFX, which is behind the effects of “Stranger Things” and “Game of Thrones”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla Inc is planning to spend more than $1 billion on its new vehicle factory in Austin, Texas, and plans to complete construction by the end of this year, public filings with a Texas state agency showed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA (NVDA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-absurd-beauty-of-hacking-nvidias-gaugan-2-ai-image-machine/&quot;&gt;today detailed an AI system called GauGAN2,&lt;/a&gt; the successor to its GauGAN model, that lets users create lifelike landscape images that don’t exist using text. The program was developed by feeding 10 million high quality images into NVIDIA’s Selene supercomputer. This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist&amp;#39;s vision into a high-quality AI-generated image. The practical benefi is that one can use a few words to get a basic image together without any drawing at all and then tweak details to refine the final output. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other news, NVIDIA is fast tracking development of its “&lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/22/how-nvidia-aims-to-demystify-zero-trust-security/&quot;&gt;Zero-Trust” cybersecurity platform built using their data processing units and Morpheus AI&lt;/a&gt;, citing vulnerabilities in it’s clients&amp;#39; datacenters. Very basically, traditional cybersecurity relies on a perimeter or firewall that prevents viruses and hacks from getting into your computer. Zero-trust is an architecture that also constantly monitors all the data in the system and is able to enforce strict control on what each user can do on the network. Manuvir Das, Head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA said, “You cannot just rely on the firewall on the outside, you have to assume that any application or any user inside your data center is a bad actor,” and “It is not our intention to be a direct provider of cybersecurity solutions. We have built the platform for cybersecurity companies to integrate into their solutions.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ticker ARKG) has seen roughly $520 million of outflows in November amid sinking returns. The fund is down 27% year-to-date as investors shun health-care stocks in favor for more cyclical names that perform well during an economic recovery. Even so, the ETF is faring far worse than the broader biotech sector, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index up 10.49% this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARKG is currently trading at $66.38 a share, lower than its level a year ago, before a steep rally that crested early in 2021. The genomics fund has also seen the largest outflows among Ark’s ETFs this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting that typically loyal Ark investors have been bailing on the ETF,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an advisory firm. “The fund’s assets have been chopped in half since February. While I don’t believe the ETF is experiencing some of sort of ‘doom loop,’ clearly the outflows are putting downward price pressure on the underlying holdings and testing the will of remaining fund owners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ETF’s two top holdings, Teladoc Health Inc. and Exact Sciences Corp., have weighed on its performance, with drops of some 45% and 37% this year, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent outflows may be due to investors looking for shorter-term opportunities into the year-end and freeing up cash, said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ark Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood is well-known for prioritizing longer term investments over short-term gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a 5-10 year hold. AI in health care is going to change the way that we can predict, treat and manage the most difficult diseases like cancer, and the Ark fund gives investors access to the companies who are on the cutting edge of that research,” said Jablonski.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden made the announcement Monday morning following weeks of speculation that a push from progressives might see Fed Governor Lael Brainard get the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainard instead will be vice chair of the board of governors; she had been widely expected to get a separate vice chair for supervision post, which oversees the nation’s banking system. As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,” Biden said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its “decisive” action in the early days of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank’s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,” a White House statement said. “During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated – in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House statement said the recovery is “a testament to the success of the President’s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s economy back on track.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden said that Powell and Brainard “also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political pressure, and a Covid struggle
President Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers “boneheads” for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation’s banking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation’s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Under Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,” Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden’s agenda.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden’s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief’s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed’s chair and is the country’s first female Treasury secretary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,” Yellen said. “I think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed’s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a “dangerous man” and that she would oppose his renomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the constant rhetoric that &amp;#39;iNflaTIOn iz TranZuhToRY&amp;#39; and &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1461651190144503808&quot;&gt;no one saw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1461651190144503808&quot;&gt; it coming&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; many companies that have benefited greatly from the increased prices were discounted. Nobody wanted to invest in lumber, freight, and oil because these price hikes were supposed to be temporary. As many are now admitting, inflation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-may-need-to-pivot-to-faster-taper-waller-says-11637336865&quot;&gt;here to stay&lt;/a&gt; and so are the aforementioned companies&amp;#39; sick margins. The catalyst is a great repricing of undervalued companies. *Think Dr. Burry buying Gamestop at $5* We literally have boomer stocks growing revenues and margins at the rates of start-ups (more on that below*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping Rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the decreased labor force and QE, shipping rates have climbed close to 600% over the last year. However, recently they&amp;#39;ve plateaued and haven&amp;#39;t shown any sign of returning to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6v7dj97fdz081.png?width=2474&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7a78e8ce52437c4b66dd9c349bebfd1fa66c019f&quot;&gt;From $ZIM &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these rates are mostly just for freight from the East to the West. Prices are incredibly low if you&amp;#39;d like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/explained-why-the-shipping-container-crisis-will-not-end-soon-7743451.html&quot;&gt;ship the other way&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Shanghai-Los Angeles route was over $10,000 but under $1,300 in the reverse direction in the recent weeks&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending continues to hit &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=19&amp;amp;step=2#reqid=19&amp;amp;step=2&amp;amp;isuri=1&amp;amp;1921=underlying&quot;&gt;all-time highs&lt;/a&gt; and the Port of LA is&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/cargo-ships-queues-pushed-150-miles-from-southern-california-coast-2021-11&quot;&gt; jakkt to the tits in congestion&lt;/a&gt; with over 100 ships queued in a conga line 100 miles south. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/q9hfrdebiz081.png?width=2636&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=844822e0824142df9b8d61f9c22a8f8f55e5a3b2&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q9hfrdebiz081.png?width=2636&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=844822e0824142df9b8d61f9c22a8f8f55e5a3b2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/p7qqvzd7iz081.jpg?width=1300&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0b2707167e384e315aa1cd403099073ac1dffc21&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/p7qqvzd7iz081.jpg?width=1300&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0b2707167e384e315aa1cd403099073ac1dffc21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Play&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any shipping company seems mispriced, however, I see the greatest opportunity I see is with $ZIM. &lt;a href=&quot;https://s27.q4cdn.com/416879924/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/ZIM-Q3-2021-investors-call-Final-17-11-2021.pdf&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; the link to their latest earnings. *spoiler: they absolutely crushed it*. I have literally looked at the top 12 largest, publicly-traded shipping companies and this one seems to have the greatest mismatch on price:value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ZIM has one of (if not, the) highest margins of any shipping company in the industry with a 66% EBITDA margin (that&amp;#39;s double $APPL). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it has been their shipping fleet acquisitions, the freight prices, or efficient logistics $ZIM has 18X&amp;#39;d their profit YoY. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ZIM went public in January this year and has averaged a 100% return every quarter. For a &lt;strong&gt;REAL&lt;/strong&gt; company, this is unparalleled. They literally just go up and to the right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/ptd3omdjlz081.png?width=2522&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=81cc178b902e40d8a4002aff7948ff657e4d5166&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ptd3omdjlz081.png?width=2522&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=81cc178b902e40d8a4002aff7948ff657e4d5166&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at the top 12 highest market cap shipping companies, $ZIM seems to be the most mispriced. The average PE of the shipping industry is  ~6.9X (nice). While $ZIM trades @ 3.3X. Even if $ZIM were to normalize at the industry&amp;#39;s average, that&amp;#39;s over a 100% return. If you look at revenue, $ZIM brings in roughly 20% of Maersk&amp;#39;s $AMKBY (the largest shipping company by MC) revenue while trading at ~10% of the valuation.  If you were to normalize $ZIM (66% margin) with $AMKBY (41% margin) based upon net profit, you&amp;#39;d expect a 130% return from the current price of $57. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/6wve2xa8tz081.png?width=1520&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2e2984facc1c048ebec1529ea691d516ad1161cb&quot;&gt;Comparison across some shipping companies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Next Run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After $ZIM completely destroyed their Q3 earnings ($12.16 vs $8.99 EPS) and announced a market-leading dividend (20% of quarter&amp;#39;s net income with a 4th quarter dividend equal to 30-50% of annual net income), and heavy volume has started coming in over the last few days. People are starting to notice. If we assume a similar profit for Q4, their &amp;#39;21 annual profit is ~$4.5B. We know that based on shares outstanding divided by net income with a 20% dividend is $2.50. This means that their 4th quarter dividend (assumed at the midpoint of 40%) will be $15. At a current share price of $57, you&amp;#39;d basically get &lt;strong&gt;a 26% return just from a single dividend.&lt;/strong&gt;  If you don&amp;#39;t think boomers and pensions that love dividends aren&amp;#39;t going to jump into this stock then go YOLO into some weed stocks (RIP. Long $ROPE). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$ZIM&amp;#39;s ex-dividend date is Dec 15th so, if you&amp;#39;d like the dividend (like me) you&amp;#39;d have to get in before that date. If you think the stock will massively skyrocket from dividend investors, here&amp;#39;s the options chain. You&amp;#39;ll notice the most volume taking place at the $60 strike calls. These calls also have the greatest #gamma and could offer a great return with a breakeven price of $62.60. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/187r26jnqz081.png?width=2574&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3f502b943a2717b68a7a813f87e02fb99a2d554&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/187r26jnqz081.png?width=2574&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3f502b943a2717b68a7a813f87e02fb99a2d554&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 shares @ $57.50&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*This is literally my uneducated, unlicensed opinion. Don&amp;#39;t listen to me. You&amp;#39;ll Lose money\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s noteworthy that just because hedge funds own these stock, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they are completely bullish on them in the near term. It&amp;#39;s very possible they are running shorts in the various forms (covered calls, puts, etc) against their own holdings to hedge themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing that stuck out to me here is BKNG&lt;/strong&gt;, which seems  overvalued, given it is trading at a price that is well above pre-pandemic levels and a P/E for this year over 55. Earnings are projected to grow at 130% next year.  That means the company would have about $100 per share in earnings. BKNG has traded very richly for some time, so applying a healthy 25X multiple on earnings, that would project a stock price of $2500 next year. In this market, a p/e of 25 looks pretty low, especially if the company continues to grow revenues quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales for Q3 came in just under $4.7B&lt;/strong&gt;, which puts it on pace to exceed 2019 revenues of $15B in 2022 IF the trajectory continues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BKNG sold off big after its last earnings report, despite the fact they delivered a healthy beat of expectations. The drop is presumably because expectations had grown too high in advance of earnings, on concerns that COVID would impact travel, and on profit taking.  It&amp;#39;s now down over 300 points from its high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting to see the trend reversal that just occurred in the travel sector. AirBnB, BKNG, and Expedia, were all up double digits from mid-August and in the past 10 days, all 3 are down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attractive entry point for BKNG?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be, but I&amp;#39;m betting the stock will retreat further as COVID cases rise due to holiday travels.  I&amp;#39;ll be looking to buy the stock if it dips back to 2,100 again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of your wondering what the hell to do now, I introduce you to a new unsung hero Michael Gayed. Michael has found a way to systemically outperform the S&amp;amp;P 500 by over 3x while taking on less risk and it&amp;#39;s an extremely simple investment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone says that triple leveraged ETFs have volatility decay and are not meant for long-term holding. Well guess what, those people are idiots. Let&amp;#39;s look at the data: If you invested in UPRO using this guy&amp;#39;s simple strategy, backtested all the way back to 1928, you would have returned 27% CAGR while the S&amp;amp;P did 9% and by taking on half as much risk (0.6 Sharpe ratio for this strategy vs. 0.3 for buy &amp;amp; hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are simple, if the underlying index closes below the 200 day moving average, you sell. Once it crosses back above the 200 MA, then reenter. That is it. &lt;strong&gt;Investing $10k in 1928 with this strategy would have returned $28 TRILLION (with a T) while the S&amp;amp;P would have returned $39 million.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this works is because of the lack of volatility above the 200 MA, and higher volatility below the 200 MA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the sweet taste of compounding returns my friends because this is a ticket to an early retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Read the damn paper.&lt;/p&gt;
