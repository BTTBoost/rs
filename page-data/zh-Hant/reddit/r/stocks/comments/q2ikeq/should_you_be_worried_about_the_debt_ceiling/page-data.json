While there is a lot of political grandstanding involved in what should be a regular process, in this week’s analysis, we are going to leave the politics aside and deep-dive into the debt limit, how it can affect the financial markets, and what happened last time the U.S almost defaulted?  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the Debt Limit and why is it a cause of concern now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The debt limit is the total amount of money the U.S Govt is allowed to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations (Social Security, Medicaid, interest on the national debt, etc.). You can think of it as the credit limit available to a country. The debt limit was created in the early 20th century so that the treasury did not need to ask permission each time for it to issue bonds. (Again, exactly like a credit limit where the bank does not care what you use it for as long as it’s under your limit)</p>\n\n<p>The cause for concern regarding this is that the current U.S national debt stands at $28.43 Trillion and the borrowing cap is set at $28.4 Trillion. Technically the country has hit the debt limit last July and the Treasury has been using extraordinary measures [1] to delay the default. It’s estimated that Treasury will run out of funds sometime between Oct 15th and Nov 4th [2] and then will default on its interest payments.</p>\n\n<p>But it’s not like raising the debt ceiling is an extraordinarily rare event. It has been revised more than 5 times in the last decade and to quote the U.S Treasury</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Historical analysis of the debt ceiling controversies</strong></p>\n\n<p>It’s not the first time the debt ceiling has come to the forefront of financial news and we can prepare for the next one by analyzing what happened during the previous debt crises.</p>\n\n<p>I started off thinking I will have to pull all the data manually but Goldman Sachs has done all the heavy lifting <a href=\"https://www.gspublishing.com/content/research/en/reports/2021/09/13/370ef44b-91e7-4a4c-9aa4-7996aba05fde.html\">with this report</a>. Both Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs state that U.S government shutdowns have no meaningful impact on equity returns and the underlying economic conditions were more important to the stock market performance [3]. </p>\n\n<p>Charles Schwab also came to the same conclusion by analyzing the impact of the previous 18 government shutdowns on the S&amp;P 500 and found that the median return over the course of a shutdown was 0.0% and the mean change was -0.6%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If it doesn’t affect markets, why should I care?</strong></p>\n\n<p>While the govt shutdowns don’t have any significant impact on the stock market, a prolonged fight over the debt ceiling can cause U.S Govt to default on its interest payments. The only time the U.S was close to defaulting on public debt was in 2011 due to the delay in raising the debt ceiling. This resulted in Standard &amp; Poor’s downgrading US Credit rating from AAA to AA+ [4].</p>\n\n<p>The downgrade and the debt ceiling debacle caused Wall Street to have its worst day since the 2008 financial crisis with the major U.S Stock indexes sinking between 5% and 7%. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Black swan event of US Debt Default</strong></p>\n\n<p>The U.S Govt has never defaulted on its debt till now. But, even a short-term delay in paying off the interest obligations is bound to have a long-term impact on the economy. In the words of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would be disastrous for the American economy, for global financial markets, and for millions of families and workers whose financial security would be jeopardized by delayed payments</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is because a delayed payment would certainly affect the U.S Credit rating negatively and the international creditors who generally view the treasury debt as risk-free investments (because it is backed by the U.S Govt) would no longer see it that way. This would in turn make it more expensive for the federal govt to borrow money down the line.</p>\n\n<p>Adding to this, a vast majority of the global financial system uses U.S Dollar as the reserve currency. It is considered as the de facto global currency and is kept by many governments as reserves. The dollar is strong only because of the U.S economy and the safety of the U.S dollar. A default by the U.S will shake investor confidence in the currency and is bound to cause a steep drop in exchange rates and will drive significant capital outflows.</p>\n\n<p>While no one exactly knows what would happen in the case of a prolonged default, Moody’s Analytics earlier this month predicted that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>in a prolonged default scenario, the U.S. would slide into recession, with the Gross Domestic Product falling by almost 4%. Some six million jobs would be lost, driving the unemployment rate up to 9%. The resulting stock market sell-off would erase $15 trillion in household wealth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>While I don’t think the U.S is going to substantially default on its public debts, a sentiment that is shared by other rating and financial agencies. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/09/28/how-worried-should-we-be-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-lifted/\">This report</a> from Brookings argues that the treasury would never let the Govt default on its debt payments and would most likely issue new debt and then use that to pay off the old one, all the while staying under the limit.</p>\n\n<p>The last few times a similar issue came up, the congress was able to reach a compromise in the nick of time. But cutting the deal too close to the deadline might spook investors and force the rating agencies to downgrade the debt quality. Both of these, at least in the short term would adversely affect the market. While you should not be extremely concerned about a U.S debt default, it&#39;s a good idea to hedge your portfolio against the expected volatility by having a small amount of long-dated puts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Description-of-Extraordinary-Measures-Aug2021.pdf\">This report</a> by the Department of Treasury explains what are the extraordinary measures taken by the Treasury since July’21. The big three are G Fund, ESF, and CSRDF which you can read about <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/extraordinary-measures-simplified-explainer/\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>[2] The date is difficult to pinpoint due to the uncertainty regarding govt spending as well as the tax revenue estimation.</p>\n\n<p>[3] Although they have noted that the performance of companies that gets more than 20% of their revenues from the Govt underperformed their respective benchmark during the previous debt ceiling crisis.</p>\n\n<p>[4] <a href=\"https://www.fisherinvestments.com/en-us/marketminder/lessons-from-americas-decade-old-downgrade\">This was widely criticized as a poor move</a> on the part of Standard and Poor’s with them giving undue importance to how the politicians were squabbling over the debt ceiling over the actual financial status of the country. S&amp;P’s then president Deven Sharma had to step down within 18 days of downgrading U.S credit.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q2ikeq/should_you_be_worried_about_the_debt_ceiling/","title":"Should you be worried about the debt ceiling crisis? - Analyzing the historical impact of the Debt Ceiling crisis on the stock market","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-06T21:56:24.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-06 21:56","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q2ikeq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q2ikeq/should_you_be_worried_about_the_debt_ceiling/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q2ikeq/should_you_be_worried_about_the_debt_ceiling/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"nobjos","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/nobjos","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"nobjos","score":57,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"債務上限問題を心配すべきか？- デット・シーリング危機が株式市場に与えた歴史的影響を分析する","the_new_excerpt":"先週のニュースでは、米国の値上げをめぐる論争が話題になりました。\n先週のニュースは、米国の債務上限引き上げと米国政府によるデフォルトの影響をめぐる論争で占められていましたが、これには多くの政治的大義名分が含まれています。\nしかし、今週の分析では、通常のプロセスであるはずの政治的な大立ち回りが多く見られます。\n今週の分析では、政治的なことは置いておくことにしましょう。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你应该担心债务上限危机吗？- 分析债务上限危机对股票市场的历史影响","the_new_excerpt":"上周的新闻被围绕提高美国债务上限的争议所主导。\n虽然有很多政治上的噱头，但这并不意味着美国政府就可以不顾一切的违约。\n在这一正常的过程中，有很多政治上的哗众取宠。\n本周的分析中，我们将把政治问题放在一边...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你應該擔心債務上限危機嗎？- 分析債務上限危機對股票市場的歷史影響","the_new_excerpt":"上週的新聞被圍繞提高美國債務上限的爭議所主導。\n雖然有很多政治上的噱頭，但這並不意味着美國政府就可以不顧一切的違約。\n在這一正常的過程中，有很多政治上的譁衆取寵。\n本週的分析中，我們將把政治問題放在一邊...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1445785041586597888","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1445785041586597888","title":"Country ETF Returns since 2011...\n\nHighest: USA @ +14.4% per year. $SPY\nLowest: Brazil @ -5.5% per year. $EWZ\n\nData via @ycharts https://t.co/qBEWiGpKgg","date":"October 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"2011年以降の国別ETFのリターン...\n\n最高。米国 @年率+14.4%。$SPY\n最も低い。ブラジル@年率5.5%。$EWZ\n\nData via @ycharts https://t.co/qBEWiGpKgg","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"2011年以来国家ETF回报率...\n\n最高的。美国 @ 每年+14.4%。$SPY\n最低的。巴西 @ 每年-5.5%。$EWZ\n\n数据来自@ycharts https://t.co/qBEWiGpKgg","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"2011年以來國家ETF回報率...\n\n最高的。美國 @ 每年+14.4%。$SPY\n最低的。巴西 @ 每年-5.5%。$EWZ\n\n數據來自@ycharts https://t.co/qBEWiGpKgg","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q2hxc2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q2hxc2/this_retard_fraudulently_borrowed_4_million_from/","title":"This retard fraudulently borrowed $4 Million from the PPP loan program and then blew it shorting the market.
