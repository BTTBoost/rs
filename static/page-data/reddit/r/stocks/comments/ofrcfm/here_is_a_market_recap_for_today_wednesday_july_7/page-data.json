The Dow Jones (DIA), which has been lagging the other two indexes the last six or so weeks, continued to underperform comparatively. Market participants are currently digesting the Fed’s June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed) and are looking ahead to Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. </p>\n\n<p>Oil prices remain under heavy pressure after recently reaching a multi-year high. In the latest meeting, the two most important members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), failed to reach a deal to increase crude oil production as energy demand rebounds. At the time of writing, Brent crude settled down $2.63 a barrel, or 3.4%, to $74.53, after hitting a session peak of $77.84, its highest since October 2018. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down $1.79, or 2.4%, to $73.37 after touching $76.98, highest since November 2014. Some analysts have speculated that in light of the failure to reach a unilateral decision, individual oil producers may begin to act alone to increase production. Bob Yawger, Director of Energy Futures at Mizuho, said “The market is concerned that the UAE will step in and unilaterally add barrels and other members in OPEC will follow suit.” The White House said Tuesday it was closely monitoring talks by OPEC+ and was &quot;encouraged&quot; after conversations with officials in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>\n\n<p>For equity investors, the focus was squarely on the Federal Reserve’s June Meeting minutes, which will help market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery “was generally seen as not having yet been met”, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, “Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals”. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the Federal Reserve is maintaining current policies in place but noted they were prepared to act if unforeseen pressures or progress to their goals emerged.Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said of the minutes, “If the US economic recovery continues to accelerate to a sufficiently robust level into the summer, the Fed is expected to signal rolling back its asset purchases later this year. But the actual tapering would only take place in 2022, and we believe markets have largely priced in this expectation.” I fully agree, while I expect choppiness when the Fed makes more concrete statements about the taper timeline but do not see that derailing the current bull market. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to “security concerns”. Shares are down double-digits in each of the sessions this week.</li>\n<li>The Labor Department&#39;s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported</li>\n<li>U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. </li>\n<li>Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft’s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete.</li>\n<li>Yesterday, Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled the Cambridge-1, which the company claims is the most powerful supercomputer in the UK. The computer will be dedicated to studying and analyzing the healthcare industry.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Barclays from $161 to $164 at Overweight.
