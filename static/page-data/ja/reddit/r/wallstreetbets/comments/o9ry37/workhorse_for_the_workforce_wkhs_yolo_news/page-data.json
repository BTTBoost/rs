Give us this day our daily mooning; and forgive us our short selling as we forgive those who short sell against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the hedgies. Amen.</strong></p>\n\n<p>My dearest Apes, I speak to you again:</p>\n\n<p>As you&#39;ve seen from my previous posts, WKHS is legally battling with Oskosh (OSK) and the USPS over the unlawful recipient of the contract award. Well, here&#39;s some more important updates:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0.pdf\">https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU THOUROUGHLY READ THE ENTIRETY OF THIS FILING^ (IT IS LOADED WITH INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE UNLAWFUL USPS AWARDING)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The document has been redacted (presumably due to NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) between the parties.</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The USPS’s unreasonable actions directly harm Plaintiff... Had the USPS conducted the procurement in accordance with applicable law, the Solicitation requirements, and fundamental fairness, Workhorse would have been awarded the contract&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The USPS evidently decided early in the NGDV Program that Workhorse would not be the awardee, but it chose not to inform Workhorse of this fact, instead allowing and even encouraging Workhorse to continue to pursue the contract.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In the meantime, the USPS put its thumb on the scale against Workhorse. It falsely blamed Workhorse’s prototype vehicle for a “safety incident” that was clearly the result of the USPS driver’s error. It engaged in discussions with Workhorse that improperly failed to meaningfully notify Workhorse of perceived deficiencies in its proposal and that misled Workhorse as to the areas Workhorse needed to address in its updated proposal. And it unfairly evaluated the merits of Workhorse’s proposal, treating Workhorse far more harshly and holding it to far stricter standards, than it did the other offerors.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>As was the USPS’s design all along, these improper actions left Workhorse with a technical score that ensured it had no fair chance of a contract award.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>None of this was known to Workhorse.</em></strong> &quot;</p>\n\n<p>And the coup de gras:</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Workhorse respectfully requests this Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and to provide the following relief:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>1. Entry of judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against the United States;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>2. Entry of a declaratory judgment that the award to Oshkosh was unlawful and improper and an injunction directing that the award be terminated;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>3. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to reevaluate the offerors’ proposals in accordance with the terms of the Solicitation, applicable laws, and regulations;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>4. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to conduct a new best value determination; and</em></p>\n\n<p><em>5. Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>WKHS YOLO:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/z9kqbhmq92871.png?width=611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c080efa211cf3ce3ad7f9723bd90995ec478092a\">https://preview.redd.it/z9kqbhmq92871.png?width=611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c080efa211cf3ce3ad7f9723bd90995ec478092a</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w1su05rwa2871.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4899ab513666382e4639aad796efec41bd295752\">https://preview.redd.it/w1su05rwa2871.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4899ab513666382e4639aad796efec41bd295752</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fkmq7lmxa2871.png?width=671&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5026e0805ed29faec6ec1417949ef4d496d7057b\">https://preview.redd.it/fkmq7lmxa2871.png?width=671&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5026e0805ed29faec6ec1417949ef4d496d7057b</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vy7pxqeya2871.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b8a57e0fe7323a503d41ab3f010378f79c26373\">https://preview.redd.it/vy7pxqeya2871.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b8a57e0fe7323a503d41ab3f010378f79c26373</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i680ke7za2871.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af42a163d8326270ea6f5d7d0c1edf82a8d4a133\">https://preview.redd.it/i680ke7za2871.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af42a163d8326270ea6f5d7d0c1edf82a8d4a133</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now once again, I will reiterate briefly:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The contract was awarded to Oshkosh, who cannot confirm neither deny that the company submitted an EV model for durability testing. Nor did they say whether they have performed a powertrain transition swap, swapping out an internal combustion engine transmission for electric counterparts, as the contract stated. (See below)</li>\n<li>The fact that our favorite hedgies are back at it again, (See their WKHS short position below) is once again short against a company that is purposely being driven down with the help of our Post Master General for his own personal gain.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you can tell, the horse community is growing, media mentions are brewing, the short interest is steady, oscillating between 40-60+% depending on who your source are. Currently, we will use ORTEX, although not always 100% accurate:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dqvvo7d1b2871.png?width=661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89bbb41d7977fffb99ad654902e86517b612adaf\">https://preview.redd.it/dqvvo7d1b2871.png?width=661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89bbb41d7977fffb99ad654902e86517b612adaf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>OPTION ANAYLSIS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/650o4h88b2871.png?width=3012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf252638d3a9784eda0fbb6c19bd7546f683fe7c\">7/2 Expiry Option Chain</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Above, you can see that I coded shares outstanding as a percentage of WKHS shares tied into calls (meaning they are short). From the image above, you can see that more than 1.65% of shares outstanding sit at the 18 strike. Also, 1.47% shares outstanding are short at the 30 strike. Not to mention, Open Interest Updates the following trading day, so this means that WKHS was short to these percentages as of Friday&#39;s trading day close. So, let us take a closer look at the volume.</li>\n<li>At the 18 Strike there is currently over 37k volume and 20k volume at the 20 strike. This is massive, considering the open interest at the 18 strike currently resides at 22,065. And the 20 OI being 2,863.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, we need to be smart apes. We are competing against the hedgies, let us remember that. So, let us look at the put side. Where is Citadel trying to press us down to?</p>\n\n<p>From the looks of it, 15. Which Today, there was 13k volume in the 15 strike with only 4k OI. Presumably, a lot more puts were written today implying downward pressure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HERE&#39;S THE KICKER:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The float is roughly 135,000,000. Half is short sold (~67 Million shares) Todays volume is 44 million+ and climbing while I write this. LOL!!!!! Do the math people. <strong>(44/67, that is nearly 2/3&#39;s.)</strong> We are pretty much nearing the point where if majority of the float is swallowed up and everyone sits on their hands and HODLs, you know the outcome <strong>(GME, AMC)</strong>. The pressure is on the hedgies my dearest Apes, we just simply buy and HODL and let those greedy bastards overleveraged themselves into bankruptcy.</p>\n\n<p>OH AND LASTLY, DID I MENTION SHITADEL HOLDS A SHORT POSITION TOO? ;)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2k06n84jb2871.png?width=2507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e30d7dc67e0b11cbfed5312adde0491e2cd66d34\">https://preview.redd.it/2k06n84jb2871.png?width=2507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e30d7dc67e0b11cbfed5312adde0491e2cd66d34</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9ry37/workhorse_for_the_workforce_wkhs_yolo_news/","title":"WORKHORSE FOR THE WORKFORCE: WKHS YOLO + NEWS","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"June 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-29T03:52:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-29 03:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"aeff6666-f3c9-50fd-bb74-ceed20ce472b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9ry37/workhorse_for_the_workforce_wkhs_yolo_news/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9ry37/workhorse_for_the_workforce_wkhs_yolo_news/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"shouldabeenalawyer69","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/shouldabeenalawyer69","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"shouldabeenalawyer69","score":1548,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"のワークホースです。wkhs yolo + news","the_new_excerpt":"ロケット船に乗っている我らが猿よ、汝のワークホース・テンディによって神聖化された、汝の月よ\n汝の月は来る、汝の意志はGMEのようにWKHSで行われるであろう。この日、我々に日々の\nそして、空売りを許し、空売りをした者を許します。\nそして、私たちを誘惑に導かず、私たちを...から救い出してください。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"劳动力的主力军。WKHS YOLO + 新闻","the_new_excerpt":"我们的人猿，在火箭船中的艺术，被你的工作马10dies所敬仰，你的月亮\n将会到来；你的旨意将在WKHS上实现，如同在GME上一样。赐予我们今天的日常\n月亮；原谅我们的卖空行为，就像我们原谅那些卖空我们的人一样。\n饶恕我们的卖空行为，就像我们饶恕那些卖空我们的人一样；不要让我们陷入诱惑，而是救我们脱离......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"勞動力的主力軍。WKHS YOLO + 新聞","the_new_excerpt":"我們的人猿，在火箭船中的藝術，被你的工作馬10dies所敬仰，你的月亮\n將會到來；你的旨意將在WKHS上實現，如同在GME上一樣。賜予我們今天的日常\n月亮；原諒我們的賣空行爲，就像我們原諒那些賣空我們的人一樣。\n饒恕我們的賣空行爲，就像我們饒恕那些賣空我們的人一樣；不要讓我們陷入誘惑，而是救我們脫離......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1409648291193651204","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1409648291193651204","title":"Facebook becomes the 5th US company to pass the trillion-dollar market cap milestone, joining Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\n\n$FB\n\nCharting via @ycharts https://t.co/Bxw7N8LSL6","date":"June 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"フェイスブック、時価総額1兆ドルを突破！アップル、マイクロソフト、アマゾン、グーグルに続き、米国で5社目の時価総額突破となりました。\n\n$FB\n\nCharting via @ycharts https://t.co/Bxw7N8LSL6","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"Facebook成为第5家市值突破万亿美元里程碑的美国公司，加入苹果、微软、亚马逊和谷歌的行列。\n\n$FB\n\n图表来自@ycharts https://t.co/Bxw7N8LSL6","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"Facebook成爲第5家市值突破萬億美元里程碑的美國公司，加入蘋果、微軟、亞馬遜和谷歌的行列。\n\n$FB\n\n圖表來自@ycharts https://t.co/Bxw7N8LSL6","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-1b897506-c409-5db8-92e7-f7eb4ce1cd47","excerpt":"This is the biggest portion of my portfolio.
