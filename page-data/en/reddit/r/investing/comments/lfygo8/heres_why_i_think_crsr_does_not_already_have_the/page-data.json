Yes, I know, its coming off a bull run so must be ready for the 2021 IV crush right?</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think so.</p>\n\n<p>As someone said better than I last week TL;DR... Corsair has already teased their full 2020 earnings in a prospectus a couple of weeks ago on 1/21. We already know they&#39;re ending with an incredible year. Better yet, the institutional traders have their heads in the sand on it. <a href=\"https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33\">https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33</a></p>\n\n<p>Since that announcement, the stock has increased <strong>27%</strong>. Earnings surprise must be priced in right? I doubt it</p>\n\n<p>Looking at LOGI, the closest competitor. We saw a big dip starting 1/15 (day before earnings announcement), and on 1/18, day of ER). Standard 2021 post-earnings IV crush.... Right before it ran to ATH 2 weeks later.</p>\n\n<p>Now looking at CRSR vs Logi movements <a href=\"https://imgur.com/Bf1gVZB\">https://imgur.com/Bf1gVZB</a> CRSR had a big drop around the same time too. But why? They didnt&#39; release earnings. No major news. No IV crush?</p>\n\n<p><strong>On 1/13/21, Corsair dropped from the sky, on the same day $G M E started its short squeeze and jumped 57% in a day.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maybe a coincidence. Or maybe the 1/13 squeeze wasn&#39;t a price correction, it was direct a reaction to the squeeze and overall market pullback. Hedge funds moving money around.</p>\n\n<p>Oh yea, guess who owns 2% of the outstanding float of CRSR? The kings of Squeeze themselves, Citadel <a href=\"https://imgur.com/xlQNZyJ\">https://imgur.com/xlQNZy</a> </p>\n\n<p>Then price began to recover to normal, until 1/27 and they announced a secondary PO.... price drops again.</p>\n\n<p>And THEN we run to $46-$47...27% gain from the post-drop low of $36.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUT, we are only 7% up from the recent high trading averages of $41, and still 9% below the ATH.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This doesn&#39;t sound like its overpriced at all. Sounds like the recent high IVs are result of the price normalization, not over-buying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I think the IV crush or post-earnings selloff is going to be mild, and a precursor to a very fast bounce-back bull run to ATHs</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfygo8/heres_why_i_think_crsr_does_not_already_have_the/","title":"Here's why I think $CRSR does not already have the earnings surprise priced in","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T17:50:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 17:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"64c9e67a-7367-50fa-8b8e-baaebb843bf9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfygo8/heres_why_i_think_crsr_does_not_already_have_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfygo8/heres_why_i_think_crsr_does_not_already_have_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"downwithnarcy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/downwithnarcy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"downwithnarcy","score":69,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"下面是我认为$CRSR为什么还没有定价的盈利惊喜的原因。","the_new_excerpt":"$CRSR明天将在盘前公布第四季度财报。是的，我知道，它的\n从牛市中走出来，所以一定是为2021年的四级粉碎做好准备吧？\n\n我不这么认为。\n\n就像上周有人说的比我好TL;DR......
