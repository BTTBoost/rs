It&#39;s just rather notable that P/B has not deviated this much, this rapidly, in the last twenty years besides in 2000 and 2008.  While admirable to believe that, because some other singular metric, e.g. NASDAQ 100, isn&#39;t as pronounced, it just tells us that the distribution of systemic risk is manifest differently.  All of these factors should be weighed together, in concordance with your particular investing strategy.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Because a fair value metric (DCF-based) is a much more complex exercise, there is no widely published fair value for the S&amp;P.  In the absence of that sophisticated a metric across the index, the correlation between capital liquidity and P/B warrants closer attention.  This is NOT guidance nor is it a valuation exercise.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Price to Book Ratio, a much discussed metric in the world of <a href=\"https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/valueinvesting/files/files/Buffett1984.pdf\">Graham-and-Doddsville</a>, indicates the premium over tangible book value at which a given stock or index is trading.  When analyzed over time, coupled with other economic and market indicators, it has notable worth as a predictor of stock market bubbles.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-book\">S&amp;P 500 P/B ratio</a>, rocketing to 4.73, up ~57% from March of 2020, is approaching levels not seen since just before the April 2000 market crash—in which the total market, continuing to decline into 2001-2002, lost 75% of its value from its 2000 high.  An increase in the gap between price and tangible book is often correlated with an increase in downward price pressure. </p>\n\n<p>That is, the further a given stock departs from its book value, the more likely it is to decline sharply in market price, particularly in response to market-wide adverse impacts, versus those securities trading closer to their book value.  And so, the degree to which prices have deviated <em>rapidly</em> from overall book value, notably comparable to the increases in P/B just before the crashes of 2000 and 2008, is certainly cause for concern.</p>\n\n<p>Other indicators, including the <a href=\"https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe\">Shiller P/E</a> (which previously surpassed 31 in 1929 and 2000), <a href=\"https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000\">Reverse Repos</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/statistics/gli.htm\">Total Credit to Nonbank Borrowers</a> strongly suggest that excess capital liquidity is driving most of these excess valuations which are not at all tracking corresponding growth in operating cash flows or tangible book value.  In sum, cheap money is driving stock prices into the stratosphere disproportionate to actual performance.  This would not be an issue if the capacity of institutional investors to borrow were unlimited, but of course it is not.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Even with the glut of retail investor expansion in 2000 and 2020 due to, first, the advent of web trading and now the proliferation of mobile apps, retail investors still only represent about <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2021-06-30/retail-traders-account-for-10-of-us-stock-trading-volume-morgan-stanley\">ten percent</a> of the total daily volume... As a sidenote, overnight reverse repos (see previous link) at the NY Federal Reserve have grown from $817 billion last month to $944 billion yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>This tracks with Piketty&#39;s argument that when the return on capital exceeds the actual growth in the economy, income inequality widens and trends toward a bubble.</p>\n\n<p>If the next FOMC meeting in September does not produce changes in monetary policy to more sharply curb the excess liquidity injected into global capital markets since the beginning of the pandemic, we could trend past the Shiller P/E high in 2000, which might suggest an even larger crash looming when policymakers have no choice but to respond to, e.g., inflationary impacts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oz9lis/sp_500_pricetobook_ratio_approaching_pre2000/","title":"S&P 500 Price-to-Book Ratio Approaching Pre-2000 Crash Levels","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 06, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-06T21:46:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-06 21:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"89dec269-8ccc-5a46-bc72-e3cd1122113b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oz9lis/sp_500_pricetobook_ratio_approaching_pre2000/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oz9lis/sp_500_pricetobook_ratio_approaching_pre2000/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"th3cr1t1c","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/th3cr1t1c","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"th3cr1t1c","score":148,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"S&P 500の株価収益率が2000年の大暴落前の水準に近づく","the_new_excerpt":"序章として 私は、絶対に墜落しなければならないと予言しているわけではありません。\n投資家が認識すべき要因は、PBRに加えていくつかの要因の合流点であると考えています。\n投資家が認識すべきPBR以外のいくつかの要因の合流を示唆しているわけではありません。ただ注目すべきは\nこれほどまでにPBRが急激に乖離したことは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"标准普尔500指数的市盈率正在接近2000年之前的崩溃水平","the_new_excerpt":"作为一个前言。我并不是预言一定会发生崩盘，也不是说这是某一个因素造成的。\n我并不是说这是任何一个因素，而是几个因素的汇合。\n除了P/B之外，投资者应该认识到这一点。它只是相当\n值得注意的是，市盈率还没有偏离这么多，这么快，在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"標準普爾500指數的市盈率正在接近2000年之前的崩潰水平","the_new_excerpt":"作爲一個前言。我並不是預言一定會發生崩盤，也不是說這是某一個因素造成的。\n我並不是說這是任何一個因素，而是幾個因素的匯合。\n除了P/B之外，投資者應該認識到這一點。它只是相當\n值得注意的是，市盈率還沒有偏離這麼多，這麼快，在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1423608873139777543","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1423608873139777543","title":"RT @kylascan: The China Crackdown and the Index-Fund-Manager Conundrum✨\n\n(ft the $FRDM index) 🧵 https://t.co/8TFuko9Slc","date":"August 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"RT @kylascan です。中国の弾圧とインデックスファンド・マネージャーの難問✨。\n\n(ft the $FRDM index) 🧵 https://t.co/8TFuko9Slc","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"中国の弾圧とインデックスファンド・マネージャーの難問✨について\n\n(ft the $FRDM index) 🧵 https://t.co/8TFuko9Slc"},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"RT @kylascan: 中国的镇压和指数基金经理人的难题✨\n\n(ft the $FRDM index) 🧵 https://t.co/8TFuko9Slc","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"中国的打压和指数基金经理人的难题✨\n\n(ft the $FRDM index) 🧵 https://t.co/8TFuko9Slc"},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"RT @kylascan: 中國的鎮壓和指數基金經理人的難題✨\n\n(ft the $FRDM index) 🧵 https://t.co/8TFuko9Slc","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":"中國的打壓和指數基金經理人的難題✨\n\n(ft the $FRDM index) 🧵 https://t.co/8TFuko9Slc"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-257d794b-d8ed-59f6-9c6b-470410ac901f","excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 6, 2021\n\nStocks were mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) underperforming, while previous\nlaggards like financial, industrial, and energy stocks picked up the slack,\ndriving both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) to fresh, intraday, all-time\nhighs.
