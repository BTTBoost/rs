Most of their portfolio is low and no carbon emission generation, and moving in that direction long term.</p>\n\n<p>As a company, they continue to trade at undervalued prices. Regulated utilities trade at a 20.5 PE (IPP’s trade at 65.5), while VST trades at 12.8 PE. <strong>If VST traded in line with regulated utilities, it would trade at $36.69</strong> (IPP’s at $117).</p>\n\n<p>This is all before the moonshot quarter, before forwards have increased, before all of these REP’s go on liquidation sale, and before the $1.5B share repurchase (started January 2021) has taken affect.</p>\n\n<p>As a company, VST has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>4 years of YoY Revenue growth (over 100%)</li>\n<li>4 years of YoY Earnings growth (from -$250M to $1B+ TTM)</li>\n<li>4 years of YoY EPS growth</li>\n<li>Insider buying as recent as late December 2020 (right up to the blackout period)</li>\n<li>Pending IG rating in 2021, reducing costs of debt in 2021. This week their application got a whole lot better</li>\n<li>Way undervalued vs industry in nearly every valuation metric 18% FCF, 5.5 EV to EBITDA</li>\n<li>Average analyst rating of mid 30&#39;s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The companies vision to transition to a zero carbon. Many talk about NextEra Energy as the only game in town. VST is far cheaper with a similar mission. Looking NEE’s energy breakdown by source (data from Sustainability&gt;Overview&gt;By the numbers on NEE website ), 58% of generation comes from Natural Gas +Nuclear vs 53% of VST. The difference is looking at the coal generation of 5% for NEE vs 20% EBITA for VST. If VST got rid of 15% of coal generated EBITA, and traded at NEE’s valuation, it would be $83 a share. Both NEE and VST have gas turbines that can be retrofit should hydrogen become economical. VST has the biggest battery in the world, VST is committing $500M+ in green investments annually.</p>\n\n<p>Q4 earnings are out on 2/26, so I’m looking forward to hearing the comments from last week.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/loblud/vistra_corp_vst_texas_utility_that_took/","title":"Vistra Corp (VST): Texas Utility that took Winterization Seriously","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-21T04:52:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-21 04:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e9b22165-0cd8-53ad-bf74-213610bf14b0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loblud/vistra_corp_vst_texas_utility_that_took/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loblud/vistra_corp_vst_texas_utility_that_took/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"veggie-man","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/veggie-man","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"veggie-man","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"威斯特拉公司（VST）。德州认真对待过冬的公用事业","the_new_excerpt":"VST的市值为110亿美元，本周完成了历史性的一周，很有可\n在激增定价上产生了约20-40亿美元的收入，因为它似乎是唯一的德克萨斯州。\n公用事业认真对待过冬问题，几乎所有的发电量都是如此\n上周的发电量...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"威斯特拉公司（VST）。德州認真對待過冬的公用事業","the_new_excerpt":"VST的市值爲110億美元，本週完成了歷史性的一週，很有可\n在激增定價上產生了約20-40億美元的收入，因爲它似乎是唯一的德克薩斯州。\n公用事業認真對待過冬問題，幾乎所有的發電量都是如此\n上週的發電量...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d77b4015-27a7-5598-bb13-78802ce59c5e","excerpt":"To start, I would like to be very clear: I am in no way investing in the short\nsqueeze, and for what I am doing it does not matter whether or not it already\nsquoze vs. \"yOu aRe HeRE\" VolksWagon graph.\n\nMy goal is not to make money.\n\nMy goal is not to lose money.\n\nI am not trying to send a…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loio0b/i_am_going_to_buy_gamestop_all_of_it_dont_upvote/","title":"I am going to buy GameStop.
