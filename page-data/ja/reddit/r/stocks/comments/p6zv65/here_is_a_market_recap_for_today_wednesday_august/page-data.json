This is not at all surprising, there was always an expectation and I have been warning for months that quantitative easing would likely taper towards the end of the year but as usual the market loves to overreact. It just shows that economic recovery is progressing nicely and the market is starting to be able to stand on its own legs. It is important to note that no consensus has emerged between participants regarding the taper timeline, as will be discussed below.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. </p>\n\n<p>First off, before the recap begins, I encourage everyone to read about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, in which the market freaked out after the Fed began tapering asset purchasing programs passed during the height of the 2008 crisis. I think something similar may be happening here. With how far the economy has come in terms of corporate earnings, improving labor market conditions, and an increasingly vaccinated population, the fundamentals for the economy are improving, so it is not surprising that pandemic-era support measures will begin slowing down. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp</a></p>\n\n<p>The timing and potential scope of a potential taper timeline has been a key question in the minds of market participants moving forward. In the latest meeting minutes, the Fed revealed that “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” </p>\n\n<p>In order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, “A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.”</p>\n\n<p>On inflation, the minutes said “With regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory” and “Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound.” However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, “A few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.”</p>\n\n<p>I recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it&#39;s really not that long and super insightful: <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>“There is no success without hardship.” - Sophocles</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p6zv65/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_august/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, August 18, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-18T22:16:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-18 22:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0477ef75-89a0-531d-a42b-686eb34ff323","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p6zv65/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_august/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p6zv65/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_august/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":276,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本日2021年8月18日（水）のMarket Recapをご紹介します。","the_new_excerpt":"2021年8月18日（水）のサイコ・マーケットを振り返る\n\nハイライトがなくて残念だが、この回想を書くのに時間がかかった。\n\n株価はほぼ横ばいで推移した後、最後の2時間で急落しました。\n米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が7月の会合議事録を発表したことを受けて、市場は急落しました。\nFRBが発表した7月の会合の議事録を受けて、市場の最後の2時間に急落しました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"以下是今天（2021年8月18日，星期三）的市场回顾","the_new_excerpt":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年8月18日，星期三\n\n对不起，没有亮点，花了较长的时间来写这一期的回顾报告。\n\n在美联储公布7月会议纪要后，股市在最后两小时内大跌，基本上是横盘整理。\n在美联储7月会议纪要发布后，市场出现了暴跌。\n在美联储透露它可能...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是今天（2021年8月18日，星期三）的市場回顧","the_new_excerpt":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年8月18日，星期三\n\n對不起，沒有亮點，花了較長的時間來寫這一期的回顧報告。\n\n在美聯儲公佈7月會議紀要後，股市在最後兩小時內大跌，基本上是橫盤整理。\n在美聯儲7月會議紀要發佈後，市場出現了暴跌。\n在美聯儲透露它可能...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-aef60dc0-8896-5dcd-8d59-742efe71588e","excerpt":"Revenue of $6.51B beats a $6.33B consensus.\n\nNon-GAAP EPS of $1.04 beats a $1.02 consensus.\n\nFQ3 guiding revenue of $6.8B, plus or minus 2%. above a $6.57B consensus.\n\nData Center segment revenue rose 16% Q/Q and 35% Y/Y to $2.37B, topping a $2.27B\nconsensus.\n\nGaming segment revenue rose 11% Q/Q and…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p6zn4k/nvda_beats_earnings_estimates/","title":"NVDA beats earnings estimates","date":"August 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"NVDA、業績予想を上回る","the_new_excerpt":"売上高は65億1,000万ドルで、コンセンサス6億3,000万ドルを上回りました。\n\n非GAAPベースのEPSは1.04ドルで、コンセンサスの1.02ドルを上回りました。\n\nFQ3のガイダンス収益は68億ドルで、コンセンサスの65.7億ドルをプラスマイナス2％上回る。\n\nデータセンター部門の売上高は、前四半期比16%増、前年同期比35%増の23億7,000万ドルで、コンセンサスの22億7,000万ドルを上回りました。\nコンセンサスを上回りました。\n\nゲーム分野の収益は、前四半期比11％増、前年同期比35％増の23億7,000万ドルとなり、コンセンサスを上回りました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"NVDA超出盈利预期","the_new_excerpt":"收入为65.1亿美元，好于共识的63.3亿美元。\n\n非美国通用会计准则下的每股收益为1.04美元，高于共识的1.02美元。\n\n第三季度指导性收入为68亿美元，正负2%，高于657亿美元的共识。\n\n数据中心业务收入为23.7亿美元，环比增长16%，同比增长35%，高于共识的22.7亿美元。\n共识。\n\n游戏部门的收入环比增长11%，同比增长35%。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"NVDA超出盈利預期","the_new_excerpt":"收入爲65.1億美元，好於共識的63.3億美元。\n\n非美國通用會計準則下的每股收益爲1.04美元，高於共識的1.02美元。\n\n第三季度指導性收入爲68億美元，正負2%，高於657億美元的共識。\n\n數據中心業務收入爲23.7億美元，環比增長16%，同比增長35%，高於共識的22.7億美元。\n共識。\n\n遊戲部門的收入環比增長11%，同比增長35%。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-783ce82b-1909-535d-94c0-8d0e86d54d42","excerpt":"EDIT: I got a lot of great answers - thank you to everyone who replied.
