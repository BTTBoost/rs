There is no employer match. I looked at the plan&amp;#39;s offerings and saw it had Vanguard target index funds with a fee of only .13%. I was excited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my dad had a meeting with the rep to sign up and it turns out his 457 plan adds a fee of .45% and another fee of .65% on top of .13% charged by Vanguard. So the total cost to invest in this Vanguard index fund is 1.23%, whereas you can invest directly with Vanguard for only .13%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the rep actually allocated 90% of the portfolio to an actively managed T Rowe Price target date fund with a final fee of 1.51% because the rep said the T Rowe Price fund had a better performance history than Vanguard. The final 10% the rep allocated to an actively managed REIT with a final fee of 1.98%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel horrible for my dad. Is he getting screwed or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the fees are so high it is my understanding it&amp;#39;s still better for my dad to do this because  of tax advantages. Of course I explained to my dad he should be maxing out his self directed IRA first and then contribute to the 457 plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention the rep for the 457 plan said the average mutual fund cost in the U.S. is 1.5%. Is this actually true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity purpose I was buying whole number of shares within $1,000 in each strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy #1: buy next day (after the show) and sell EOD:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total gain was $1907.38

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the average # of buy recommendations ~$11,500 of capital needed per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~16.59% total gain -&lt;/strong&gt; not bad but below S&amp;amp;500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy #2: buy next day (after the show), hold 5 days and sell EOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total gain was $27,720.31

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the average # of buy recommendations ~$57,500 of capital needed per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48.2% total gain&lt;/strong&gt; - now we are talking business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume they&amp;#39;re storing CPUs and other parts and have modified the Toyota Production System to get around this. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s signs of the shortage ending. Trust Toyota to find a way out of all the car companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought it was an interesting bit of news, maybe they will benefit from this while other automakers struggle to get cars delivered, or maybe they won&amp;#39;t because people are willing to wait for the cars they want&lt;/p&gt;

Wealthfront has me invested in dividends stocks (SCHD) at some nominal percentage (maybe 10% of portfolio) for a taxable account. I had read a post the other day where someone had commented, “why are you investing in dividend ETFs, are you retired?” Is this a consideration? Should I not be in dividend yielding ETFs unless I’m in retirement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: only about 20% of my portfolio is in WF and I manage everything else myself. I just get $40k managed free there and they do tax loss harvesting well. So I’m really wondering if I should be more in on dividend ETFs in my other taxable accounts or prioritizing more toward like VTI (which I’m heavily in as well). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If cannabis is legalized for recreational use, the country - which has a population of more than 83million - could become the biggest cannabis market in the world.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;180-page document lays out coalition&amp;#39;s legislative priorities for next four years&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contained within it is a pledge to legalize cannabis to be sold in licensed shops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10238617/Germany-legalise-CANNABIS-countrys-new-coalition-leaders-announce.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10238617/Germany-legalise-CANNABIS-countrys-new-coalition-leaders-announce.html&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you thoughts on North American companies with cannabis trade to Germany already in place for medical marijuana, like TLRY? Are they going to up the demand a little more as they legalize, or potentially block them out in favor of German growhouses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLTR  CEO Karp made a goofy video last October claiming PLTR has nothing stopping it from going &amp;quot;20x&amp;quot; in price. Then, a month later he dumps $42 million worth of his shares right after the stock had already fallen by about 25%. Basically making it look like he had no faith in his own company after his wild and outlandish claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning Karp was on CNBC. They asked if he was going to stop diluting the shares. He said point blank that dilution would continue in the form of employee compensation. He simply alleged that the stock price would rise despite dilution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me lose faith in PLTR. That and the fact that Karp looks so ridiculous all the time with his uncombed hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if I should cut down to 3 months in the medium risk portfolio for a total of 6 months worth of emergency fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would invest the difference in a more aggressive portfolio for retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or should I just stick with the 9 month emergency fund like I have it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Am leaning towards cashing out the AWP and buying 3-months expenses of i-bonds and keep 3 months cash for spending and small emergencies. I will invest the difference in my 3 fund portfolio. Is this better and adequate?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathie Wood — known for her innovation ETFs that garnered billions in inflows during the pandemic — said Ark Invest is internally testing a fund that takes the strategy a step further by simultaneously betting against major stocks in the benchmarks that are being disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think the benchmarks are where the big risks are long-term because they are filling up with value-traps, those companies that have done very well historically but are going to be disintermediated and disrupted by the massive amount of innovation that’s taking place,” Wood added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like Cathie Wood had found another way to attract investors money. People buying on these ark funds need to understand that the stocks inside are very random. Investors might easily lose money since many of them do not even realize what are they buying and investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an ETF that is shown moving by a few cents at a time, what kind of price action could explain a drop of 21c and then back up 20c in less than a second?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a transaction large enough to move the ETF price that much occurs, how would it not become visible on public charting like Yahoo finance?&lt;/li&gt;

Just a few residual logistical questions to confirm from seasoned users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall context - my family currently holds an emergency fund consisting of 12 months of expenses, in a ‘high yield’ saving account (0.4% right now). My thought is to start building an I bond ladder so that half of the emergency stash is there, with the balance remaining in readily available cash. If anyone thinks this is not a prudent idea for emergency funds I’m happy to understand why or alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After holding an I Bond for the minimum first year, how soon are the funds available (i.e a few business days for the bank transfer)? This is in the context of being emergency funds (and I know I’d lose the three months interest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm the timing of rate transfers, you are guaranteed the current rate for six months from your purchase date, and not up to the next May or November official rate change? For example, if I buy bonds in November, I get the current rate through April. If I buy next April, I’m still guaranteed the current rate through September, because I bought before the May switch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family consists of my spouse and infant child. If I was only interested in buying 20k in bonds per year (right now at least) - would it be logistically more efficient to set up my account and create a linked minor account for my child, to manage everything in one place? Or, safer to set up separate accounts for myself and spouse? I understand that I would have to delink and transfer my child’s holdings back to me while they were still a minor, but I’ve got 17 years until I’d need to worry about that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any insight or tips are appreciated, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Its only two days, but I usually see more of a mixed bag off movement, whereas all the fish are now swimming in the same direction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does make me wonder if this is the cusp of a migration away from long term/growth companies we&amp;#39;ve been expecting. Or maybe it&amp;#39;s just random noise. Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else seeing this trend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: I&amp;#39;m in for the long haul on stocks like this, so I&amp;#39;m not worried, just find it curious and want to know what others think.)&lt;/p&gt;

The general consensus is that this likely will not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,  one thing that *IS* likely to happen - is that the stock price will drop after the dividend date (thus making the above strategy useless). I&amp;#39;m assuming then, and correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong, that the stock price will eventually recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this &amp;quot;recovery&amp;quot; then due to natural stock *growth* or is the recovery some sort of market mechanism specific to dividend stocks where naturally money flows back into the stock after the post-dividend drop? (I&amp;#39;m aware this could be a distinction without a difference)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If recovery for many stocks is inevitable then I&amp;#39;m surprised I haven&amp;#39;t seen much discussion about investment strategies where you purchase the stock after the post-dividend drop? What am I missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANSWERED: The assumption that the stock price will drop after the dividend date or that the stock price will recover is incorrect. Thanks to those who answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Glad to see reddit is as toxic as ever for asking a question - please get some sunshine. I find it astonishing because if you asked a question like this in real life you&amp;#39;d just get a normal answer from a normal person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt the ones making sarky comments are the ones to have little experience in real life social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
