Some people clearly haven&#39;t been investing for a longer period of time (neither have I) and others just don&#39;t deal well with the bad days. </p>\n\n<p>My advice is this: during red periods take a look at your investments and see if anything about the company has changed since you started investing. If there is no significant change why would you sell now?</p>\n\n<p>Second, if you have cash on hand try to incrementally buy shares of your highest conviction stocks or buy those who you think have been hit hardest. </p>\n\n<p>Third, think about the overall state of your portfolio. If it is too focused on one particular section, then consider broadening out your portfolio to different ones so you mitigate risk if you are not comfortable with the current volatility of your portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>The final piece of advice is to just not stare at the graphs everday if you can&#39;t handle looking at the red candles. If you are like me and you are investing for the long-term why would you need to look at the graphs every single day?\nJust grab the stock chart of any stock for a 5 year period and look at the peaks and downturns in stock price. Some stocks lose like 30 percent from one peak before doubling in price compared to that peak and stockholders who held through that downturn eventually got rewarded for their patience. This doesn&#39;t mean that every investment you make will turn out alright in the long-term but panicking and selling at a loss just because the price went down isnt going to make u money especially if nothing about the company changed.</p>\n\n<p>Just today as I write this my portfolio is down about 3 percent while the nasdaq is only down about 0.5 percent. I am not too worried because I am investing with money I don&#39;t necessarily need right now and am investing for the long-term so temporary downturns are only opportunities to add to my highest conviction positions. The point is, if you are investing like me theres no need to panic about what is happening now. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I wish u all good gains in the rest of the year and don&#39;t stress about the market too much, there is more important stuff in life to worry about and we&#39;ve got time on our hands.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: </p>\n\n<p>Also, if you are relatively new to investing and want to learn more, there is alot you can learn just through reading books and practicing doing your own DD on stocks</p>\n\n<p>This post gives a pretty good starting point:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m85sp6/list_of_books_to_read_if_you_want_to_actually/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\">https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m85sp6/list_of_books_to_read_if_you_want_to_actually/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mfxzyn/dont_stress_about_red_days_your_portfolio_being/","title":"Don't stress about red days & your portfolio being down.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-29T21:24:28.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-29 21:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"18196867-54c6-504f-92a3-e269034b80bf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mfxzyn/dont_stress_about_red_days_your_portfolio_being/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mfxzyn/dont_stress_about_red_days_your_portfolio_being/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"alttoby","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/alttoby","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"alttoby","score":973,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不要为红日&你的投资组合下跌而紧张。","the_new_excerpt":"近期市场上抛出的负面情绪很多\n的波动性。有些人显然没有在较长的时间内投资\n时间(我也没有)，而其他人只是不能很好地处理糟糕的日子。\n\n我的建议是：在红色时期，看看你的投资...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"不要爲紅日&你的投資組合下跌而緊張。","the_new_excerpt":"近期市場上拋出的負面情緒很多\n的波動性。有些人顯然沒有在較長的時間內投資\n時間(我也沒有)，而其他人只是不能很好地處理糟糕的日子。\n\n我的建議是：在紅色時期，看看你的投資...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-d1f1e047-ba30-5e51-b0b4-30b8ea6c5b28","excerpt":"I'm new to investing, didn't really do any research into ARKK before I bought it\nat ATH, so I don't really \"trust\" in my initial research, and at this point I'm\nunsure if the fund will recover at a rate that would beat just selling my\npositions in ARKK and buying VOO.\n\nWhat do you think?","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/mfvd8q/at_this_point_do_i_take_the_lesson_on_arkk_and/","title":"At this point, do I take the lesson on ARKK and sell it for VOO?","date":"March 29, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"这时，我是否要吸取ARKK的教训，把它卖给VOO？","the_new_excerpt":"我是投资新手，在买入ARKK之前，并没有真正的研究过它。\n在ATH，所以我对自己最初的研究并不 \"信任\"，此时的我\n不知道该基金是否会以比卖掉我的基金更快的速度恢复。\nARKK的仓位，买入VOO。\n\n你怎么看？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"這時，我是否要吸取ARKK的教訓，把它賣給VOO？","the_new_excerpt":"我是投資新手，在買入ARKK之前，並沒有真正的研究過它。\n在ATH，所以我對自己最初的研究並不 \"信任\"，此時的我\n不知道該基金是否會以比賣掉我的基金更快的速度恢復。\nARKK的倉位，買入VOO。\n\n你怎麼看？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ad1ea17d-2a5d-5233-9450-b0aa0a442bcf","excerpt":"Interested in a stock that I (probably incorrectly) think will take off\ntomorrow.
