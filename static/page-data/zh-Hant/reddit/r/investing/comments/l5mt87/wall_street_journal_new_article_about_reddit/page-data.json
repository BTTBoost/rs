But GameStop Corp. is far from alone in going vertical this year.</p>\n\n<p>Everything from a hydrogen battery maker to a struggling movie-theater chain have rocketed in the past few weeks. Behind the swings, many see ordinary investors, stuck at home in the pandemic, swapping tips and hatching trading strategies on online forums like Reddit’s WallStreetBets—<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/short-bets-pummel-hot-hedge-fund-melvin-capital-11611349217?mod=article_inline\">often buying things Wall Street has bet against</a>. Many <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-day-trading-barbarians-at-the-gate-wont-sack-wall-street-11611660505?mod=article_inline\">tout their long-shot wagers</a> with the expression “YOLO,” or, “You only live once.”</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a look at what else has their attention:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC\"><strong>AMC Entertainment Holdings</strong></a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=chiclets\">AMC <strong>8.71%</strong> </a><strong>Inc</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Shares of the movie-theater operator have risen more than 30% this week after the company <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amc-nets-917-million-in-financing-to-ward-off-bankruptcy-11611574504?mod=article_inline\">announced a $917 million financing deal</a> to avoid filing for bankruptcy. But day traders’ enthusiasm for the company had already allowed it to sell millions of dollars’ worth of shares last year, helping raise much needed cash.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BB\"><strong>BlackBerry</strong></a> <strong>Ltd.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BB?mod=chiclets\">BB <strong>1.50%</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Security software and service provider BlackBerry is another stock with a notable short position finding support online from individual investors. Shares have climbed around 25% this week, leaving many analysts scratching their heads. The company said Monday it wasn’t aware of any material developments or change in its business that would account for the recent jump.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NIO\"><strong>NIO</strong></a> <strong>Inc.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NIO?mod=chiclets\">NIO <strong>-0.43%</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>The Chinese electric-vehicle maker <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-and-discord-are-the-new-wall-street-trading-desks-11610361004\">has received enduring interest</a> from individual traders on social media platforms including Discord and Reddit, sending shares of its ADR up more than 1,000% in the past 12 months. NIO now ranks among the world’s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-and-falland-rise-againof-chinese-ev-startup-nio-11606732206?mod=article_inline\">top five auto makers</a>, with a market capitalization around $96 billion. The company <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/03/2152248/0/en/NIO-Inc-Provides-December-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Delivery-Update.html\">delivered 43,728 vehicles</a> in total last year. That compares to around 449,000 deliveries by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA\">Tesla</a> Inc., <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TSLA?mod=chiclets\">TSLA <strong>0.40%</strong> </a>and more than 9 million from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW\">Volkswagen</a> AG .</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLTR\"><strong>Palantir Technologies</strong></a> <strong>Inc.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLTR?mod=chiclets\">PLTR <strong>-1.27%</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Data-analytics firm Palantir Technologies’ shares have soared over 260% since the company <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-asana-direct-listing-ipo-11601479305?mod=article_inline\">went public back in September</a>, making it one of last year’s best performing stock offerings. The company has also become a favorite of individual investors posting online, who like it because of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-boosts-its-full-year-revenue-outlook-11605220457?mod=article_inline\">exposure to big data and government contracts</a>. Later today, Palantir will show off the latest developments in its software to the public for the first time ever, a move some analysts expect to have positive ramifications for the stock.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLUG\"><strong>Plug Power</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PLUG?mod=chiclets\">PLUG <strong>10.82%</strong> </a><strong>Inc.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Shares of hydrogen battery maker Plug Power have gained more than 370% in the past three months, powered by investors eager to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/major-energy-companies-bet-big-on-hydrogen-11603392160?mod=article_inline\">cash in on the green economy</a>. Individual investors online lauded Plug Power as the next big thing after South Korea-based <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KR/XKRX/034730\">SK Holdings</a> Co. invested $1.5 billion in the company earlier this month. Others are less optimistic, with hedge funds including Kerrisdale Capital Management betting against the stock, saying hydrogen batteries <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-hydrogen-the-new-wonder-fuel-11593170272?mod=article_inline\">face numerous challenges</a> including efficiency and safety.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBBY\"><strong>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</strong></a> <strong>Inc.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BBBY?mod=chiclets\">BBBY <strong>18.42%</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Shares surged as much as 50% Monday before paring gains and are now up around 70% in 2021, even after the home-goods retailer this month <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-posts-quarterly-sales-decline-despite-digital-pickup-11610043338?mod=article_inline\">reported third-quarter earnings</a> per share of 8 cents, short of the 19 cents analysts expected, along with a 5% drop in revenue from the same period last year. Online traders point to an early 2020 change in management and the fact that the company is buying back shares as signs that the share price will continue to increase.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l5mt87/wall_street_journal_new_article_about_reddit/","title":"Wall Street Journal New Article about Reddit Investing - \"BlackBerry, AMC and Other Reddit YOLO Favorites That Aren’t GameStop\"","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T03:08:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 03:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0ce6af64-a423-5607-ad4e-166138df14e4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5mt87/wall_street_journal_new_article_about_reddit/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5mt87/wall_street_journal_new_article_about_reddit/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ConnorPRose","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ConnorPRose","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ConnorPRose","score":121,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"华尔街日报》关于Reddit投资的新文章--\"黑莓、AMC和其他不是GameStop的Reddit YOLO收藏夹\"","the_new_excerpt":"BLACKBERRY、AMC和其他REDDIT YOLO喜爱者，不是GAMESTOP的。\n\n\n网上交易商的法国人让一些公司的股价大涨。\n\n在Reddit论坛上，普通投资者正在交换股票心得。\n\n不仅仅是GameStop。\n\n总部位于德克萨斯州的电子游戏零售商的股价飙升至... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"華爾街日報》關於Reddit投資的新文章--\"黑莓、AMC和其他不是GameStop的Reddit YOLO收藏夾\"","the_new_excerpt":"BLACKBERRY、AMC和其他REDDIT YOLO喜愛者，不是GAMESTOP的。\n\n\n網上交易商的法國人讓一些公司的股價大漲。\n\n在Reddit論壇上，普通投資者正在交換股票心得。\n\n不僅僅是GameStop。\n\n總部位於德克薩斯州的電子遊戲零售商的股價飆升至... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1354202396889673733","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1354202396889673733","title":"The first gazillion-dollar company will be a conglomerate of Tesla, Virgin Galactic, and GameStop.\n\nA self-driving, battery-powered, space-traveling vehicle with gaming on demand.\n\nTicker Symbol?","date":"January 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"第一个价值数十亿美元的公司将是特斯拉、维珍银河和GameStop的联合体。\n\n自动驾驶、电池驱动的太空旅行车，游戏点播。\n\n股票代码？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"第一個價值數十億美元的公司將是特斯拉、維珍銀河和GameStop的聯合體。\n\n自動駕駛、電池驅動的太空旅行車，遊戲點播。\n\n股票代碼？","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-a834b3b4-153f-5214-a38f-49a4fa9f6140","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5jni0/wsb_community_holding_onto_gme_til_1000_against/","title":"WSB community holding onto $GME til $1000 against an army of hedge fund managers","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 27, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WSB社区坚持$GME直到1000美元，对抗对冲基金经理大军。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"WSB社區堅持$GME直到1000美元，對抗對沖基金經理大軍。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-0ce6af64-a423-5607-ad4e-166138df14e4","previousId":"TweetPost-1354202396889673733","nextId":"RedditPost-a834b3b4-153f-5214-a38f-49a4fa9f6140","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l5mt87/wall_street_journal_new_article_about_reddit/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
