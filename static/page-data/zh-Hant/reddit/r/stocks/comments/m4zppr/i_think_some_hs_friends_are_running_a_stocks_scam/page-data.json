I’m almost 100% sure none of them went to any kind of college.</p>\n\n<p>But they’re recently peddling that they are all CEOs of their own investing companies. Every post is either of them engaged in some absurd level of wealth, or encouragement to join their team, or both.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing adds up. The videos they share have the granularity of a Wikipedia article on “stocks” or “forex”. But they’re talking about driving Lamborghinis and buying $300k (ugly) watches. Humble-bragging about making $100k in a day on the markets. They also have official looking articles published about them as entrepreneurs that are just fluff pieces full of generic garbage-positive advice. And they post random pictures or tickers here and there with zero context to their 100k followers. I’m a relatively experienced investor and I really have no idea that they are going on about.</p>\n\n<p>I think it’s a scam. Even if they did know what they were doing in the markets, why not focus on that and why put so much emphasis on displaying their wealth and getting others to join?  All they talk about is mentors. It has all the looks of trying to sell a lifestyle....all the actual millionaires I know wear $20 jeans and drive Honda’s and spend zero time bragging about how much they made or what their strategy is.</p>\n\n<p>Is this some kind of scam? I’ve been looking but I can’t find any information about this, but I have friends that I care about that are looking to join. I just want to know what the point of this scam is so I can try to keep the ones I care about away from it. Thanks in advance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/m4zppr/i_think_some_hs_friends_are_running_a_stocks_scam/","title":"I think some HS friends are running a stocks scam, but I’m not sure what it is.
