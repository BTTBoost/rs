The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.83% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.73% higher, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.09%. Not surprised by this at all, I have been saying for months I remain bullish and have been buying on every dip until the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes.</p>\n\n<p>The Labor Department reported that its Consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased, rose at its slowest pace in six months in August, suggesting that while the inflation rate may remain high for a while due to supply-side constraints, it’s likely the rate of increase has already peaked. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since February and below the 0.3% rise in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI has decreased to 4% from 4.3% in July, an encouraging sign. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI gaining 0.3% and the overall CPI rising 0.4%. It may not seem like it but this is a large month-to-month change.</p>\n\n<p>The Fed&#39;s preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% inflation target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. August&#39;s data will be published later this month.</p>\n\n<p>In global news, new economic data coming out of China suggests the recovery in the second-largest economy is losing steam. Retail sales, a key gauge of Chinese consumer consumption rose just 2.5% year-over-year in August, a massive deceleration from the 8.5% YoY growth recorded in July and a sharply missing estimates of 7% growth. Separate data released Wednesday by the statistics bureau showed home sales by value falling by 19.7% in August from a year ago, the largest drop since April 2020—at the height of the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) released a new generation of products, including the new iPhone 13</li>\n<li>US crude oil prices post rose sharply after the Energy Information Administration report that crude oil inventories declined by 6.4 million barrels last week amid pressure from Hurricane Ida, the lowest level since 2019</li>\n<li>US manufacturing production decelerated in August, likely due to disruption by Hurricane Ida and ongoing supply-side disruptions. The Federal Reserve&#39;s latest data showed manufacturing production rose by just 0.2% in August, or half the gain expected, based on Bloomberg consensus data. Production had risen by 1.6% in July. </li>\n<li>EV-maker Rivian, which is backed by Amazon, hopes to raise as much as $8 billion in an upcoming US IPO.</li>\n<li>One of General Motors Co&#39;s China joint ventures said on Wednesday it is developing auto chips and aims to increase use of locally sourced chips in the next five years.</li>\n<li>Whatsapp, which is owned by Facebook (FB), launched a test of an in-app business directory.</li>\n<li>Volvo is also gearing up for a $20 billion IPO in the coming weeks, according to Reuters. </li>\n<li>Elon Musk-led SpaceX’s Inspiration4 rocket is scheduled to launch an all-civilian crew of four into orbit for three days on Wednesday, a mission that will be streamed live on Netflix (NFLX)</li>\n<li><strong>Sorry no price target upgrades, ran out of time</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>&quot;The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.&quot;</em></strong> <strong>-Eleanor Roosevelt</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/poy1t0/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_sept/","title":"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Sept 15, 2021","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-16T01:38:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-16 01:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"poy1t0","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/poy1t0/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_sept/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/poy1t0/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_wednesday_sept/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"psychotrader00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/psychotrader00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"psychotrader00","score":87,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"本日2021年9月15日（水）のMarket Recapをご紹介します。","the_new_excerpt":"PsychoMarket Recap - 2021年9月15日（水\n\n今日の株価は、以前の損失を取り除いて着実に上昇し、主にエネルギーと産業部門が牽引した。\n市場参加者は、新しい経済指標や米国のコロナウイルスの状況を確認しながら、エネルギーや産業部門を中心に上昇しました。\nこれは、市場参加者が新しい経済指標や米国のコロナウイルスの状況を理解したことによるものです。S&P 500 (SPY)\nは、0.83%の上昇で終了しました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"以下是今天（2021年9月15日，星期三）的市场回顾","the_new_excerpt":"心理市场回顾 - 2021年9月15日，星期三\n\n今天股市稳步上涨，摆脱了早些时候的损失，最近主要是由以下因素推动的\n主要由能源和工业部门推动，因为市场参与者消化了新的\n经济数据和美国的冠状病毒情况。标准普尔500指数（SPY\n收涨0.83%...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"以下是今天（2021年9月15日，星期三）的市場回顧","the_new_excerpt":"心理市場回顧 - 2021年9月15日，星期三\n\n今天股市穩步上漲，擺脫了早些時候的損失，最近主要是由以下因素推動的\n主要由能源和工業部門推動，因爲市場參與者消化了新的\n經濟數據和美國的冠狀病毒情況。標準普爾500指數（SPY\n收漲0.83%...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pp05we","excerpt":"What advice would you have for a boglehead strategy for $5M.
