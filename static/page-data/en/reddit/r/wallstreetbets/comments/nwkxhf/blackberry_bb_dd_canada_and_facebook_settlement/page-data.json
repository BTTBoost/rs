Just a question about how you&#39;re hoping to structure the deal for the patent sale. Should we expect ongoing royalties to come from, maybe you get a portion of the licensing fees that you are -- that the buyer will take or is this more of a one-time deal?</code></p>\n\n<p><code>John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</code></p>\n\n<p><code>There is a majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on. I can&#39;t give you the details of this, but for multiple number of years.</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Okay, now you mentioned in the past that you&#39;ve had offers for the entire portfolio. So what&#39;s different now that&#39;s making you consider selling it.</code></p>\n\n<p><code>John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</code></p>\n\n<p><code>There re two reasons. Number one is, I really think it is a wrong thing to sell the entire portfolio because there is so much of our -- we have an ongoing business in cybersecurity and an ongoing business in BTS which of course includes IVY and QNX. I think selling those portfolio will be extremely unwise for the company and for the shareholders.</code></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>3) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&amp;t=2851s\">Tail revenue is up to SEVEN years (@47:31).</a></p>\n\n<p><code>John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Yeah. Paul, that&#39;s a good question. So this is an unusual year. So let&#39;s talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.</code></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>All of this is huge.
