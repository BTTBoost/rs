Many of you might even have stopped eating crayons or worse: sold your $GME stocks with huge losses. </p>\n\n<p>I want to use this chance to tell you that not all is lost. Nothing is lost (until you sell in fact!). Of course I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about - I&#39;m really no one to trust in financial advice, so be aware. </p>\n\n<p>But still I am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining. Trends in stocks need corrections, that&#39;s basic DOW-theory. And how much do they correct in general? A 0.5 Fib-retracement correction is very usual in almost all trends. They even sometimes correct a fib-retracement below. </p>\n\n<p>So when you&#39;re looking at my chart now (very fancy, colors!, buy!) you will see that we&#39;re pretty exact around that retracement now. Furthermore price tried to go under EMA50 but directly went up again to the exact position of EMA50. Where are we now?  Correct, almost at EMA50 but NOT below. This is a hell of a resistance and we&#39;re not letting it fall below my fellow apes!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore EMA100 and EMA200 are still showing upward movement, which is also good. </p>\n\n<p>Last but not least MACD aims for its zero-line and might turn positive. You ask when? Hm, if you look at the MACD trend it might be tomorrow, Friday 03/19 (and we are all hoping for a beginning squeeze on that day, don&#39;t we?!)</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, from my perspective everything is still fine. For disclosure, I&#39;m stuck in the upper 300s in GME, and I won&#39;t sell before we reach at least four digits! </p>\n\n<p>TL:DR: Trend is still fine, EMA50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement tomorrow, Friday 03/19 or coming Monday. I like the stock and you should like it too. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rwn267m02un61.png?width=2091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09182b5399332de89d5a0db97254e1762fad8278\">My technical analysis on $GME</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7ya85/why_i_think_gme_is_still_bullish_and_going_to_moon/","title":"Why I think $GME is still bullish and going to moon","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-19T04:22:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-19 04:22","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"624f52bf-19c9-5327-baa6-d3ad1b7b1855","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7ya85/why_i_think_gme_is_still_bullish_and_going_to_moon/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7ya85/why_i_think_gme_is_still_bullish_and_going_to_moon/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/SlAGll0TZ7A7CVmxsmfjqqSBOuWE-b8_Upw8JTcYCAg.png?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0184605306e5ee2fd75c7be78ac4790615e62695","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"the_ciclon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_ciclon","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"the_ciclon","score":2370,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么我认为$GME依然牛气冲天，走向月球？","the_new_excerpt":"同胞们，我知道你们中的许多人，包括我在内，都经历过一些艰难的日子。\n和小时。你们中的许多人甚至可能已经停止了吃蜡笔，或者更糟糕的是：卖了\n你的$GME股票损失惨重。\n\n我想利用这个机会告诉大家，并不是所有的事情都会失去。没有什么是失去的\n直到你卖掉！）。的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼我認爲$GME依然牛氣沖天，走向月球？","the_new_excerpt":"同胞們，我知道你們中的許多人，包括我在內，都經歷過一些艱難的日子。\n和小時。你們中的許多人甚至可能已經停止了喫蠟筆，或者更糟糕的是：賣了\n你的$GME股票損失慘重。\n\n我想利用這個機會告訴大家，並不是所有的事情都會失去。沒有什麼是失去的\n直到你賣掉！）。的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-53e1bc18-302b-53ec-9879-a181b5ac7cdc","excerpt":"> FIFO (first in first out) ----> Sells your oldest shares first\n> \n> LIFO (last in first out) ----> Sells your most recently purchased shares first\n> \n> Highest Cost ----> Sells your shares with the highest cost basis first\n> \n> Low Cost ----> Sells your shares with the lowest average first\n\nDollar…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/m86yjx/tax_lots_and_how_to_use_them_better_explained/","title":"TAX LOTS and how to use them, better explained...","date":"March 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"税额和如何使用税额，更好的解释... ...","the_new_excerpt":"> FIFO(先进先出) ----> 先卖出您最老的股票。\n> \n> LIFO（后进先出）----> 先卖出您最近买入的股票。\n> \n> 最高成本 ----> 先卖出成本最高的股票。\n> \n> 低成本----> 以最低的平均价格先卖出你的股票。\n\n美元...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"稅額和如何使用稅額，更好的解釋... ...","the_new_excerpt":"> FIFO(先進先出) ----> 先賣出您最老的股票。\n> \n> LIFO（後進先出）----> 先賣出您最近買入的股票。\n> \n> 最高成本 ----> 先賣出成本最高的股票。\n> \n> 低成本----> 以最低的平均價格先賣出你的股票。\n\n美元...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-4aaf8a24-f1b3-5f06-aea8-531a5597d6db","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m862k3/4100_put_contracts_pretty_dumb_but_i_believe_i/","title":"4,100 PUT contracts, pretty dumb but I believe I narrowed the next market crash to this week.
