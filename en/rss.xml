&lt;p&gt;Chinese regulators have asked Didi Global Inc.’s top executives to devise a plan to delist from U.S. bourses, people familiar with the matter said, an unprecedented request that’s likely to revive fears about Beijing’s intentions for its giant tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s tech watchdog wants management to take the company off the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said.  Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesday’s close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didi’s biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo. Deliberations continue and it’s possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijing’s municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company’s U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies Inc. are Didi’s biggest minority shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag.

&lt;p&gt;Regulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the world’s largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms’ books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinping’s administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or “common prosperity,” has targeted an internet sector that’s accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didi’s stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the country’s internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in China’s largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi’s IPO decision as a challenge to the central government’s authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi’s offices in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that’s traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel has the money and talent especially with Raja Koduri leading the Graphics department to become highly competitive with Nvidia if not a leader in the market. Intel will also have the advantage of using their new fabs in the future to produce their GPU&amp;#39;s whereas Nvidia will be reliant on TSMC/Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AMD also becoming more competitive and both Intel and AMD not being as limited to just the GPU market unlike Nvidia, should people be worried that Nvidia may have to lower profit margins and suffer from lower growth that could make their current price look extremely high?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DraftKings is regarded as one of the current leaders of the sports gambling indus- try. The company, since its founding in 2012, has obtained lucrative partnering agree- ments with the biggest players in sports and entertainment, establishing contracts with MLB, NFL, NASCAR, UFC, ESPN, 21st Century Fox Sports, and Bleacher Report. DraftK- ings offers live daily fantasy contests for over 13 sports. The online sports gambling in- dustry has huge growth potential, which has yielded a large number of competitors to spring up, such as Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ: $PENN), fuboTV (NYSE: $FUBO), and Flutter Entertainment (OTCMKTS: $PDYPY). Despite the lure of the sports gambling industry, the bearish case for DraftKings lies in waiting for a further correction before in- vesting due to competitive pressure, limited growth, and their profitability track record.
The quality of services is critical in determining the long-term growth and customer retainment for a firm, especially within the gaming sector. DraftKings’ narrow yet compact focus on live online sports betting limits their presence in the overall gam- bling industry, as opposed to other firms such as Penn National Gaming, which employs a generalist approach to available services. Penn, in addition to sports and casino style bet- ting, is a large operator of casino and resort locations. This versatility in gambling ser- vices could provide greater growth in a post-COVID world less reliant on virtual gaming, which DraftKings does not offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures dropped in early morning trading on Friday as investors geared up for a shortened trading day amid renewed Covid fears over a new variant found in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800 points, while those for the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were also in in negative territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downward moves came after WHO officials on Thursday warned of a new Covid-19 variant that&amp;#39;s been detected in South Africa. The United Kingdom temporarily suspended flights from six African countries due to the variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond yields tumbled amid the flight to safety. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.5380%, a sharp reversal after surging above 1.65% earlier this week. Bond yields move inversely to prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil prices also tumbled, with U.S. crude futures down 6.2% to $73.57 per barrel, while the South African rand weakened 1.7% against the greenback to 16.231 per dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asia markets were hit hard in Friday trade, with Japan&amp;#39;s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong&amp;#39;s Hang Seng index both falling more than 2% each.&lt;/p&gt;

Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney declined. U.S. markets were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Austria imposed a nationwide 10-day lockdown after its daily virus deaths tripled, while Italy imposed curbs on activity by unvaccinated people. The U.S. government advised Americans to avoid travel to Germany and Denmark. Scientists in South Africa said a new variant was spreading among young people in its most populous province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Investors are likely to shoot first and ask questions later until more is known,” Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index CN:SHCOMP lost 0.6% to 3,560.15 and the Nikkei 225 JP:NIK NIY00 in Tokyo plunged by an unusually wide 2.8% margin to 28,656.17. The Hang Seng HK:HSI in Hong Kong tumbled 2.3% to 24,161.55. The Kospi KR:180721 in Seoul lost 1.4% to 2,938.09 and Sydney’s S&amp;amp;P-ASX 200 AU:XJO fell 1.7% to 7,279. New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets also declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street’s benchmark S&amp;amp;P 500 SPX closed up 0.2% on Wednesday. U.S. markets are due to reopen Friday for a shortened post-Thanksgiving trading session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;B.1.1.529, to be named Nu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 mutations in spike protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earliest known case: South Africa, Nov. 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fears it could be more transmissible, evade immunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK &amp;amp; Israel impose travel bans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SA reports 2,465 new cases, up 321% from last week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According here &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drericding/status/1463998740340121601?s=21&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/drericding/status/1463998740340121601?s=21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost double the mutations as delta&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was vaccine resistant as people tested were double vaccinated with Pfizer (but did not have 3rd booster) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHO already emergency meeting and UK and Israel have shut down flights coming from 6 nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest issue is that the new variant is VACCINE RESISTANT which seems awful long term unless people are really going to attempt to get us to take brand new vaccine shots in 3-4 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t contribute enough to my Roth this year and want to reach the $6000 maximum. The problem is that my income went into my brokerage and I’m concerned about how it may look to the IRS if I withdraw money from my brokerage and deposit into my Roth. This money would not be in surplus to what I deposited into my brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS website just says that the money used to fund it has to be earned wages, but doesn’t go into further depth. Is it still “earned” if I’m just withdrawing money that I had earned and churned through some day trades? Am I over thinking this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s tech watchdog wants management to take the company off the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added. If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesday’s close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didi’s biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deliberations continue and it’s possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijing’s municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company’s U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies Inc. are Didi’s biggest minority shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the world’s largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms’ books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinping’s administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or “common prosperity,” has targeted an internet sector that’s accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didi’s stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the country’s internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in China’s largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi’s IPO decision as a challenge to the central government’s authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi’s offices in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that’s traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys are basically pre-revenue, but they have spent the last few years making a water filtration system for PFAS&amp;#39;s. If the stars align just right with the EPA declaring PFAS a hazardous material and their tech works as advertised they are looking to lead a $180B industry. They also have a consumer product releasing soon called Pooph. It&amp;#39;s an anti smell cleaning product which could bring in a good amount of steady revenue in 2022.

In general for you own portion of capital in a sector you will defer to the opinion of the &amp;#39;specialist&amp;#39; on where to invest it, and they to you for whatever you specialize in. There are also friends who follow along with us but do not have the time to research anything and so do not provide insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got us thinking, wouldn&amp;#39;t it be convenient to just pool our money in a club and let everyone handle their specialty independently but the effects would be felt collectively. John handles all the healthcare investments, Brian the banking, Steve the tech, etc. From what I have read on investment clubs its pretty clear that those who would actually manage investments can all form a club together and we wouldn&amp;#39;t need any sort of licensing. The question comes in with the silent members who do not research or invest themselves. If we had 4 people making the decisions and 6 whose money was in the partnership but they made no input, would this mean the 4 &amp;#39;managers&amp;#39; need licensing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if we were to divide the partnership in a way that the active members received more through ownership means, would this break the rules for an investment club? Ex: Brain and Steve form an investment club and both contribute $50,000. Brain manages and makes all investment decisions so he gets a 60% interest in the LLC while Steve gets 40%. From my own understanding and research it seems this should be allowed under &amp;#39;sweat equity&amp;#39; rules but I know investing is subject to special stipulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, I am aware of the old &amp;#39;never invest your friends money&amp;#39; saying but we are all adults&amp;#39; with experience and this represents a tiny fraction of each of our net worth&amp;#39;s. Appreciate any input!&lt;/p&gt;
