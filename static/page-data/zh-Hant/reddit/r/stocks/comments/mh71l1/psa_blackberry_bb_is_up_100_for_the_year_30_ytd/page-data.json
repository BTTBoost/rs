Why do they think their &quot;misunderstood&quot; technology isn&#39;t valued in? There&#39;s a chip shortage and $BB needs chips to make money.

That&#39;s pretty good for a stock that always misses out on revenue. And since they need chips to be successful during a chip shortage, I think this stock stays flat or even dips further for the year. But to finish 50-100% for the year is still a nice year.
