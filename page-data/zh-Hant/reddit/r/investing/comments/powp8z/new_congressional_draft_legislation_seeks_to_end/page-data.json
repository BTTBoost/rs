It would take effect in tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2022. Wyden said in a statement Tuesday that, “This proposal exempts retirement accounts entirely.”</p>\n\n<p>Wyden’s proposal was made before his committee delivers its draft of tax measures for inclusion in the budget-reconciliation bill that will form the bulk of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda.</p>\n\n<p>The effort would address an advantage for ETFs that stems from a law dating back to the Nixon administration. The law exempts so-called regulated investment companies, or RICs, from recognizing a taxable gain on assets if shareholders are paid out “in kind.” In other words, if withdrawing investors are paid in securities like stocks rather than in cash.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ETFs are structured so that money flows in and out via facilitators known as authorized participants, and redemptions for a fund almost always take place in-kind. That means that if there are enough withdrawals, an ETF can avoid recognizing taxable gains entirely. Rather than paying a tax on a fund’s gains each year, investors usually don’t pay anything until they sell their ETF.</strong></p>\n\n<p>“Because ETFs are pass-through vehicles, by definition every cent of the increased tax flows through directly to the shareholders -- not all of whom are filthy rich,” Jeremy I. Senderowicz at law firm Vedder Price said by email.</p>\n\n<p>Some ETF managers use so-called heartbeat trades to increase the amount of withdrawals and erase all of a fund’s taxable gains. A friendly bank moves a pile of cash into a fund before almost immediately pulling it out, allowing the ETF to shed stocks that have gone up in value without incurring a taxable gain.</p>\n\n<p>“This particular proposal simply applies the same rules already in place for corporations to regulated investment companies, so wealthy investors can no longer avoid all tax on their gains,” Wyden said in his statement Tuesday. “We’re only talking about the taxable accounts of the wealthiest investors.”</p>\n\n<p>A summary of Wyden’s proposal mentions heartbeat transactions in particular, although he proposes to erase the entire provision that allows RICs to avoid recognizing gains. The proposal “would repeal the exception for RICs, aligning RICs with the general requirement that gain be recognized upon distribution by a corporation of built-in gain property,” the summary said.</p>\n\n<p>That’s a potential industry game-changer. While ETFs tend to have several advantages over mutual funds -- like the ability to trade all day and generally lower fees -- research has shown the tax loophole is a key driver in the long-term trend of cash flowing from mutual funds into ETFs. As that has gathered pace, U.S. issuers are this year for the first time directly converting mutual fund assets into ETFs.</p>\n\n<p>The final package of tax hikes, including ones on corporations and wealthy individuals, may takes weeks to develop.</p>\n\n<p>“Wyden right now is coming up with his own provisions that could fit into that” final legislation, said Nathan Dean, a government analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of this as something to have in his hip pocket when the Democrats start negotiating.”</p>\n\n<p>The odds may be against the ETF-related legislation ever passing, Dean said. First, because so much negotiation is still ahead, and second because it would directly impact ETFs, which are very popular with consumers. However, with so much currently up for discussion, it could slip through as a smaller provision not well-understood by lawmakers, he said. </p>\n\n<p>Senderowicz thinks the legislation has a low chance of succeeding because of the potential damage to many small investors -- but he also doesn’t rule it out.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s impossible to disguise the incidence of the tax increase and thus lends itself well to political attacks,” said Senderowicz. “But if it’s a choice between it and the entire reconciliation bill coming apart?”</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/powp8z/new_congressional_draft_legislation_seeks_to_end/","title":"New congressional draft legislation seeks to end tax efficiency of all ETFs","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-15T23:22:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-15 23:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"powp8z","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/powp8z/new_congressional_draft_legislation_seeks_to_end/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/powp8z/new_congressional_draft_legislation_seeks_to_end/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"cefpodoxime","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cefpodoxime","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cefpodoxime","score":83,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"すべてのETFの税効率を廃止しようとする米国議会の新法案","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/etf-industry-risks-losing-key-tax-edge-as-democrat-whets-knife\n\nここ数日、企業や富裕層への増税を目的とした米国議会の提案に関するニュースが数多く報じられています。\nここ数日、企業や富裕層への増税を目的とした米国議会の提案が話題になっています。\nそれは、一般の投資家にも影響を与えるもので、潜在的には...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"国会新的立法草案试图终止所有ETF的税收效率","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/etf-industry-risks-losing-key-tax-edge-as-democrat-whets-knife\n\n在过去的几天里，关于国会提案的头条新闻层出不穷。\n在过去几天里，关于国会提高公司和富人税收的大量头条新闻中，有一条将影响普通投资者\n潜在地影响到普通投资者...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"國會新的立法草案試圖終止所有ETF的稅收效率","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/etf-industry-risks-losing-key-tax-edge-as-democrat-whets-knife\n\n在過去的幾天裏，關於國會提案的頭條新聞層出不窮。\n在過去幾天裏，關於國會提高公司和富人稅收的大量頭條新聞中，有一條將影響普通投資者\n潛在地影響到普通投資者...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-poye62","excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/lockheed-martin-secures-242-billion-in-pentagon-contracts-for-f-35-fighter-jet-program/ar-AAOrII7?ocid=uxbndlbing\n\nThe Department of Defense this week awarded contracts valued at over $2.01\nbillion to Lockheed Martin Corp. to continue making and maintaining the…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/poye62/lockheed_martin_secures_2_billion_in_pentagon/","title":"Lockheed Martin secures $2 billion in Pentagon contracts for F-35 fighter jet program","date":"September 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ロッキード・マーチン社、F-35戦闘機プログラムで米国防総省から20億ドルの契約を獲得","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/lockheed-martin-secures-242-billion-in-pentagon-contracts-for-f-35-fighter-jet-program/ar-AAOrII7?ocid=uxbndlbing\n\n米国防総省は今週、ロッキード・マルティネス社に20億1,000万ドル以上の契約を発注しました。\nロッキード・マーチン社に20億1,000万ドルを超える契約を発注しました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"洛克希德-马丁公司为F-35战斗机项目获得五角大楼20亿美元的合同","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/lockheed-martin-secures-242-billion-in-pentagon-contracts-for-f-35-fighter-jet-program/ar-AAOrII7?ocid=uxbndlbing\n\n美国国防部本周授予洛克希德-马丁公司价值超过20.1亿美元的合同\n洛克希德-马丁公司的合同，以继续制造和维护...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"洛克希德-馬丁公司爲F-35戰鬥機項目獲得五角大樓20億美元的合同","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/lockheed-martin-secures-242-billion-in-pentagon-contracts-for-f-35-fighter-jet-program/ar-AAOrII7?ocid=uxbndlbing\n\n美國國防部本週授予洛克希德-馬丁公司價值超過20.1億美元的合同\n洛克希德-馬丁公司的合同，以繼續製造和維護...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pp0byb","excerpt":"If there's any bright spot, it's the I only started with 15k at the start of\nCovid.
