Among those 175 million legacy cars, about 5 dollars per licensing fee, that is the reason why BB stock price was so low in the past years.  </p>\n\n<p>2, But with the blackberry gene of safety, security and mobility, of course with the Iso 26262 and safety highest level, link is following <a href=\"https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications\">https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications</a>,  qnx is embedded in Qualcomm and NVIDIA with long time partnership. So blackberry consolidate ability of the communication and computing, and control the first hand data generated inside the cars.</p>\n\n<p>Some guys don&#39;t believe qnx as OS is working on  nvidia, please Google It. It is official declaration in 2018.  Link is this <a href=\"https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform\">https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform</a></p>\n\n<p>3,  with those first hand data, blackberry is a emerging big data company, so the exclusive partnership with Amazon lead to the blackberry Ivy platform which will be provided to the carmakers based on a subscription monthly fee, and which would be 55 split between blackberry and Amazon. </p>\n\n<p>4,  why carmaker would need this blackberry Ivy platform? In coming future all carmakers will be a fleet of cars, all cars would be sold at costs and carmakers will survive from the subscription fee from the carowners. Link is here from the boss of the NVIDIA, <a href=\"https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nvidia-ceo-says-software-will-soon-define-car-drive-profit\">https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nvidia-ceo-says-software-will-soon-define-car-drive-profit</a></p>\n\n<p>5, the recurring subscription fee from carmakers will be only a part of the recurring revenue for  blackberry, there is another recurring revenue from the cyber security section which is now wp. 29 (link follows <a href=\"https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/regulations/wp-29-vehicle-cybersecurity/\">https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/regulations/wp-29-vehicle-cybersecurity/</a>),  and beyond that is  ISO/SAE 21434 which is a totally new still under draft, and cross standards of the connected cars. </p>\n\n<p>If someday Tesla declare that they will cooperate with blackberry, that is the necessary step from my view. </p>\n\n<p>Think further and look forward, all the automotive industry will be inspired and reinvented by Tesla, such as  by creating new business mode. </p>\n\n<p>But for the specific function of the car especially for the passenger use, it replys on the safety and security heavily which is a policy and regulation oriented, HUGE MOAT. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l42np2/dd_for_bb_why_i_think_bb_would_be_a_200_billion/","title":"DD for bb, Why I think BB would be a 200 billion company eventually","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T19:30:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 19:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ff3aeccd-928d-582b-987e-f7e5fa14d4b7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l42np2/dd_for_bb_why_i_think_bb_would_be_a_200_billion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l42np2/dd_for_bb_why_i_think_bb_would_be_a_200_billion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Eastern_Rich_4739","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Eastern_Rich_4739","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Eastern_Rich_4739","score":247,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"DD为bb，为什么我认为bb最终会成为一家2000亿的公司？","the_new_excerpt":"1、黑莓qnx RTOS已安装在全球超过1.75亿辆汽车上，但\n这不是经常性的收入，而是按授权费逐件销售。\n在这1.75亿辆传统汽车中，每辆授权费约5元，也就是\n过去几年BB股价如此低迷的原因。\n\n2,…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"DD爲bb，爲什麼我認爲bb最終會成爲一家2000億的公司？","the_new_excerpt":"1、黑莓qnx RTOS已安裝在全球超過1.75億輛汽車上，但\n這不是經常性的收入，而是按授權費逐件銷售。\n在這1.75億輛傳統汽車中，每輛授權費約5元，也就是\n過去幾年BB股價如此低迷的原因。\n\n2,…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-de356877-5342-557f-92ed-edc3c6920a39","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l415gc/deepfuckingvalue_perspective_from_july_2020_60k/","title":"DeepFuckingValue Perspective from July 2020 (-60k) to today","date":"January 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"从2020年7月(-6万)到今天的DeepFuckingValue展望","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"從2020年7月(-6萬)到今天的DeepFuckingValue展望","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-dd10c262-b1f8-5e45-a807-81a194799b4b","excerpt":"GameStop and Autism Speaks award up to $250,000 in NXT GEN Coders Program Grants\nto increase employment readiness of people with autism\n[https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-and-autism-speaks-award-250000-nxt-gen-coders-program]\n\nApparently they changed their…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3xcut/apparently_gamestop_knew_about_this_sub_before/","title":"Apparently, GameStop knew about this sub before you Autistics knew about them...","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 24, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"显然，GameStop在你们这些自闭症患者知道之前就已经知道了这个子... ...","the_new_excerpt":"GameStop和自闭症之声颁发高达25万美元的NXT GEN编纂者计划补助金。\n增加自闭症患者的就业准备；\n[https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-and-autism-speaks-award-250000-nxt-gen-coders-program]\n\n显然，他们改变了他们的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"顯然，GameStop在你們這些自閉症患者知道之前就已經知道了這個子... ...","the_new_excerpt":"GameStop和自閉症之聲頒發高達25萬美元的NXT GEN編纂者計劃補助金。\n增加自閉症患者的就業準備；\n[https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-and-autism-speaks-award-250000-nxt-gen-coders-program]\n\n顯然，他們改變了他們的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ff3aeccd-928d-582b-987e-f7e5fa14d4b7","previousId":"RedditPost-de356877-5342-557f-92ed-edc3c6920a39","nextId":"RedditPost-dd10c262-b1f8-5e45-a807-81a194799b4b","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l42np2/dd_for_bb_why_i_think_bb_would_be_a_200_billion/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
