Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people&#39;s attention. I think it&#39;s worth looking further to see what&#39;s out there.</p>\n\n<p>Starting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP\">https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP</a> . &quot;Growth at a Reasonable Price&quot; (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or &quot;TTM&quot; net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP&#39;s historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It&#39;s designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Moving on to Factor ETFs,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL\">https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL</a> .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.</p></li>\n<li><p>FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA\">https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA</a> .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.</p></li>\n<li><p>JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753\">https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753</a> .  JVAL&#39;s index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.</p></li>\n<li><p>FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal\">https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal</a> .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they&#39;re less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity&#39;s offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger&#39;s favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.</p></li>\n<li><p>JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, <a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761\">https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761</a> .  JPMorgan handles &quot;quality&quot; a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They&#39;re grouped into categories for &quot;profitability&quot;, &quot;solvency and financial risk&quot;, and &quot;earnings quality&quot;.  Loosely stated, they&#39;re looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let us not forget commodities,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, <a href=\"https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf\">https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf</a> .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it&#39;s almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and &quot;flat&quot; (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.</p></li>\n<li><p>CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund\">https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund</a> .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Seeking dividends?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, <a href=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy\">https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy</a> . A new offering from Schwab, it&#39;s the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Finally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, <a href=\"https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html\">https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html</a> .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I&#39;m including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it&#39;s volatile.  And it&#39;s not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can&#39;t be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it&#39;s actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK&#39;s funds.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Disclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/nprdln/10_more_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less/","title":"10 more interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-01T12:32:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-01 12:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"bffb5513-1701-5fa8-b8ad-f3b7bf502499","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nprdln/10_more_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nprdln/10_more_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"pmchem","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pmchem","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"pmchem","score":1297,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"AUMが10億ドル未満の、より興味深く有用な10のETF","the_new_excerpt":"AUMが1億ドル未満の面白くて役に立つETF10選」の続編として、今回は\n今回は、AUMが10億ドルに満たないものの、私が面白いと思うETFを10本紹介します。\nまた、それぞれのETFについてのコメントも掲載します。往々にして、最大手のETFや人気のあるETFだけが人々の注目を集めます。\n人気のあるETFだけが注目されることがよくあります。私が思うに、それは価値のあることです...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"10只资产管理规模低于10亿美元的更有趣和有用的ETFs","the_new_excerpt":"作为 \"10只资产管理规模低于10亿美元的有趣和有用的ETF \"的续篇，我又回来了。\n还有10只资产管理规模低于10亿美元的ETF，但我认为它们很有趣\n和可能有用的ETF，以及对每个ETF的一些评论。很多时候，只有最大的ETF或最受欢迎的ETF才会得到人们的关注。\n或最受欢迎的ETF才会得到人们的关注。我认为这很值得...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"10只資產管理規模低於10億美元的更有趣和有用的ETFs","the_new_excerpt":"作爲 \"10只資產管理規模低於10億美元的有趣和有用的ETF \"的續篇，我又回來了。\n還有10只資產管理規模低於10億美元的ETF，但我認爲它們很有趣\n和可能有用的ETF，以及對每個ETF的一些評論。很多時候，只有最大的ETF或最受歡迎的ETF纔會得到人們的關注。\n或最受歡迎的ETF纔會得到人們的關注。我認爲這很值得...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ea39badb-c3be-594e-8997-4f5a9cf78ce3","excerpt":"Lately, I have been browsing the new sections of a few investing subreddits, and\nI came to the conclusion that a lot of us are in need of education on basic\nconcepts that don't relate solely to stocks.\n\nI strongly believe that everyone that owns stocks should have at least a basic\nunderstanding of…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/npaty6/the_investors_skills_and_knowledge_musthaves/","title":"The Investor's Skills and Knowledge Must-Haves","date":"June 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投資家のスキルと知識の必需品","the_new_excerpt":"最近、いくつかの投資系サブレディットの新しいセクションを閲覧していて\n私たちの多くは、株だけではなく、基本的な概念の教育を必要としているという結論に達しました。\n株に限らず、基本的な概念の教育が必要だと思いました。\n\n私は、株を持っている人は、少なくとも以下の基本的な理解を持っているべきだと強く信じています。\n理解すべきだと思います。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"投资者必须具备的技能和知识","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我一直在浏览一些投资子网站的新栏目，并且\n我得出的结论是，我们中的很多人都需要接受基本的教育。\n我得出的结论是，我们中的很多人都需要接受基本概念的教育，而这些概念并不只与股票有关。\n\n我坚信，每个拥有股票的人都应该至少有一个基本的\n的基本了解...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資者必須具備的技能和知識","the_new_excerpt":"最近，我一直在瀏覽一些投資子網站的新欄目，並且\n我得出的結論是，我們中的很多人都需要接受基本的教育。\n我得出的結論是，我們中的很多人都需要接受基本概念的教育，而這些概念並不只與股票有關。\n\n我堅信，每個擁有股票的人都應該至少有一個基本的\n的基本瞭解...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e782e67c-010c-528d-8a00-75f16ef7fdd2","excerpt":"> Nvidia has unveiled the latest graphics cards\n> [https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-graphics-cards-3] in its RTX 30-series\n> — the RTX 3080 Ti and the RTX 3070 Ti.\n> \n> The RTX 3080 Ti will launch on June 3rd for $1,199.
