The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi#:%7E:text=SoFi%20was%20founded%20in%202011,debt%20to%20fund%20their%20education\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi#:~:text=SoFi%20was%20founded%20in%202011,debt%20to%20fund%20their%20education</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am just a big believer in bringing personal finances to the masses and to teach people about personal finance and how to accumulate and build wealth, most parents and schools don’t teach shit on the subject matter. I absolutely love SoFi&#39;s statements/mantras:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Our number one goal is helping our members get their money right. </p></li>\n<li><p>SoFi&#39;s mission is to help people reach financial independence to realize their ambitions.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s go over some #s.  SoFi has been around and growing as a private company for some time now and has seen seven consecutive quarters of YoY growth w Q1 2021 producing 110% growth and ending w 2.281M members.  This is exponential to say the very least.</p>\n\n<p>I will be linking the data and numbers, but that is all readily available for all the see and find.  The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YoY respectively.  The biggest factors to me are they are scaling and accumulating data.  These 2 things are what are going to set companies apart to not only produce growth but obtain profitability to the bottom line. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of SoFi is to be the one-stop shop for everything a person would need for finance.  Checking/savings accounts, personal loans, home loans, student loans, car loans, budgeting, investing in the markets, and on and on.  The total products used by members has grown by 121% YoY and financial products has grown 273% YoY.  It appears to this layman that they are figuring out to how grow members as well as total products used by member.  <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sofis-q1-earnings-beat-managements-guidance-as-company-prepares-to-trade-on-nasdaq-2021-05\">https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sofis-q1-earnings-beat-managements-guidance-as-company-prepares-to-trade-on-nasdaq-2021-05</a></p>\n\n<p>SoFi acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp Inc in its quest to get a federal bank charter, which is cumbersome and tedious process.  This would be an upcoming catalyst for sure if/when this happens <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/sofi-s-bank-buy-presents-blueprint-for-more-fintech-bank-deals-63129976\">https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/sofi-s-bank-buy-presents-blueprint-for-more-fintech-bank-deals-63129976</a></p>\n\n<p>The Galileo acquisition was a game changer and covered well by <a href=\"/u/havocs2\">u/havocs2</a> in his DD, I would just add that this has seen 130% YoY (everything seems to be growing triple digits) growth as well. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/</a> </p>\n\n<p>$SoFi was brought to market under the SPAC model and coverage of the stonk has just began.  Coverage was initiated by Oppenheimer w an outperform and was also initiated by Rosenblatt w a buy.  TipRanks has it rated as moderate buy and a price target of $27.50, about a 40% premium to today&#39;s closing price.  <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast\">https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast</a></p>\n\n<p>I am not a bot, nor am I a shill.  I am very active (to fucking active to be honest) in the daily and I post almost all my plays in real time.  Check my post history and you can see that I have been in this play for some time and believe in the company.</p>\n\n<p>Current positions: 5 $12.50 2023 LEAPS, 2 $20.00 2023 LEAPS, and 155 shares and no intention of dumping or selling short term.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a high SI? is the borrow rate high? Was this targeted because it was a Chamath SPAC?  Probably, i don&#39;t know for sure and honestly don&#39;t give 2 shits if it is or it is not, I like the company and the stonk and think it is undervalued and will only grow in the future.  That is what the hell I think.  </p>\n\n<p>To be a FinTech disrupter, you obviously need an app and great user-friendly UI and SoFi has a 4.8 rating w over 48K reviews on the $AAPL app store.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR There is no industry/s that need more disruption than banks and brokerages.  For far too long the poors and working class have been hit w hidden fees, outrageous fees, shit even made-up accounts.  SoFi is the just the company to do this disrupting all in one beautiful app!</p>\n\n<p>Shout out to <a href=\"/u/OSRSkarma\">u/OSRSkarma</a> as he kept pushing to post this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9xjby/the_fintech_disrupter_that_everyone_is_talking/","title":"The FinTech Disrupter that everyone is talking about today, none other than Social Finance, Inc aka $SOFI","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"June 29, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-29T18:32:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-29 18:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"321445d0-7f20-54aa-8808-80d44ade3838","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9xjby/the_fintech_disrupter_that_everyone_is_talking/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9xjby/the_fintech_disrupter_that_everyone_is_talking/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"toydan","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/toydan","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"toydan","score":1138,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今話題のフィンテック・ディスラプター、それはSocial Finance, Inc.別名$SOFIです。","the_new_excerpt":"2-3週間前から$SoFiにDDをすると言っていたが、今日の出来高と話題性を考えて\n今日の出来高の増加と言及を見て、私自身の強気のテーゼを打ち出す時が来たと考えた。\nテーゼです。\n\nSoFiは、2011年にMike Cagney、Dan Macklin、James Finnigan、Ian Bradyの4人の学生によって設立されました。\n2011年にSoFiを設立したのは、スタンフォード大学大学院で出会った4人の学生、Mike Cagney、Dan Macklin、James Finnigan、Ian...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"今天大家都在谈论的金融科技颠覆者，不是别人，正是社会金融公司，又称SOFI。","the_new_excerpt":"我已经说了大约2-3周，我将对$SoFi做一个DD，并认为\n随着今天成交量和提及率的增加，现在是时候提出我自己的牛市\n论点。\n\nSoFi于2011年由Mike Cagney、Dan Macklin、James Finnigan和Ian\n布拉迪，四个在斯坦福大学研究生院认识的学生。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天大家都在談論的金融科技顛覆者，不是別人，正是社會金融公司，又稱SOFI。","the_new_excerpt":"我已經說了大約2-3周，我將對$SoFi做一個DD，並認爲\n隨着今天成交量和提及率的增加，現在是時候提出我自己的牛市\n論點。\n\nSoFi於2011年由Mike Cagney、Dan Macklin、James Finnigan和Ian\n布拉迪，四個在斯坦福大學研究生院認識的學生。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-33646042-c6ca-5b92-b7eb-934dbd1956ec","excerpt":"To preface, I work a lot and have a business, and work at ***** who offers a 7%\nmatch on my paychecks and my time working there is abt done.
