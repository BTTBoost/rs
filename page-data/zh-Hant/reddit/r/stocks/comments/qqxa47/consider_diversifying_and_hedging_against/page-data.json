No I am not telling you exactly what company to buy. I am aiming to give you food for thought if you are in disbelief about the current market situation. </p>\n\n<p>I started investing 5 years ago and have beaten the market by CAGR with a good margin ever since (20% vs SP500 14% something). Most of it I attribute to value investing. A school of investing that has consistently outperformed growth investing besides the past half decade. The basic idea is to invest in sound undervalued stocks with a margin of security to minimize risk and maximize upside in all market environments. </p>\n\n<p>I will not go intro details but if you want to read into it go for Benjamin Graham, Buffett, Lynch. A good start could be Modern Value Investing by Sven Carlin, a PhD Prof. in Amsterdam. </p>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s market situation is incredible to say the least. We have rising CPI, money printing, Infrastructure Bills, Defaults in China, Tapering, Fake money velocity being created with the intent of kicking the can down the road in hopes of not hitting it off a cliff soon because it will happen. On top of that a high and rising CAPE (Shiller) of almost 40! </p>\n\n<p>A high CAPE is correlated to low future stock market returns. A Shiller this high signals 0 to NEGATIVE avg SP500 returns. This could also go on for years so that we could see stagnation is the market for 5 - 10 - 15 years even. The point is not if this will happen, we have empirical data on this, but that is only a matter of time until it does. </p>\n\n<p>TSLA is maybe the mascot of this circus alongside Altcoins and the Crypto boom. If you made money until now, great for you. If you are thinking of jumping in now, understand that overpaying for equity is at least as bad as buying bad equity. Again, there is empirical data on the correlation of high valuation and low future equity returns. If you buy most equities right now without thorough anaysis and valuation you will guarantee yourself low returns in the future. </p>\n\n<p>I could go on and on about what dangers lie ahead and why now is the worse time to jump into trendy stocks. But let&#39;s talk now about how to hedge yourself from downturn in the coming years. </p>\n\n<p>Hedging at its core deals with minimizing risk of total loss through different strategies. These strategies start from derivative plays to metals and global diversification. So let me present you some ways to limit your downside down the road. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Currency Hedging ( Gold Miners, Miner ETFs, Fixed rate Debt) \nUse this if you think the USD will lose power. Buffett&#39;s words &quot;gold is going long fear&quot;. Fear is spreding and capital will slowly flow into this asset class. Gold goes up and you are protected. </p></li>\n<li><p>Derivatives (buying SP500 Puts) \nA very simple straight to the point thing to do is buying puts on the US economy via LEAPS. The risk lies in the fact that you need to be right 2 times. Once on the direction of the market and once on the time frame. Longer LEAPS cost a lot so it depends on your liquidity if you can/want/should do this. </p></li>\n<li><p>Diversify globally ( China, Europe, Russia) \nGet your hand on good, undervalued global stocks. Most other regions have lower CAPE than the US. Germany is looking good for this alongside China with the recent BABA drop. </p></li>\n<li><p>Keep some cash \nCash can only be lost to theft and inflation. Keeping 15 - 20% in cash might not be that bad since a market crash would present amazing buying opportunities. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A popular saying is &quot;value investing is dead&quot;. I would argue for the fact that growth investing is dead for the moment. We are at the end of a huge debt cycle. This, just like valuation needs to return to the mean sooner or later. The next period will be favorable for value investing as the house of cards begins to crash down. You will be down a bit if you follow this strategy but you will secure your profits in the long run. This will help your compounding overall. When the crash comes, be prepared to find bargains and go all in. You will thank yourself later.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qqxa47/consider_diversifying_and_hedging_against/","title":"Consider diversifying and hedging against upcoming turmoil.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-10T19:33:20.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-10 19:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qqxa47","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qqxa47/consider_diversifying_and_hedging_against/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qqxa47/consider_diversifying_and_hedging_against/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"JDMKing24","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JDMKing24","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"JDMKing24","score":145,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今後の混乱に備えて、分散投資やヘッジを検討してみてはいかがでしょうか。","the_new_excerpt":"私は暴落を予測しているわけではありません。いや、どの会社にすればいいかを正確に教えているわけではありません。\n買うべきだと言っているわけではありません。現在の市場の状況に不信感を抱いている方に、考えるきっかけを与えることを目的としています。\n考えるきっかけになればと思います。\n\n私は5年前に投資を始めましたが、それ以来、CAGR（年平均成長率）で市場に勝っています。\n20%対SP500...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"考虑多样化，并对即将到来的动荡进行对冲。","the_new_excerpt":"不，我不是在预测崩溃。我不是在告诉你到底该买什么公司\n购买。我的目的是，如果你对目前的市场情况不相信，我可以给你一些思考的余地。\n目前的市场状况。\n\n我在5年前开始投资，以年均复合增长率击败了市场，并且有很好的\n从那时起，我就以年均复合增长率击败了市场（与SP500相比，我有20%的回报率......）。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"考慮多樣化，並對即將到來的動盪進行對沖。","the_new_excerpt":"不，我不是在預測崩潰。我不是在告訴你到底該買什麼公司\n購買。我的目的是，如果你對目前的市場情況不相信，我可以給你一些思考的餘地。\n目前的市場狀況。\n\n我在5年前開始投資，以年均複合增長率擊敗了市場，並且有很好的\n從那時起，我就以年均複合增長率擊敗了市場（與SP500相比，我有20%的回報率......）。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qr0lp8","excerpt":"China Evergrande Group today again defaulted on interest payments to\ninternational investors.
