I haven&#39;t had the need to make a post, until now. What a fucking fantastic day we&#39;ve had in the past couple of days. Now, you&#39;ve probably caught the itch to make it big with all the talks of a short squeeze, seeing as the topic has ignited with a bunch of fresh blood recently with the extreme media coverage of WSJ, Cramer, and various other media outlets. I&#39;ve been in GME for about 5 or 6 months, nowhere near as long <a href=\"/u/UberKikz11\">u/UberKikz11</a>, <a href=\"/u/DeepFuckingValue\">u/DeepFuckingValue</a>, and <a href=\"/u/CptHubbard\">u/CptHubbard</a> of course, but for the past 5 months. All I have been doing is watching this stock, reading the news, visiting stores around the state to get updates from local employees, and so much more.<br/>\nWhat I want every single one of you to realize, is this one of the most artificially suppressed stocks on the market. Short sellers have more shares sold short than there are shares in existence for Gamestop. 71.2 MILLION sold short,<sup>\\</sup>1]) versus an entire outstanding (heh nice) 69.75 Million shares outstanding. Now, let&#39;s do some number crunching. 19.25%, or ~13.4m of those shares<sup>\\</sup>2]), are held by insiders. Our faithful Board of directors, including big dog Ryan Cohen with OVER 9000!!!(9,001,000) shares. leaving us with ~56.35m to play around with. Next stop, Institutional ownership, The big holders. So, of that 56.35m, the top 10 institutional holders hold 43,429,550 <sup>\\</sup>3]) and the top 10 mutual funds hold 18,746,499 <sup>\\</sup>3])  Totalling 62,176,049. So now just between the previously listed holders we have. *drum rolls* 75 Million shares owned by insiders and institutions. WAIT WAIT WAIT HOLD THE PHONE... How is that possible? 75 million shares solely owned by institutions, when there are only 69.75 in existence.  Short sellers. This is where the magnitude of the situation begins. All the shares you are trading right now, all of them that you own, are more than likely a share sold short. So, when the shorts cover their position... well, there just won&#39;t fucking be any without you selling their share sold short back to them, because institutions don&#39;t like to sell until they see BIG returns. Every single shareholder, whether it is your 1, 100, or 10,000 shares that you own right now, is the key.  YOU HOLD THE POWER! I need every single one of you to have faith through the dips and buy more, you are doing your part just by buying one more share on the dip, even more, when you buy 2 or 3 or 100. The key here is to HOLD YOUR FUCKING SHARES UNTIL SHORTS BLEED THEIR LAST DROP, AND ONLY THEN WILL WE SAY, &quot;Wait, you can sell these things?&quot; We are up against some big money here. Big money means they can bleed before covering their positions, but they are a business, they don&#39;t want to have big losses, so the covering WILL happen, and that is when we will see our squeeze. We haven&#39;t even started retards. Keep up the buying pressure with shares.  Your efforts, and patience, will GREATLY be rewarded.</p>\n\n<p>TL,DR: Shorts fukt, bulls win. Buy SHARES, not calls, and HOLD THE LINE until 420.69 (I have full faith in that sell target) GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>\n\n<p><sup>\\</sup>1]) <a href=\"https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2\">https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2</a><br/>\n<sup>\\</sup>2]) <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity\">https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity</a><br/>\n<sup>\\</sup>3]) <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: Rod,A.K.A.
