Even though software engineering is a field where it&#39;s notoriously hard to determine who is actually a skilled engineer, there is the possibility that PLTR has the best and brightest software engineers out of most tech companies.</p>\n\n<p>Unity software isn&#39;t just for video games. But it has potential to be extended to creating all manner of interactive 3D software in general. For example doing VR training simulation for jobs, or VR education (traveling back to ancient Rome in a history class). The bull case would be that Unity eventually becomes the Adobe for 3D interactive content.</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade plans on releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months (based off of the latest interview I&#39;ve watched with the CEO). Their software is designed in such a way that it is easy to do this. A lot of people who&#39;ve done preliminary research on Lemonade, believes that they just do renter&#39;s insurance and are sticking with that. But 3 months ago they&#39;ve released pet insurance. They&#39;re planning on releasing life insurance next month, and then there&#39;s the possibility of car insurance afterwards.  The CEO has also stated that he understands the importance of intersecting humanity&#39;s (art/design) with tech, and that this is a valuable way to capture one of the most scarce commodities, mindshare. Which is why the &quot;Lemonade app&#39;s workflow looks and feels a lot better than going on Geico, Statefarm, Allstate, etc...&quot; (CFO&#39;s words, not mine).</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Yeah a lot of people may be aware of these facts, but I think most investors <em>might</em> not be aware of them. Also I was just trying to give examples.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kkd6um/what_are_some_insights_on_a_company_that_youve/","title":"What are some insights on a company that you've researched that you think most people might not be aware of?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"December 26, 2020","dateISO":"2020-12-26T15:48:44.000Z","datetime":"2020-12-26 15:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"56f30e17-4bd5-5e98-8775-62aaa3c98f19","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kkd6um/what_are_some_insights_on_a_company_that_youve/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kkd6um/what_are_some_insights_on_a_company_that_youve/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Okmanl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Okmanl","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Okmanl","score":88,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"对于一家你研究过的公司，有哪些你认为大多数人可能没有意识到的洞察力？","the_new_excerpt":"示例：\n\n据推测，帕兰提尔的面试过程是所有面试过程中最艰难的\n科技公司，包括谷歌、亚马逊、Facebook、Netflix等。甚至\n虽然软件工程是出了名的很难确定\n他实际上是一名熟练的工程师，这就是…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對於一家你研究過的公司，有哪些你認爲大多數人可能沒有意識到的洞察力？","the_new_excerpt":"示例：\n\n據推測，帕蘭提爾的面試過程是所有面試過程中最艱難的\n科技公司，包括谷歌、亞馬遜、Facebook、Netflix等。甚至\n雖然軟件工程是出了名的很難確定\n他實際上是一名熟練的工程師，這就是…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1336084504642002945","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1336084504642002945","title":"Top performing IPOs from 2010-19 w/ current market cap &gt; $10 billion...\n\n#1: BioNTech (+535% ann.)\n#2: Peloton (+250% ann.)\n#3: Cloudflare (+228% ann.)\n#4: GSX Techedu (+223% ann.)\n#5: Zoom (+218% ann.)\n#6: Moderna (+187% ann.)\n#7: Zscaler (+143% ann.)\n\nhttps://t.co/A8LeUHVNSl https://t.co/3dxsOOHZCW","date":"December 26, 2020","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"zh","full_text":"2010-19年表现最好的IPO，当前市值100亿美元…\n\n#1：BioNTech(+535%an.)\n#2：佩洛顿(+250%ann.)\n#3：CloudFlare(+228%)\n#4：GSX Techedu(+223%an.)\n#5：缩放(+218%安。)\n#6：现代(+187%)\n#7：Zscaler(+143%an.)\n\nhttps://t.co/A8LeUHVNSl https://t.co/3dxsOOHZCW","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"2010-19年表現最好的IPO，當前市值100億美元…\n\n#1：BioNTech(+535%an.)\n#2：佩洛頓(+250%ann.)\n#3：CloudFlare(+228%)\n#4：GSX Techedu(+223%an.)\n#5：縮放(+218%安。)\n#6：現代(+187%)\n#7：Zscaler(+143%an.)\n\nhttps://t.co/A8LeUHVNSl https://t.co/3dxsOOHZCW","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-932ffbe8-d712-5f62-adfe-77c72553a3e6","excerpt":"I was interested in robotic/automated farming ever since I saw the farm.bot\n[https://farm.bot] back in 2017, many other companies like Iron Ox and Sustenir\nare also very similar in which their goal is to reduce waste (soil, land, water)\nand automate farming.\n\n\n\nBut since I only got into investing…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/kkhgg7/where_are_all_the_robotic_agriculture_stocks/","title":"Where are all the robotic agriculture stocks?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"December 26, 2020","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"所有的机器人农业库存都在哪里？","the_new_excerpt":"自从我看到农场后，我就对机器人/自动化农业很感兴趣。\n[https://farm.bot]回到2017年，许多其他公司，如铁牛和苏斯汀\n他们的目标也非常相似，都是减少浪费(土壤、土地、水)\n并实现农业自动化。\n\n\n\n但因为我只投资了…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"所有的機器人農業庫存都在哪裏？","the_new_excerpt":"自從我看到農場後，我就對機器人/自動化農業很感興趣。\n[https://farm.bot]回到2017年，許多其他公司，如鐵牛和蘇斯汀\n他們的目標也非常相似，都是減少浪費(土壤、土地、水)\n並實現農業自動化。\n\n\n\n但因爲我只投資了…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-56f30e17-4bd5-5e98-8775-62aaa3c98f19","previousId":"TweetPost-1336084504642002945","nextId":"RedditPost-932ffbe8-d712-5f62-adfe-77c72553a3e6","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/kkd6um/what_are_some_insights_on_a_company_that_youve/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
