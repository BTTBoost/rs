I also feel that there’s plenty of people who are maybe uncertain about a specific thing surrounding this topic, so I’ve decided to give it a shot and clear a few things about the drama around Alibaba and the other chinese stocks.</p>\n\n<p>So this year as many of you know, the chinese stocks have taken a serious beating this year:</p>\n\n<p>BABA - Down 40% from ATHs</p>\n\n<p>Tencent - Down 40% from ATHs</p>\n\n<p>JD - Down 39% from ATHs</p>\n\n<p>BIDU - Down 50% from ATHs</p>\n\n<p>NIO - Down 30% from ATHs</p>\n\n<p>DIDI - Down 51% from ATHs</p>\n\n<p>And the list goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese stocks have fallen for numerous reasons. There’s regulatory challenges and political risks resulting to fears of delisting, and of course the risks with ADRs. I’ll go through these a little more, and then tell some positives and opportunities \nabout this situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regulatory challenges</strong></p>\n\n<p>All of the chinese companies are under heavy preassure from the CCP. There’s been anti-monopoly regulators <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/china-regulators-fine-alibaba-275-bln-anti-monopoly-violations-2021-04-10/\">fining</a> Alibaba with a fine of $2.8B and fining Tencent also for acquiring companies that would increase its market power. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57938212\">DiDi</a> has seen Chinese regulator interest over how they collect user data. The government is already preparing a fine for the company. Among these cases, there will probably be many future fines to be handed which leaves all the companies under jeopardy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tensions between the US and the Chinese government and the possibility of delisting</strong></p>\n\n<p>The US passed the legislation late last year requiring foreign companies that went public in the US to allow audit inspections in the next three years. The Chinese government on the other hand, wants that Chinese companies would trade at their own exchanges and probably won’t give permission to inspect the companies. This could lead to the delisting of some stocks, and everyone who put money in the companies would be left out with nothing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ADRs</strong></p>\n\n<p>As many of you know, the Chinese companies that are listed in the US exchange aren’t actual shares of the companies. They are <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp\">American depositary receipts</a>. ADR’s job is essentially to mimic price movement of the stock that trades in a place that isn’t accessible for US stock market. While ADRs are good for the people who want to invest somewhere they couldn’t, they come with MASSIVE cons for the investor. </p>\n\n<p>Take Alibaba as an example: The ADR which trades at the NYSE is actually just a holding company in the Cayman Islands. It isn’t the actual Alibaba which trades at the Hong Kong exchange. With this, you don’t hold a right to vote in the Annual meeting of the shareholders and if something bad were to happen, you could maybe even lose all your money. And this is the case for every Chinese stock whether it’s Tencent or NIO.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The opportunity</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Ok, now we’ve gone through the main problems with Chinese stocks. There are some that I didn’t go through, but I think these would be the ones that are the most serious. With everything this going on, this creates an opportunity to snatch these companies on heavy discounts, if you’re willing to take the gamble. </p>\n\n<p>But maybe if you’d give it a little bit of time and see how this pans out and maybe some of the worst risks would go out like the delisting risk, you could take a conservative position. This isn’t financial advice, I don’t hold any Chinese stocks at the moment. I only explained an opportunity. China is showing huge growth with the emerging middle class who are ready to spend. This is big for companies like BABA who are trading at 16x earnings and under book value. </p>\n\n<p>This was just a post to try to clear all the surrounding uncertainty. I gathered everything I have learned from this topic, but please fill some spots I missed. Hopefully I managed to help someone who didn’t know as much as before.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/osmb3j/trying_to_clear_some_things_about_chinese_stocks/","title":"Trying to clear some things about chinese stocks and BABA","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-27T15:52:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-27 15:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0ee4c5af-ef44-5813-a36c-4f501ceb3867","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/osmb3j/trying_to_clear_some_things_about_chinese_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/osmb3j/trying_to_clear_some_things_about_chinese_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"juaggo_","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/juaggo_","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"juaggo_","score":99,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"中国株とBABAについて、いくつかの点をクリアにしようとしています。","the_new_excerpt":"ここ数日、というかこの2ヶ月間は毎日のように\nこの2ヶ月間、毎日のようにBABA株やその他の中国企業に関する投稿が少なくとも3件ありました。\n企業についての投稿がありました。また、この話題について特定の事柄について確信が持てない人がたくさんいると感じたので、私は決めました。\nまた、この話題にまつわる特定の事柄について不安を感じている人も多いと感じたので、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"试图澄清一些关于中国股票和BABA的事情","the_new_excerpt":"在最近几天，实际上是过去两个月的每一天\n至少有三个关于BABA股票和其他中国公司的帖子。\n公司的帖子。我还觉得，有很多人可能不确定\n围绕这个话题的具体事情，所以我决定...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"試圖澄清一些關於中國股票和BABA的事情","the_new_excerpt":"在最近幾天，實際上是過去兩個月的每一天\n至少有三個關於BABA股票和其他中國公司的帖子。\n公司的帖子。我還覺得，有很多人可能不確定\n圍繞這個話題的具體事情，所以我決定...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-cc5add24-617d-5ae3-8a2f-f9ccc1298f12","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osmkxe/the_krusty_krab_commercial_but_its_a_commercial/","title":"The Krusty Krab commercial, but it's a commercial for r/WallStreetBets","date":"July 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Krusty KrabのCMですが、r/WallStreetBetsのCMです。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"蟹堡王的广告，但这是r/WallStreetBets的广告","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"蟹堡王的廣告，但這是r/WallStreetBets的廣告","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6d99b857-4467-56db-8bbd-6b32dc98bff5","excerpt":"Remember that old Chappelle's Show joke about diversifying your bonds?
