I wanted to thank you all who post on this sub. I&#39;ve never posted here, but  I&#39;ve been following for about 6-7 months, and most of my picks came from the detailed posts I came across here. \nI started investing around this time last year as a recent unemployed college graduate (22 years old) putting in some of my Walmart paycheck every other week. Over the spring,I accepted a teaching job and have been able to increase my monthly contributions and have been loving the gains, although small in comparison to what I&#39;ve seen, that I&#39;ve been able to make.\nI know this was an extraordinary year, and I definitely shouldn&#39;t expect these kinds of returns yearly, but I&#39;m eager to see how my portfolio performs in the future!\nSo thanks again everyone for all the thoughtful posts, advice, and DD! And good luck to you all!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/liqzks/first_year_investing_review/","title":"First year investing review","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T04:36:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 04:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"048d34ae-ce11-5c60-8909-18fc6c1b23ed","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/liqzks/first_year_investing_review/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/liqzks/first_year_investing_review/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"noshirtdude","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/noshirtdude","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"noshirtdude","score":270,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"第一年的投资回顾","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n由于现在下班时间已经结束，我可以正式说我已经赚了181.43%的收益了。\n在我第一年投资的时候，赚了7.1k左右。我想感谢各位在\n这个子。我从来没有在这里发过帖子，但我已经关注了6-7个月了。\n我的大部分选择来自于详细的帖子... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"第一年的投資回顧","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n由於現在下班時間已經結束，我可以正式說我已經賺了181.43%的收益了。\n在我第一年投資的時候，賺了7.1k左右。我想感謝各位在\n這個子。我從來沒有在這裏發過帖子，但我已經關注了6-7個月了。\n我的大部分選擇來自於詳細的帖子... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-72efad8f-5115-5dce-a7eb-23df201ffbdf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/libsh8/yesterdays_discussion_gang_weed_loses_a_bit_of/","title":"Yesterday’s Discussion: Gang Weed loses a bit of its high, but remains on top of the table","date":"February 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"昨天的讨论。冈仁波齐失去了一点高涨的势头，但仍然是榜首。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"昨天的討論。岡仁波齊失去了一點高漲的勢頭，但仍然是榜首。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-6ad21a53-61e2-5b28-8ba9-8ad254de9492","excerpt":"I recently read that bull markets can be characterized in a variety of ways, but\nbased on several commonly used merits, the most recent bull market lasted (a\nrecord) 11 years (from '08 until March of last year).
