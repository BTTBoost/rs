The SPY briefly reached record intraday levels. Market participants continue to monitor rising Treasury yields and digested President Biden’s newly proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill, which could include changes to existing tax policy. Today marks the final session of Q1 of 2021. </p>\n\n<p>Ahead of President Biden’s address later today, the White House revealed a new, massive infrastructure proposal. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country&#39;s infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring. View a complete breakdown of the bill <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today marks the final session of an extremely volatile quarter. Year-to-date, cyclical, energy, financial, industrial and reopening stocks have strongly outperformed tech and high-growth stocks that led the market higher last year. As the pace of vaccinations increases (roughly 3 million doses distributed per day in the US), it seems market participants have been rotating to stocks poised to benefit from the gradual reopening of the economy. </p>\n\n<p>Despite signs of economic improvement, market participants are concerned that the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy, combined with massive fiscal spending, may cause an unwanted rise in inflation, reinforced by the recent climb in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (1.735% at the time of writing). Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html\"> to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs</a> in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A U.S. judge on Wednesday dismissed litigation accusing 10 large banks of conspiring to suppress competition in the multi-trillion dollar market for U.S. Treasury securities.
