Kaplan’s early retirement follows an announcement earlier in the day from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said he will leave as well but cited health concerns and not the issue over his investment portfolio activity. “The Federal Reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy. Unfortunately, the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction to the Federal Reserve’s execution of that vital work,” Kaplan said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>His retirement takes effect Oct. 8. The resignations come a day before Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to spend two days on Capitol Hill updating legislators on the Fed’s efforts to combat the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Controversy had swirled over the issue following disclosures that Kaplan in particular had been executing large-dollar trades in big-name companies such as Amazon, Apple and Delta Airlines. The Wall Street Journal first reported the trades. Subsequent to the disclosures, both Kaplan and Rosengren said they would be selling their stocks to avoid the appearance of conflict. Questions were raised because the Fed has conducted trillions of dollars in asset purchases aimed at helping markets function, and has bought corporate bonds from mega-cap companies including Apple.</p>\n\n<p>Kaplan insisted he had done nothing wrong. “During my tenure, I have adhered to all Federal Reserve ethical standards and policies,” he said in his monthly statement. “My securities investing activities and disclosures met Bank compliance rules and standards.” Still, the issue has reverberated through the Fed, with officials pledging to tighten rules so that such potential conflicts don’t happen again. “We need to make changes, and we’re going to do that as a consequence of this,” Powell said last week. “This will be a thorough going and comprehensive review. We’re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.” Powell vowed that changes would be made. “I want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public’s interest and the institution that we’re all a part of,” he said. Powell on Monday wished Kaplan well and praised his work at the Dallas Fed. “He has been a passionate and forceful public voice on a wide range of issues, including the critical value of early childhood education and literacy,” the chairman said in a statement. Meredith Black, the first vice president at the Dallas Fed who herself was planning on retiring, will serve as interim head for the district until a permanent successor is chosen.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/pwqgq9/dallas_fed_president_kaplan_to_retire_early_on/","title":"Dallas Fed President Kaplan to retire early on Oct. 8, citing trading disclosure ‘distraction’","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-27T22:22:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-27 22:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pwqgq9","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pwqgq9/dallas_fed_president_kaplan_to_retire_early_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/pwqgq9/dallas_fed_president_kaplan_to_retire_early_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"WickedSensitiveCrew","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WickedSensitiveCrew","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"WickedSensitiveCrew","score":861,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"カプラン・ダラス連銀総裁、10月8日付で早期退職へ、取引情報開示の「気晴らし」を理由に","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html\n\nダラス連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）のロバート・カプラン総裁は、2人目の地方中央銀行総裁として辞任した。\n辞任した2人目の中央銀行総裁となった。\n最近の...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"达拉斯联储主席卡普兰将于10月8日提前退休，理由是交易披露 \"分心","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html\n\n达拉斯联储主席罗伯特-卡普兰周一成为第二位辞职的地区央行领导人。\n周一，达拉斯联储主席罗伯特-卡普兰（Robert Kaplan）成为第二位辞职的地区性央行领导人，他说自己在最近的事件后提前卸任。\n在最近的一次会议上，他说他将提前卸任...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"達拉斯聯儲主席卡普蘭將於10月8日提前退休，理由是交易披露 \"分心","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html\n\n達拉斯聯儲主席羅伯特-卡普蘭週一成爲第二位辭職的地區央行領導人。\n週一，達拉斯聯儲主席羅伯特-卡普蘭（Robert Kaplan）成爲第二位辭職的地區性央行領導人，他說自己在最近的事件後提前卸任。\n在最近的一次會議上，他說他將提前卸任...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pwnujk","excerpt":"I’m a partner in a small venture capital firm, with a focus in the aviation and\naerospace industries.
