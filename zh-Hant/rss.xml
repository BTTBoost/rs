&lt;p&gt;Like why wouldn&amp;#39;t you just buy or hold something? What advantage do options or futures give you over just traditional investing? I get things like margin or leverage as in riskily buying more than you can afford but I just don&amp;#39;t get what the point or how options or futures work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, options sounds like ok I&amp;#39;ll buy the right to buy a stock at this price, if it goes down I just won&amp;#39;t fulfill the obligation because I don&amp;#39;t have to and if it goes up then sure I&amp;#39;ll fulfill the contract. Again, that&amp;#39;s definitely not right because that would just be an infinite money glitch because you would always never take the option if it&amp;#39;s going down and always take it if it goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futures makes a little more sense because you have to oblige the contract. But then why wouldn&amp;#39;t you just buy something normally? What&amp;#39;s the benefit of buying at a set time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR, genuinely have no idea how options/futures work and what their point is, and I probably sound really dumb but if someone can explain in a way that makes sense I would really appreciate that, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

That’s 32% more than General Motors (GM) is worth, and 47% more than Ford (F). Rivian has never sold a vehicle until this year. GM sells around 7 million vehicles per year; Ford, 4 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you add up the market value of Tesla (TSLA), Rivian, and 5 other startups including Lucid (LCID), Nikola (NKLA), Fisker (FSR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE) and Workhorse (WKHS), their combined capitalization is nearly $1.3 trillion. Nine of the world’s biggest automakers—GM, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler-Benz—are only worth $845 billion. So those 9 giant automakers are worth 34% less than 7 fledgling EV manufacturers. As for sales, the established manufacturers outsell the EV upstarts 100 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market now seems to view &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-ceo-sees-annual-production-144553789.html&quot;&gt;Rivian&lt;/a&gt; as a Tesla-in-the-making, especially since it already has backing from Amazon and Ford. By focusing on sport pickups and delivery vans, Rivian has one foot in consumer vehicles and the other in commercial applications, a shrewd mix that lets the company spread its bets on a trend that is already a revolution in ground transportation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth.&lt;/strong&gt; In market terms, investors consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-is-not-enough-engine-no-1-bets-on-gm-white-paper-details-electric-vehicle-landscape-124811083.html&quot;&gt;EV newcomers&lt;/a&gt; such as Tesla and Rivian to be growth and technology companies with tons of upside potential. Traditional automakers are industrial concerns capable of incremental growth, at best. While virtually every big automaker is developing EV technology, the old ones won’t attain nearly the same rapid growth as the new ones will. That’s because they have massive investments in internal-combustion engines, or ICE—a.k.a. gas-and diesel-powered cars—that will decline as the new EV technology ramps up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM, for instance, sold 202,000 EVs in 2020, which was third most of any automaker, behind Tesla and Volkswagen. But for GM the technology of the future represented just 3% of all sales. The other 97% were legacy ICE vehicles likely to decline as a share of the overall market for years to come. At Tesla, 100% of sales were EVs, with no legacy business to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new technology is where the growth is. Tesla’s revenue growth rate during the last two years has been 39%, according to S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ. GM’s has been a negative 5%. Pandemic disruptions have been a factor in both company’s performance, but the trend was the same before the pandemic. GM still makes a lot of money selling high-margin pickups and SUVs, but investors view that as a business that could someday dwindle to no profit at all. Electrics, by contrast, will only get more profitable as costs drop, technology advances and more people buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional carmakers such as GM and Ford argue that the profitability of existing lineups gives them an advantage because they have in-house funding for new EV technology. But startups haven’t needed in-house funding because capital markets have been a ready source of money. “Capital for EV [manufacturers] is widely available and cheap in current market conditions, so we believe momentum/support for many of the stocks will persist,” analyst John Murphy of Bank of America wrote in a recent research note. “As has proven the case for Tesla over the past decade, the higher the upward spiral of stock, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nvidia Stock Gets a 49% Price Target Boost Before Earnings. Why Analysts Are Bullish.&lt;br/&gt;
 Analysts led by Rick Schafer at Oppenheimer reiterated their Outperform rating on Nvidia stock and raised their target price on the shares by 49% to $350 from $235.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meanwhile, Christopher Rolland at Susquehanna reiterated his Positive rating on Nvidia stock and hiked his target price to $360 from $250. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just me or do these guys just raise their prise targets as the stock soars so their performance on websites like tipranks doesn&amp;#39;t suffer? Nothing about nvidia&amp;#39;s performance has changed this quarter that would suddenly warrant an increase of nvidia&amp;#39;s market cap by 300 billion dollars. I think price targets are an important tool, especially for retail investors, but lately these guys seem to just make it up as they go. At $350b nvidia is a 900b company on 10b of forward net earnings. That&amp;#39;s just bonkers and these guys seem to base their price targets on how far they think the current bull market can inflate the ever increasing sentiment instead of what the stock is fundamentally worth.&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#39;ve been attaching unique IDs to items for thousands of years. I think people will soon figure out that not everything needs to be on the blockchain and that NFT marketplaces would be better suited on a centralized server, not Ethereum.   When you own an NFT, you don&amp;#39;t own the legal rights to the JPEG, nor do you even own a JPEG. You are really just buying a shitcoin that has a link to a JPEG URL. In ten years time all their NFTs will be deleted 404 pages and all you will have is a worthless shitcoin. There&amp;#39;s also a lot of problems with NFTs regarding intellectual property theft, as people can auction off property they have no legal right to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is merit to a marketplace of property though. There isn&amp;#39;t a regulated exchange for collectables in America. We have the NYSE for stocks, CME for commodities, but we don&amp;#39;t have one to trade collectable/non fungible items. Because such a thing doesn&amp;#39;t exist, blockchain based marketplaces are filling the void for that niche in the meantime. I think the preferred medium is a regulated exchange where real people are KYC&amp;#39;d and vetted before pushing an auction to sale. The obvious advantage of it is that governments will recognize property rights of the sales. You can still settle all of the transactions digitally, but it will take place on centralized servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market finished mixed on Thursday, as market participants continue to grapple with the implication of the latest inflation report and third-quarter earnings, which are showing signs of slowing down as it winds down. The S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) rose after two consecutive down days, as tech stocks made a comeback, closing 0.04% and 0.28% higher, led by a rebound in technology stocks, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.44% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.8% higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a slow news days due to it being Veteran’s Day holiday in the US, market participants continue to digest the Consumer Price Index released tomorrow, which showed prices of consumer good surging 6.2%.  in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew Luzzetti, Chief US Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “This [the CPI report] is certainly telling us, I think, that price pressures are more persistent. They are broader. They are not just narrowly focused on those categories, whether it&amp;#39;s autos and the supply-constrained items. And it&amp;#39;s going to last longer than expected. We do think that the Fed is going to have to raise rates next year. They&amp;#39;ve signaled that they&amp;#39;re going to taper through the middle of the year, and that&amp;#39;s our baseline at this point. But if you continue to see price pressures like this over the coming months and more persistent, it may cause them to have to act earlier than expected.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disney (DIS) stock slipped to an 11-month low following disappointing earnings. For the first time ever, Netflix (NFLX) has overtaken Disney’s market cap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After its blockbuster debut to the market yesterday, shares of EV maker Rivian (RIVN) remained on fire, pushing the company well past a $100b market cap in only two days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla (TSLA) is carrying thru with his promise to sell Tesla stock and sold about $5 billion worth of stock today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toyota says large parts of the world are not ready for EVs and committed $240 million to building a hybrid car parts plant in West Virginia. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Mills Inc is considering the sale of its soup brand Progresso and ready-to-eat meals label Helper for $3 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings expects Beijing to allow &amp;#39;metaverse&amp;#39; virtual environment services, now the talk of Silicon Valley, to operate in China - provided they fall in line with Chinese rules. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a lot of technologies that&amp;#39;s related to the development of games as well as for the metaverse,&amp;quot; Tencent president Martin Lau told analysts on a call peppered with questions about the metaverse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google lost an appeal against a 2.42-billion-euro ($2.8-billion) European antitrust decision on Wednesday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unity Software (U) buy special effects company Weta Digital for $1.3 billion. The studio, founded by Peter Jackson, was responsible for special effects in Avatar and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people talk about low growth periods like post tech bubble 2000’s, or stagflation during the 70’s. This is often talked about as a period where “the market remains flat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But during those periods, aren’t companies (and index funds) still paying dividends? Seems to me that you’ll have growth on the way back up as an existing asset holder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence why it’s important to stay the course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the question makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the dip justify? Most will agree: heck no&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s just how the current market is operating. Miss earnings and you’ll get killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe these companies that are losing half their valuation from missed earnings are severely undervalued and will rebound in due time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe $PSFE will rebound much easier than most other beaten down stock because it was previously a spac traded publicly at $10. Institutional buyers got in at this price and now we’re 60% down from there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s trading at a low $4 penny stock range which could be appealing to retail investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am starting to load up massively. Possibly make a in-depth DD post if its worth while. &lt;/p&gt;

The plan then would be something like this, but I worry the Smallcap allocation is a bit too high looking at target date funds for reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;70% FID 500 Index (FXAIX)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;20% FID MID CAP IDX (FSMDX)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;10% FID SM CAP IDX (FSSNX)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I’m just doing a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRowePrice Target Date Fund&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (TRPLX — it’s the only TDF available to me in the 401K), but the Expense Ratio on that is nearly half a percent (0.46) so I’m weighing just switching it over to the Fidelity SP500 + Fidelity Mid / Fidelity Small cap (significantly lower expense ratios).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly there aren’t any good options for International or Bond Funds in my 401K (options are all actively managed with laughable expense ratios) so I’d have to get those in my Taxable/Roth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve done is look at Target Date Funds and it looks like Schwab for example allocates about 20% to mid cap and about 6% to Small cap. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

They provide a range of lending and wealth management services. At the time of this post, they are trading at about $23.65. They released earnings for Q3 on November 10. They reported Revenue of $272.01 million for the 3rd quarter of 2021 which is a 35.5% increase from the same prior-year period. SoFi beat estimates by $16.38M. Furthermore, they added 377,000 new members which is the second-highest quarterly increase in the company&amp;#39;s history. That being said, SoFi looks to be a potential buy. Not convinced yet? Here are some other reasons why I believe SoFi is a good company to buy into. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SoFi’s total members grew 96% Year-over-Year. Part of the reason why this occurred is because the products they offer have doubled Year-over-Year. The company beat Revenue Expectations, Earnings Per Share, almost doubled their member growth Year-over-Year and began offering way more products. Most people can find a product that suits them through SoFi’s financial services. In Quarter 3, they did a great job at  demonstrating their ability to capture market share. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SoFi has increased the amount of marketing they’ve been doing. They’ve been working with influencers across Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and Tik Tok. Which has driven an additional 400 Million impressions and 775K engagements with SoFi content. SoFi has been investing a lot in their marketing strategy and attempts to acquire customers which has obviously translated into very great results. By the looks of it, SoFi has started to get creative in adopting additional customers. These new strategies could help boost the company by a lot. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In relation to their valuation, SoFi experienced strong growth which was driven by the growth of users they had experienced and the products they offer, especially in the personal loans sector. Right now, the company looks like it’s trading at a decent price in comparison with other companies in this sector. If the company can somehow increase their Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization over the years coming, they could see it’s multiples inflate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far into this post you’re probably asking yourself, Are there any risks involved with investing in this company? Like any investment, there is always a risk. Despite the fact that SoFi reported a strong quarter, they need to show that they can keep up their strength. The stock continuing to go up will be contingent on continued success and an increase in profitability over the future quarters. That being said, I wouldn’t say this is a strong buy, but a potential one. It could be a great buy if it dips again. However, This company is currently trading at reasonable multiples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading everyone! If you have any questions let me know in the comments below or feel free to message me! I hope this helped you figure out whether or not to buy into SoFi. Also, feel free to check out my profile and see the analysis I did on Digital Turbine AKA $APPS. You will definitely learn something from it!&lt;/p&gt;

Many retail traders don&amp;#39;t know what it means or how to respond. More specifically, many are having trouble with tailoring their portfolios to either avoid risk or take advantage of inflationary circumstances. I aim to somewhat remedy this. I hope the pointers below will help you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. This is not the end all or be all and I welcome your observations and comments on what I could have missed. Enjoy this and lets make some money taking advantage of these once in a lifetime economic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflations is Measured by a Change in Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; Inflation doesn&amp;#39;t usually go down. The RATE of inflation goes up or down, but inflation itself is persistent. This is by design. Could you imagine what would happen to the economy if you knew that your dollar would be worth more tomorrow than it is today? Spending on goods other than necessities would come to a very dramatic reduction (&lt;em&gt;Note: You might be rethinking crypto right now huh?&lt;/em&gt;). So it is important to understand that what we are looking at is the CHANGE IN RATE of inflation. There is no deflation!! Deflation is 1000x worse for the economy than inflation. So do not expect deflation. The Fed simply will not allow it. Nor should they!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Inflation is Largely a Result of too Much Demand:&lt;/strong&gt; During the COVID lock downs many businesses were forced to grind their operations to a halt. Remember food, toilet paper, &amp;amp; other essentials flying off the shelves? Indeed many grocery stores were limiting the amount of water you could buy. It only stands to reason that when you force businesses to close down you create a situation where the goods that people demand are not being replaced by a steady supply. So what happens as the economy opens back up? Suddenly those same businesses have reduced inventories, they need to hire back workers, they need to order new supplies, &amp;amp; they need to meet an increased demand as a result of some competitors closing their doors for good. Now the quantity of goods demanded well exceeds the quantity of goods supplied ... on all fronts. Reopening firms are competing against other reopening firms for the same raw materials, supplies, resources, shipping, etc. They are also competing for the same labor pool. Remember that goods &amp;amp; services in times of extreme scarcity go to the highest bidder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary &amp;amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand (Or too Little Supply):&lt;/strong&gt; Below you will find the inflationary issues we find ourselves in as a result of increased demand and limited supply. Below each topic you will also find some examples of how to profit from each. You will also receive some examples of secondary and tertiary effects of each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain Bottlenecks:&lt;/strong&gt; First and foremost in the news are the supply chain bottlenecks. We&amp;#39;ve all seen the ships floating off the Port of Los Angeles, or the very long line of trucks waiting to pick up freight from the ports. The United States &amp;amp; Europe have but a limited number of ports and they&amp;#39;re taking on all the supplies that firms ordered as the economy opened back up. Making things worse ... its holiday shopping season. So cost of shipping dry bulk overseas is not just rising as a result of increased demand, but as a result of the fact that it costs money to have all these carriers waiting weeks to offload their goods. Making matters worse many of the imported goods are perishables which can spoil and reduce the supply of foodstuffs amid an already high demand. As a result many firms are opting for alternative methods of shipping like the much more expensive option of air freight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Moderately bullish on sea freight carriers, rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain Shortages:&lt;/strong&gt; As if the bottlenecks weren&amp;#39;t bad enough, there are but a limited number of domestic shipping firms. Firms that not only transport materials to businesses, or, finished goods to retailers, but also delivering orders to retail shoppers. Here we are once again talking about rail, trucking, mail delivery, air freight, logistics firms, logistics outsourcing, etc. So yet again we have an increased demand for shipping and logistics with but a limited supply. And while this demand will keep up for some time, many firms know it will eventually come back down to normal, and therefore, are very hesitant to expand too fast too quickly for fear that they will one day have too much fleet for future business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Moderately bullish on rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semiconductor Shortages:&lt;/strong&gt; Everything these days has a semiconductor. Whether its semiconductors, passive semiconductors, diodes, you name it, chances are if it was an electronic made in the last 5 years, it needs a semiconductor to properly operate. Indeed before the supply chain shortages hit critical mass, we were dealing with semiconductor shortages. Now we will not likely fix the semiconductor issue until we fix the supply chain issue. Once again as the economy opened back up &amp;amp; demand skyrocketed, semiconductors too experienced a complementary spike in demand. Semiconductors alone are preventing the automakers from producing at full capacity. There are not enough semiconductors to make vehicles. And with the holidays on the horizon semiconductors are in higher demand than ever. Even Sony had to reduce the number of PlayStations they could manufacture and ship due to component shortages and logistics issues. So expect the price of any new electronic device that has a semiconductor to increase in price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Bullish on electronics &amp;amp; semiconductors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicle Shortages:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted with the semiconductors, vehicles are in short supply. As a result the quantity of vehicles demanded exceed the quantity of vehicles supplied. Therefore we not only have a shortage of vehicles but the price o vehicles have skyrocketed. Have you seen the empty lots at your local dealership? There&amp;#39;s nothing to sell! People are ordering direct from factory. As a result people turned toward used vehicles which now are also in short supply. As a result people who could not afford the increased price of used vehicles resulted to maintaining their current vehicles. And as a result of people maintaining their current vehicles, the demand for auto parts &amp;amp; auto mechanics have skyrocketed. And I don&amp;#39;t know many large firms that do not need a frequent supply of vehicles to maintain operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderately bullish to bullish on used car firms, auto parts, and car repair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**)**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw Material Shortages:&lt;/strong&gt; Raw materials were the first to explode out of COVID. Wood, steel, ore, oil, &amp;amp; minerals ... you name it, its all going up. The quantity of supply demanded exceed the current supply ... and for many reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderately bullish on miners, steel, mining equipment suppliers, and oil/gas producers ... see energy shortage below for more detail on oil/gas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**)**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Demand for Housing:&lt;/strong&gt; Largely as a result of low interest rates incentivizing lending, we experienced a housing and construction boom in the middle of a Pandemic. Houses and industrial builds in many areas have skyrocketed in value. But this was not only as a result of low interest rates. When the federal government instituted a ban on evictions from rental properties, many took advantage by simply not paying their rent. The forgone payments to the landlord forced the renter to pass on the costs on to new tenants, which increased the cost of rental properties beyond that just owning a home in many areas. So people bought homes instead. Moreover many people moved out of urban areas to escape burdensome COVID restrictions which furthermore increased the demand of housing. Furthermore lifetime renting millennials saw the low interest rates as a great time to buy their first home. Finally, mortgage forbearance reduced a lot of foreclosures during COVID. Less foreclosures means less supply, less supply amid high demand results in higher prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not very bullish on housing &amp;amp; real estate at this time but still moderately bullish on construction, furniture, paint, fixtures, and infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**).**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Shortages:&lt;/strong&gt; As we began to put the COVID economy behind us, more people are travelling to work, to school, and going on vacation. More recently international travel is opening back up.  Moreover firms are expanding rapidly to meet demand and shippers are using more energy than ever. This all of course increases the price of oil, natural gas, jet fuel, and the fuel you pay at the pump. Making matters worse, no matter what your politics are, the current administration in the White House is the most ardently unfriendly domestic coal and fossil fuel administrations we&amp;#39;ve had in 5 years. OPEC, perhaps realizing that such demand will be but temporary for the next 1-2 years, refuses to entertain the Biden administrations request to ramp up oil supply. Oddly enough big oil hasn&amp;#39;t been in this good of a position for the last 4 years where the increase of supply made it seriously hard for oil firms to profit. Energy is used for producing everything. When energy goes up the cost of everything goes up. When energy goes up, people spend more on energy and less on other things. So the increase in energy costs are a result of both increased post COVID demand and politics. Of all the issues we are experiencing with inflated prices, energy is among the easiest to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ullish on oil, natural gas, oil and natural gas equipment maintainers and suppliers, and perhaps oil exploration if the Biden administration would quit putting up road blocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**)**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worker Shortages:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Worker Shortages&amp;quot; is misleading. When people think of a &amp;quot;worker shortage&amp;quot; they generally think that we don&amp;#39;t have enough workers to meet demand. They would be correct. But we should phrase it as &amp;quot;firms do not have enough workers to meet CURRENT demand.&amp;quot; Lets face it we are rear view looking creatures. Simply because a firm doesn&amp;#39;t have enough workers does not indicate that they cant beat previous profit/revenue, but rather they can not only beat previous revenue projections, but also be in a position where they cannot meet CURRENT demand. And just like anything else, when the quantity of labor demanded exceeds the quantity of labor supplied, we run into increased labor costs ... namely wages. And wages are overwhelmingly the highest cost for most firms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bullish on staffing and outsourcing firms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;**)**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary &amp;amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand ... Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; Lets keep this simple. You want to buy a car. That car is made from raw materials such as aluminum &amp;amp; steel. The car requires electronics. Those electronics require semiconductors. You need a labor force to put that car together. You need energy to manufacture that car. You need truckers &amp;amp; freighters to ship those cars or bring manufacturers the materials to make cars. You need equipment to make cars. In short 100% of the price of all components of that car, or the components used to make that car, have gone up. Still, you have a high demand market where people and businesses require vehicles, but the manufacturer cant meet that demand due to the lack of supplies available. Nevertheless the vehicle manufacturer still needs to pay for overhead costs to keep the doors open. And as so many people are demanding such a short supply of cars, the manufacturers simply increase the price of that car to meet the demand of the highest paying bidders. And this phenomenon is happening in each step of the chain to make that car from the folks who supply the materials, to the folks who produce the energy, to the folks who ship the finished product. When the quantity of goods demanded exceed the quantity of goods supplied, prices necessarily must go up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monetary Drivers of Inflation:&lt;/strong&gt;  As a result of the dramatic initial downward shift in demand amid COVID lockdowns, the Federal Reserve made money cheap, essentially lowering interests rates to both incentivize borrowing and make borrowing more affordable. The result? Massive influxes of borrowing and lending which in turn flooded the economy with cash. At first this excess cash was used to make it through the pandemic. Later this cash was used by firms to expand rapidly to meet demand. People also used cheap money via extremely low interest rates to purchase homes, which increased the demand for housing. Eventually the Fed is going to need to raise interest rates to disincentive lending and cool off a hot economy. If allowed to persist for too long the influx of cash will lead to investments by firms looking to to stave off losing the value of money via inflation and thereby creating a massive bubble. There are already indicators of this happening by virtue of equity valuations in the market. (&lt;em&gt;Note: the Fed has also been incentivizing investment in the stock market by buying treasury bonds on the secondary market which resulted in keeping the yields artificially low. As a result people were less inclined to buy treasury bonds and more incentivized to invest in other equity&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government Drivers of Inflation:&lt;/strong&gt; The rapid inflation we are experiencing has not deterred President Biden for advocating for trillions in spending measures. The U.S. Government is a customer just like anyone else, and the government competes for the same goods and services you and I do. Increased spending will to some extent result in crowding out the private sector that competes for the same goods and services. Remember that an increase in demand with limited supply generally results increased prices. If the government spends too much, it can seriously hurt consumers in the form of increased prices. Moreover the Biden administration isn&amp;#39;t the most friendly administration when it comes to mining for coal, oil, minerals, etc.. This inevitably leads to increased costs of energy and raw materials. (&lt;em&gt;Note: This comment used a political figure as an example of a negative economic consequence. Do me a favor, take the example for what its worth to you, and realize I am not going to entertain heated political discussion. There is a cost and benefit to everything, and I don&amp;#39;t have the time to entertain the talking points you pulled from a political webpage or favorable news site and tell you why you&amp;#39;re wrong, when no matter how much the evidence is stacked against you, you&amp;#39;re not going to change your mind anyway. Ergo a massive waste of time that benefits no one&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflation is Excellent for Debt!:&lt;/strong&gt; I will keep this one quick. Lets say you took out a 30 year fixed mortgage in 1990. You paid $90,000 for your home and have a mortgage of $400 per month. In the year 2019 your home is now worth $200,000 in market value but you&amp;#39;re still paying $400 per month at a fixed rate. Through inflation your wages have eventually increased while your fixed rate mortgage remained stagnant. In short, you may have been scrimping for pennies when you took out the mortgage, but years later you can make your payment while working at a fast food restaurant. Neat huh? Inflation is excellent for debt ridden companies. As their profit margins increase over time through inflation they will find it much easier to pay off their long term debt. (&lt;em&gt;Note: Perhaps this put some of the companies you were looking at into better perspective, and if debt was a major factor for not investing, then you may or may not want to revisit your decision.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullish Sectors You Can Profit From that I did not Mention Above:&lt;/strong&gt; Industrial Chemicals, Industrial Equipment, Fertilizers, Farm Equipment/Construction, and Pesticides. As firms ramp up production they will increase the demand for industrial chemicals. Moreover, as food prices continue to increase the more land farmers will be incentivized to clear for additional farming which requires more farming construction, farming equipment, chemicals/pesticides, and fertilizers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Canary in the Inflation Coal Mine:&lt;/strong&gt; If the change in prices rise beyond the change in incomes to the point where people need to start economizing their necessities and forgoing their wants, we could be looking at a very serious correction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope the pointers above have helped you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. Please understand that I will be reading this over and over again to identify typos &amp;amp; unclear sentences. I may even edit it as people bring ideas to my attention. Anyway I hope you enjoyed it and can turn this into long term investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

Their timing (mostly by sheer luck) could not have been more perfect. More importantly, they specifically have amassed a huge inventory of what were previously 10-20k cars to appeal to the lower/middle income demographic. This range has appreciated more than any range of used vehicle. We’re talking 50-60% from a couple years ago in many cases. Best part is, used car prices continue to skyrocket as supply shortages and inflation show no signs of retreat. At some point the carousel will stop but until then I think Shift will experience rapid growth and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I have heard more and more people talk about buying from Shift, and it’s relative ease compared to Carvana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shift is rapidly stealing market share from Carvana, yet is valued at only 600mil to Carvana’s 49Bil valuation. For whatever it’s worth, last I checked it’s short interest was about 22%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shift reports earnings today after market close. I think it’s a nice opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parent is retired and receiving deceased spouses pension. Post-retirement financials are something I am not familiar with, but my understanding is she should transition to a large percentage of bonds at this point to significantly lessen her risk tolerance (60/40 or 50/50?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a little overwhelmed of what to recommend. I think she should speak to a fiduciary possibly?&lt;/p&gt;

For those of you who don’t already know, or who were not affected by it, I woke up this morning (on my first day of a 4 day weekend). Checked my portfolio after seeing my biggest position was up 5.2%. A great feeling! I logged in and saw all my options moved from out of to in the money, and I was up a couple hundred on my shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinhood did not update my portfolio balance and I figured it was bad WiFi. I switched to LTE. Same thing. Then I was hit with an unexpected error message, so I restarted the app. Then, I get told I could not log in. With the recent hacks, I became nervous. I did a web search and found that “several users were experiencing problems with login preventing them from logging into their account”. One hour later, I log back in to see that the moment I was checking my account I was up $2,000 and was now up $500. I love the Robinhood interface and commission free trades but damn. That was the last straw&lt;/p&gt;

I do want to get into it for the long term, and am considering the VanEck Semiconductors ETF but am curious if I should wait. Naturally, since I&amp;#39;m in it for a long term it doesn&amp;#39;t matter that much if there is a correction, however a correction does mean I could get more shares in it.

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I decided to start our bogleheads journey 3 months ago. We are both working fulltime and are still figuring out how much we can allocate to our Vanguard index fond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do monthly contributions to our savings account (emergency fund, vacation money etc. ) and to our index fond. My question is do you guys reach a certain point after you eliminate the monthly contributions to your savings account? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still discussing about this because if we stop contributing to our savings account we could of course invest way more into vanguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently we contribute 2k into Vanguard and 2k into savings account each month - we have around 30k in Vanguard and 100k in savings account. Together we make about 180k per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company fires its CEO without a named successor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core marketplace revenue down 55%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q4 revenue expected to be even worse than Q3 despite the holidays… unheard of.  The company had already completely shut off marketing in Q3, so this means customers are ditching Wish left and right&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Free Cash Flow was -$344M this quarter.  The company is burning roughly $300M/quarter this year (despite shutting off sales and marketing) and has $1.1B left… At this rate, the company will be insolvent by next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying short the stock, but if you think the stock has “bottomed”, I think there’s a good chance the bottom is at $0/share and it’ll get there as soon as next summer.&lt;/p&gt;
