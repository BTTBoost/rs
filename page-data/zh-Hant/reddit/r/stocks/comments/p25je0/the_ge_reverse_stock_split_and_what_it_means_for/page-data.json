Also sorry for the length, spelling, Grammer, and ramblings. </p>\n\n<p>With that being said as the title suggests I am very curious on what I should do here. I own stock in GE. </p>\n\n<p>GE was just the 5th company ever on the S&amp;P 500 to do a reverse stock split. (1for8). </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s usually bad when a company does that.</p>\n\n<p>I bought back a few years ago and since then I am now down 51% overall. So do I dump the stock and try to save my ass. Do I hold based on the fact I can just hold it for the next 30-40 years and ride it out (in my IRA). OR DO I DOUBLE DOWN since GE seems to really be turning itself around.</p>\n\n<p>I had a lot of confidence when I first bought GE that they were turning around, but maybe this is it? Buffet dumped GE in 2017 and said they needed to focus up. I do like that they said they are going to focus efforts on just 4 major sectors and all future oriented IMO.</p>\n\n<p>healthcare, aviation, power, and renewable energy. </p>\n\n<p>Aviation is where they are big but healthcare too.. but I feel like power and renewable can be big for them over the long run and if done right.</p>\n\n<p>Year over year they have been paying their debt off and focused on those 4 areas. They also just had a good second quarter in June and seem to really be improving. </p>\n\n<p>Edit to include articles. </p>\n\n<p>Company info - <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE/balance-sheet?p=GE\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE/balance-sheet?p=GE</a></p>\n\n<p>Bullish - <a href=\"https://investorplace.com/2021/08/buy-ge-stock-as-the-companys-fortunes-finally-turn/\">https://investorplace.com/2021/08/buy-ge-stock-as-the-companys-fortunes-finally-turn/</a></p>\n\n<p>Hold - <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reverse-stock-split-ge-trading-145334436.html\">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reverse-stock-split-ge-trading-145334436.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Bearish- <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ges-stock-slips-after-deutsche-bank-analyst-effectively-cuts-price-target-2021-08-09\">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ges-stock-slips-after-deutsche-bank-analyst-effectively-cuts-price-target-2021-08-09</a></p>\n\n<p>TL;DR Should I sell GE due to their reverse stock split, double down due to their improvements, or just hold out.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p25je0/the_ge_reverse_stock_split_and_what_it_means_for/","title":"The GE reverse stock split and what it means for the future of the company.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-11T13:30:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-11 13:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"340465fb-52fb-59d4-92be-818ac0429665","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p25je0/the_ge_reverse_stock_split_and_what_it_means_for/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p25je0/the_ge_reverse_stock_split_and_what_it_means_for/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"DashCloude","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DashCloude","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DashCloude","score":54,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"GEの株式併合と、それが会社の将来にとって何を意味するか。","the_new_excerpt":"初めての投稿なので、ルールに違反しないようにします。また\nまた、長文、誤字脱字、文法、乱文、申し訳ありません。\n\nタイトルにもあるように、私はここで何をすべきか非常に興味があります。\nここで、私は 私はGEの株を持っています。\n\nGEはS&P500の中で5番目に逆ザヤを解消した企業です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"通用电气的反向股票分割以及它对公司的未来意味着什么。","the_new_excerpt":"我是第一次在股票上发帖，所以我尽量不违反任何规则。也很抱歉\n对于文章的长度、拼写、语法和胡言乱语。\n\n正如标题所示，我非常好奇我应该做什么。\n这里。我拥有通用电气的股票。\n\n通用电气是标准普尔500指数中有史以来第五家做反向投资的公司。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"通用電氣的反向股票分割以及它對公司的未來意味着什麼。","the_new_excerpt":"我是第一次在股票上發帖，所以我儘量不違反任何規則。也很抱歉\n對於文章的長度、拼寫、語法和胡言亂語。\n\n正如標題所示，我非常好奇我應該做什麼。\n這裏。我擁有通用電氣的股票。\n\n通用電氣是標準普爾500指數中有史以來第五家做反向投資的公司。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1425325200023904259","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1425325200023904259","title":"What the fuck is wrong with everyone?
