The unusually stark wording from the company came in an interim earnings statement on Tuesday that confirmed a profit warning issued last week and outlined a series of measures to shore up its finances that include selling properties.  </p>\n\n<p>“The group has risks of defaults on borrowings and cases of litigation outside of its normal course of business,” Evergrande said, adding that it would pursue further asset sales, control costs and seek to attract new investors.  The warning comes as Evergrande experiences the worst upheaval in its history, with a stream of recent problems raising questions over its access to financing, forcing it to sell assets and earning it an unusual public rebuke from the government over its debt risks....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For those not aware, Evergrande is the largest real estate developer in the world. And it&#39;s arguably the largest real estate developer in the largest real estate bubble in the world.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sharing this because <strong><em>if</em></strong> this were to default, it could be a trigger for some much larger market turmoil. Evergrande represents potential systemic risk both in China as well as the global financial markets. IE, this defaulting <strong><em>could</em></strong> be a bit of a Lehman-esque type moment.</p>\n\n<p>With that out of the way, I want to be very clear - <strong>**this is NOT likely to default*\\</strong>* since the strong likelihood is that it will get a bailout due to the system wide risk attached to it for China.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, history has a lot of examples of policy mistakes, or attempts to control asset bubbles that simply end up popping the bubble. I stated this a few months ago, but the current attempt from Chinese policymakers to control debt and reduce economic risk is a tightrope walk, and there are legitimate risks of overtightening. With that said, China has a LOT of control over all the levers in their financial system, so if any country would be able to stop a cascade, it&#39;s likely China.</p>\n\n<p>The result is that this is more likely to be a bottom for Chinese markets assuming it gets a bailout. But there is a small tail chance that the complete opposite happens and things really fall apart. Since that chance is larger than normal (but still not large) and the magnitude of effects are enormous if it were to occur, it&#39;s something that&#39;s worth at least being aware of.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please at least try to refrain from making this into an ideological or political debate about China.  Given, sometimes these things merge into the financial realm of discussion, but at least try to take a neutral view of this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pgictj/heavily_indebted_chinese_developer_evergrande/","title":"Heavily indebted Chinese developer Evergrande warns of default risk","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-02T17:35:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-02 17:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pgictj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pgictj/heavily_indebted_chinese_developer_evergrande/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pgictj/heavily_indebted_chinese_developer_evergrande/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"cbus20122","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/cbus20122","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"cbus20122","score":512,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"多額の負債を抱える中国のデベロッパーEvergrande社がデフォルトリスクを警告","the_new_excerpt":"記事全文はこちら\n[https://www.ft.com/content/e870dd10-223c-411e-9e72-53c3b8e609b6]\n\n> エバーグランデは、資金調達ができない場合、債務不履行のリスクがあると警告している。\n> エバーグランドは、資金調達ができなければ債務不履行のリスクがあると警告している。\n> これは、中国で最も重債務を負っている不動産開発会社が、進行中の流動性危機を回避するために戦っているためです。異例のことですが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"负债累累的中国开发商恒大警告说有违约风险","the_new_excerpt":"在这里阅读完整的文章\n[https://www.ft.com/content/e870dd10-223c-411e-9e72-53c3b8e609b6]\n\n> 恒大警告说，如果不能筹集到资金，它就有违约的风险。\n> 这家中国负债最重的房地产开发商正在努力避免\n> 这家中国负债最多的房地产开发商正在努力避免流动性危机的发生。异常的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"負債累累的中國開發商恆大警告說有違約風險","the_new_excerpt":"在這裏閱讀完整的文章\n[https://www.ft.com/content/e870dd10-223c-411e-9e72-53c3b8e609b6]\n\n> 恆大警告說，如果不能籌集到資金，它就有違約的風險。\n> 這家中國負債最重的房地產開發商正在努力避免\n> 這家中國負債最多的房地產開發商正在努力避免流動性危機的發生。異常的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pghek6","excerpt":"Chargepoint Holdings Inc. disclosed Wednesday that its car-charging stations had\nproduced better sales than expected in the second quarter, and executives\nincreased their sales target for the year, sending shares more than 13% higher\nin after-hours trading.\n\nChargepoint reported a second-quarter…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pghek6/chargepoint_stock_charges_higher_after_sales_beat/","title":"Chargepoint stock charges higher after sales beat, increased forecast","date":"September 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Chargepoint社の株価は、売上高の増加と予想の増加により高くなりました。","the_new_excerpt":"Chargepoint Holdings Inc.は水曜日、同社の自動車用充電ステーションの第2四半期の売上高が予想を上回ったと発表しました。\n第2四半期の売上高が予想を上回ったことを発表しました。\n売り上げ目標を上方修正したことを明らかにし、株価は時間外取引で13％以上上昇しました。\n時間外取引で株価は13％以上上昇しました。\n\nChargepoint社は、第2四半期の売上高が予想を上回ったと発表しました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"销售业绩好转，提高预测后，Chargepoint股价冲高","the_new_excerpt":"Chargepoint Holdings Inc.周三披露，其汽车充电站的销售情况好于预期。\n第二季度的销售情况好于预期，而且高管们提高了今年的销售目标。\n高管们提高了今年的销售目标，使股价在盘后交易中上涨超过13%。\n股价在盘后交易中上涨超过13%。\n\nChargepoint报告说，第二季度...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"銷售業績好轉，提高預測後，Chargepoint股價衝高","the_new_excerpt":"Chargepoint Holdings Inc.週三披露，其汽車充電站的銷售情況好於預期。\n第二季度的銷售情況好於預期，而且高管們提高了今年的銷售目標。\n高管們提高了今年的銷售目標，使股價在盤後交易中上漲超過13%。\n股價在盤後交易中上漲超過13%。\n\nChargepoint報告說，第二季度...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pgkwnv","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pgkwnv/watching_that_stock_that_looks_good_but_could_be/","title":"Watching that stock that looks good but could be a bit too risky.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 02, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"良さそうだけど、ちょっとリスクが高すぎるかもしれない銘柄をウォッチしています。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"观察那只看起来不错但可能有点太冒险的股票。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"觀察那隻看起來不錯但可能有點太冒險的股票。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pgictj","previousId":"RedditPost-pghek6","nextId":"RedditPost-pgkwnv","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pgictj/heavily_indebted_chinese_developer_evergrande/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
