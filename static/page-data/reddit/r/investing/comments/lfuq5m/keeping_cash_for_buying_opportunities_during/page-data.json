Example: March/April 2020, they invested $10k instead of the normal $1k that they normally would. Is this a mistake (waiting for a downturn)? Or is it better to increase the monthly dollar cost averaging amount invested and only keep in cash what you actually need in regular savings? Does keeping cash like that hurt you overtime (i.e opportunity cost of keeping cash)? Advice is appreciated! Also, side note, what is a healthy amount to keep in savings/cash for a rainy day (in terms of either salary or expenses) in your opinion?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lfuq5m/keeping_cash_for_buying_opportunities_during/","title":"Keeping cash for buying opportunities during market downturns","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T08:54:00.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 08:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"0b26c63d-4ddd-54b0-acb1-1c311e84c32e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfuq5m/keeping_cash_for_buying_opportunities_during/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lfuq5m/keeping_cash_for_buying_opportunities_during/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Ghost7887","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ghost7887","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Ghost7887","score":227,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"保留现金，在市场低迷时把握买入机会","the_new_excerpt":"我听几位同事说，他们喜欢把大约一万多块钱放在。\n额外的现金/储蓄，以应对 \"停机时间 \"或 \"市场调整\"。例子：3月/4月 3月/4月\n2020年，他们投资了1万块钱，而不是平时的1千块钱。是\n这是个错误（等待下跌）？还是更好...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"保留現金，在市場低迷時把握買入機會","the_new_excerpt":"我聽幾位同事說，他們喜歡把大約一萬多塊錢放在。\n額外的現金/儲蓄，以應對 \"停機時間 \"或 \"市場調整\"。例子：3月/4月 3月/4月\n2020年，他們投資了1萬塊錢，而不是平時的1千塊錢。是\n這是個錯誤（等待下跌）？還是更好...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-2a0a446c-4a2f-51f2-88be-9bda382bdbbe","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfq44i/in_the_end_they_will_drown_in_debt/","title":"In the end they will drown (in debt).","date":"February 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"最后他们会淹死（债务）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"最後他們會淹死（債務）。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-30b1f408-f3d8-5376-8ec9-7b8ca624330f","excerpt":"I have never ever had a weed stock in my portfolio and semiconductors and CRM\ntools are my main area of analysis, but $TLRY is looking like an absolute move.\nI thought about getting in at $8, now it’s $29.
