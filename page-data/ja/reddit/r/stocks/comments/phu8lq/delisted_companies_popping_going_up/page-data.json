DOn&#39;t get me banned! </p>\n\n<p>----------------</p>\n\n<p>I made a post yesterday trying to buy shares of delisted stock (basically Blockbuster and Sears ) but it was removed. Maybe because it was considered penny cuz it was, duh, worth pennies! SORRY MODS!</p>\n\n<p>Trying to continue that question/topic so I can learn better: I know I cannot buy these shares (bummer!). But is it common for delisted companies that retail cannot buy to jump up so big? I mean, these companies are &quot;bankrupt&quot; and facing liquidation, so they technically should not go up at all. Whatever is remaining should be sold to pay down debt, etc. In fact, if facing liquidation, why are they trading in the first place? Retail cannot buy in, so, who is gaining from BLIAQ and SHLDQ going up?</p>\n\n<p>-------------------</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: I&#39;m dating myself here, but I loved Blockbuster when it was around. Even before streaming, with Netflix mail in DVDs, I still went to my local Blockbuster to check out videos and rent videos and videogames. So yea, it wasn&#39;t &#39;dying&#39; to me, which might be a small niche population. I still go to my local book store to buy my books and in my company, we always try to purchase from small businesses first.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: &quot;To protect investors&quot; was a lot of comments previously; but I had positions in BABA and also VIAC and I did not feel protected when it plummeted, so now I&#39;m calloused and put money aside for these &quot;stock bets&quot; (not options), even if it&#39;s just a few k.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: People telling me to just put it into index / ETFs; yes, I have those too. I&#39;m not looking for 7-10% a year. I&#39;m looking for some quick buck or two to feed into my FIRE. Happy with making 2-3% a month, but have been doing roughly 8-9% monthly. Also, these are for my leisure trading hobby. In at open, out when my target is reached , around 30-40%. Sometimes, I don&#39;t hold more than a day or two. I have a day job which is pretty stress free and gives me time to day trade (and learn about stuff).</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Amazon vs (anyone): Yes, I saw the post in the other subreddit. This is NOT about that. My household does not have Prime, but I do give props to them for giving small businesses a store front to sell product, much like what eBay did many moons ago.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Thank you to folks sending me to that video game stock. I read the Due Diligence there. This is NOT about that.</p>\n\n<p>MODS: I mark this as industry discussion to learn more. Let me know if this question is out of place or which words to remove and I&#39;ll edit!!!!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/phu8lq/delisted_companies_popping_going_up/","title":"Delisted companies popping (going up)?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-05T02:37:38.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-05 02:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"phu8lq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/phu8lq/delisted_companies_popping_going_up/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/phu8lq/delisted_companies_popping_going_up/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Conscious_Wolf","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Conscious_Wolf","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Conscious_Wolf","score":80,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"上場廃止企業が飛び出す（上がる）？","the_new_excerpt":"EDIT: ルール7に準拠するために、ストックティッカーの記述をすべて削除しました。これはただの\n勉強のためです! ティッカーの話はやめてください!
