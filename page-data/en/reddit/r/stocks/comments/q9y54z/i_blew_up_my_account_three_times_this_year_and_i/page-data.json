Since those people probably just stop posting on forums when it happens. So I&#39;m swallowing the pride and posting about my losses. </p>\n\n<p>I started invested January 5 this year as a New Year&#39;s resolution. I got Rich Dad Poor dad youtube video recommended to me and didnt realize I had been spending my money on liabilities all this time. I went heavy into SPACs, Cathie Wood stocks, biotech, and I got into AMC due to the &quot;recovery&quot; stock trade that was all over CNBC. I somehow didnt have a red day with those stocks for 15 straight days and the turning point was WSB looking at short interest and pumping several stocks late January. And Robinhood shutting off the buy option. I had just started investing and didn&#39;t realize at the time that turning off buying pressure meant the stocks would tank. And that was my first blow up. My portfolio dropped 35% in a day. That day was January 28th.</p>\n\n<p>I started following WSB since while my account blew up it seemed their stocks were getting massive gains. So I went all in on weed stocks. And I recovered my losses. But I didnt take profits and I had another blow up on February 10th. My account had another 35% drop. As I was in options and the entire weed sector crashed in premarket. So by the time I could sell it was too late.</p>\n\n<p>With what I now know I should have had trailing stop losses if I was in momentum stocks but I decided after the weed stock crash to go all in on tech stocks to name some of them CRWD, AAPL, MSFT, CRWD, NET, and SE. It worked for 2 months I had somehow recovered my losses for the third time. Then around the week of 4/20 there started to be inflation panic and those stocks tanked. Stock subs and CNBC were calling tech stocks terrible at the time and after three weeks of constant losses and my account blew up for the third time I sold all my stocks around May 10-13. Which in retrospect was a bottom.</p>\n\n<p>So I got back into stocks the following week May 17th. And I stopped following WSB stock picks, did my own DD, and have a diversified portfolio and a Roth IRA with index funds. But Im sick to my stomach since im down still down 40% overall 5 months later. When I gave up on WSB stocks that meant I sold AMC in February which if I had I held that would have recovered all my losses from the May panic sell at the bottom. Now once a month there is FUD that the market is overvalued and there is gonna be a crash on stock subs and CNBC. And im like wtf I already dealt with three crashes that just gets swept under the rug with SPACs, weed stocks, and several small cap stocks losing like 70% of their value since Febuary. It just feels like it is a different market from my first two months and I messed up not taking profits on three occasions. My portfolio would have been up 500% instead im down 40%.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/q9y54z/i_blew_up_my_account_three_times_this_year_and_i/","title":"I blew up my account three times this year and I feel sick to the stomach since im not sure if I will recover from the third anytime soon.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"October 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-17T18:58:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-17 18:58","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q9y54z","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q9y54z/i_blew_up_my_account_three_times_this_year_and_i/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q9y54z/i_blew_up_my_account_three_times_this_year_and_i/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"AbuSaho","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AbuSaho","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"AbuSaho","score":153,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今年に入ってから3回もアカウントを爆破してしまい、3回目の爆破からすぐに立ち直れるかどうかわからないので、胃が痛くなっています。","the_new_excerpt":"おそらくよくあることだと思いますが、そのような投稿はほとんど見られません。滅多にありません\n負けた人の声を聞くこともありません。そういう人たちは、そういうことがあるとフォーラムに投稿するのをやめてしまうでしょうから\n掲示板に投稿しなくなるからです。だから私はプライドを飲み込んで、自分の負けについて投稿しています。\n\n新年の抱負として今年の1月5日から投資を始めました。I...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"今年我的账户被炸毁了三次，我感到恶心，因为我不确定我是否会很快从第三次中恢复过来。","the_new_excerpt":"这种情况可能经常发生，但我很少看到关于它的帖子。你很少\n听到那些失败者的声音。因为那些人可能只是在发生这种情况时停止在论坛上发帖\n当它发生时。所以我忍气吞声，发帖讲述我的损失。\n\n我从今年1月5日开始投资，作为新年的一个决议。I...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"今年我的賬戶被炸燬了三次，我感到噁心，因爲我不確定我是否會很快從第三次中恢復過來。","the_new_excerpt":"這種情況可能經常發生，但我很少看到關於它的帖子。你很少\n聽到那些失敗者的聲音。因爲那些人可能只是在發生這種情況時停止在論壇上發帖\n當它發生時。所以我忍氣吞聲，發帖講述我的損失。\n\n我從今年1月5日開始投資，作爲新年的一個決議。I...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qa0gue","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qa0gue/best_way_to_learn_how_to_trade/","title":"Best way to learn how to trade.","date":"October 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"トレード方法を学ぶには最高の方法です。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"学习如何交易的最佳方式。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"學習如何交易的最佳方式。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q9rga5","excerpt":"I recently read in a few articles about lithium growing in demand, and will\ncontinue to grow in demand over the years, with the increase of EVs.
