However as a start thinking about retiring one day I’d like to be a little more conservative keep my principal and invest in something that pays dividends. So I started to do a little bit of due diligence, full disclosure I have about 20+ years till retirement. So what I was looking into is ones that pay dividends, I ran across $GOF.  It’s about $20/share and pays monthly dividends of $0.182.  </p>\n\n<p>My question is: if you invest $1MM in GOF you’ll have 50,000 share and generate $9,100 (50,000 x 0.182) per month.  The price is stable and expense ratio is low.  Is this correct?</p>\n\n<p>With my S&amp;P 500 investments and my tenure till retirement, I can expect liberally a 10% per year return. And the way I’m investing, I could assume (hypothetical) $5MM by the time I retire.  Using the GOF example I’d able to generate ~$45,000 per month....  this just seems unreal</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lrxyap/need_some_guidance_if_it_sounds_too_good_then_its/","title":"Need some guidance, if it sounds too good then it’s probably not true...","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-25T17:57:10.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-25 17:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"a190e58f-f08c-5c41-ad53-e56bb378ae6d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrxyap/need_some_guidance_if_it_sounds_too_good_then_its/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrxyap/need_some_guidance_if_it_sounds_too_good_then_its/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"lecherofahq","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lecherofahq","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lecherofahq","score":51,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"需要一些指导，如果听起来太美好，那么可能不是真的...","the_new_excerpt":"我从来没有投资过专注于分红的基金，我坚持以\n标普500指数和其他大盘指数基金。然而作为一个开始考虑退休\n有一天，我想更保守一点 保持我的本金和投资。\n的东西，支付红利。所以我开始做一点...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"需要一些指導，如果聽起來太美好，那麼可能不是真的...","the_new_excerpt":"我從來沒有投資過專注於分紅的基金，我堅持以\n標普500指數和其他大盤指數基金。然而作爲一個開始考慮退休\n有一天，我想更保守一點 保持我的本金和投資。\n的東西，支付紅利。所以我開始做一點...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f56c95d1-8afe-56a4-be68-01f483eeb1ee","excerpt":"GME Megathread Part 2\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsc5ji/gme_megathread_part_2_for_thursday_february_25th/?sort=new]","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls63oa/gme_megathread_for_thursday_february_25th_2021/","title":"GME Megathread for Thursday February 25th, 2021","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2021年2月25日（星期四）GME Megathread。","the_new_excerpt":"GME Megathread Part 2\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsc5ji/gme_megathread_part_2_for_thursday_february_25th/?sort=new]","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年2月25日（星期四）GME Megathread。","the_new_excerpt":"GME Megathread Part 2\n[https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsc5ji/gme_megathread_part_2_for_thursday_february_25th/?sort=new]","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-f28bf1c8-ee78-5c27-8814-94e87197852e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8o2m/lots_of_ass_tattoos_coming_soon/","title":"Lots of Ass Tattoos coming soon!","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"大量的屁股纹身即将到来!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"大量的屁股紋身即將到來!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-a190e58f-f08c-5c41-ad53-e56bb378ae6d","previousId":"RedditPost-f56c95d1-8afe-56a4-be68-01f483eeb1ee","nextId":"RedditPost-f28bf1c8-ee78-5c27-8814-94e87197852e","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lrxyap/need_some_guidance_if_it_sounds_too_good_then_its/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
