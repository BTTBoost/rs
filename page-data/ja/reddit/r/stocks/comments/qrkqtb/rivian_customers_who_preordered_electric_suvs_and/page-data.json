He has no idea when he’ll get his vehicle, called the R1S, but his down payment is paying off in a very different way. As a pre-order customer, Patel was able to buy into Rivian’s IPO on Tuesday night as part of the company’s directed share program. He purchased the maximum 175 shares for $13,650 at the $78 IPO price. After the stock popped 29% on Wednesday, Patel’s stake is now worth $17,628. “When I invest in these companies, I’m always a long hold guy,” said Patel, 45, adding that he invested in Tesla not long after its 2010 IPO and also bought shares in Lucid Motors, which went public in July. “I’m definitely not a meme stock guy. With these three, I feel good about the tech.” The tech is all Patel can currently bet on. Following its Nasdaq debut on Wednesday, Rivian has a market cap of $86 billion, higher than Ford and about equal to General Motors, even though the company is projecting revenue of between zero and $1 million for the third quarter. Rivian reserved up to 7% of the IPO shares for DSP participants, as the company laid out in its prospectus. Eligible investors fell into two categories: People who reserved either an R1S or an R1T electric truck as of Sept. 30, and company officers, directors and their affiliates. The deposits are refundable.</p>\n\n<p>The program follows similar moves by Airbnb, Uber and Doximity, which set aside shares in their offerings for hosts, drivers and doctors, respectively. What sets Rivian’s DSP apart is that the EV company doesn’t have actual customers yet, despite a backlog of 55,400 pre-orders, as of Oct. 31. Assuming the DSP allocated all its available shares, participants collectively invested about $835 million into Rivian’s stock. As of Wednesday’s close, those shares are worth a total of close to $1.08 billion, representing a paper gain of around $245 million.</p>\n\n<p>Joshua White, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University, said it’s a great deal for those who can participate because hot IPO stocks almost always enjoy a first-day pop, and retail investors usually get shut out. DSP investors can also sell immediately if they choose because they’re not subject to a post-IPO lock-up period. “You kind of know going in this is going to be a pretty good sweetheart deal for customers who sign up,” said White, who previously served as an economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Not having a product, it’s a way to extend some goodwill upfront so they can lock in those returns right away.” Patel received his first email about Rivian’s DSP last month and was told he needed to pre-register by Oct. 25. The program was being run by Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter on the IPO. After the stock priced at $78 late Tuesday, Patel was able to go into his Morgan Stanley account and select how many shares he wanted, up to 175. He selected the max and transferred the money.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qrkqtb/rivian_customers_who_preordered_electric_suvs_and/","title":"Rivian customers who pre-ordered electric SUVs and trucks were able to buy pre-ipo shares and made millions from IPO pop","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-11T15:48:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-11 15:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qrkqtb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qrkqtb/rivian_customers_who_preordered_electric_suvs_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qrkqtb/rivian_customers_who_preordered_electric_suvs_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"WickedSensitiveCrew","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/WickedSensitiveCrew","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"WickedSensitiveCrew","score":368,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"電気自動車のSUVやトラックを予約したRivian社の顧客は、事前にIPO株を購入することができ、IPOポップで数百万円を稼いだ。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/rivian-pre-order-customers-made-over-240-million-in-profit-on-ipo-pop.html\n\nテキサス州オースティンで環境コンサルタントをしている Rajiv Patel は、今年初めに電気自動車 Rivian を購入するために 1,000 ドルの頭金を払いました。\n今年の初めに、電気自動車のSUV「Rivian」を購入するために1,000ドルの頭金を払いました。R1Sと呼ばれるこの車がいつ手に入るのか、彼にはわかりません。\nR1Sと呼ばれるこの車がいつ手に入るかはわかりませんが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"预先订购电动SUV和卡车的Rivian客户能够购买pre-ipo股票，并从IPO中赚取数百万美元的收益","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/rivian-pre-order-customers-made-over-240-million-in-profit-on-ipo-pop.html\n\n德克萨斯州奥斯汀市的环境顾问拉吉夫-帕特尔(Rajiv Patel)今年早些时候为一辆Rivian电动SUV支付了1000美元的定金。\n定金，买了一辆Rivian电动SUV。他不知道自己何时能\n得到他的车辆，称为R1S，但...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"預先訂購電動SUV和卡車的Rivian客戶能夠購買pre-ipo股票，並從IPO中賺取數百萬美元的收益","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/rivian-pre-order-customers-made-over-240-million-in-profit-on-ipo-pop.html\n\n德克薩斯州奧斯汀市的環境顧問拉吉夫-帕特爾(Rajiv Patel)今年早些時候爲一輛Rivian電動SUV支付了1000美元的定金。\n定金，買了一輛Rivian電動SUV。他不知道自己何時能\n得到他的車輛，稱爲R1S，但...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qr88fh","excerpt":"> In its full-year earnings call today, Disney CEO Bob Chapek brought up the\n> idea of the metaverse to shareholders for the first time.
