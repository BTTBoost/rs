Before everyone thinks ok boomer or that I&amp;#39;m some value investor dumping my entire net worth into BABA I&amp;#39;m not. I&amp;#39;m asking on a theoretical level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, valuations and fundamentals have mattered because the big institutions and the average retail investor thought they mattered. Even algos, which on some level were active at the onset of the 80&amp;#39;s were programmed and directed to sell off stock when the valuation became too absurd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I look at the Rivians and Nikolas of the world I start to think maybe they&amp;#39;re just a symptom of the larger mentality of the market, including institutions, including the algos that are programmed by humans that have normal human biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, if the larger consensus of the market.. from institutions to retail to the programmers making algos, was that only future potential growth mattered and nothing else, wouldn&amp;#39;t that theoretically mean that only growth and hype stocks would have growth and interest forever? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean on a purely theoretical level, if we reached a point where it was a consensus by the vast majority of investors from all levels and backgrounds was that speculation and growth wins the day, wouldn&amp;#39;t the market reflect that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean to say is the market can be a reflection of the risk appetite of the broad spectrum of humans investing and trading in it, and if that were to slowly shift would it be possible that value stocks or old blue chips are largely forgotten forever, or have a bad return versus hype/speculation/growth moving forward?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no one is a Warren Buffett anymore, why would Warren Buffett-esque stocks have any market beating returns? No one would invest in them (on a level compared to hype/speculation stocks). They&amp;#39;d just theoretically sit there at low valuations forever paying out dividends and what not, with their only real growth being from stock buy backs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a musing I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an econ prof who told my class that in the long run, he believed that inflation and money supply growth would match up. Many people tend to agree with this classical theory, so I took a few hours and looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found was that m2 money supply, since 1961 has compounded annually at about 7.1% while CPI inflation has compounded annually at about 3.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, based on the above facts I&amp;#39;d argue that, over the past 60 years inflation and money supply haven&amp;#39;t shown a relationship approximating the classical economic theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s assume that $TSLA is NOT one of the most overvalued mega cap ever as many argue and &lt;strong&gt;I agree it is overvalued by a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. Not a huge TSLA fan here...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But ....let&amp;#39;s assume TSLA is fairly valued.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current market cap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$TSLA: 1T&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$RIVN: 127B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ratio of market cap: 7.8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to judge RIVN on current (near zero) revenue. Let&amp;#39;s look at 2 years out and 9 years out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conservative forecast is that $TSLA can add &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/09/tesla-growth-in-the-next-two-years-2022-2023/&quot;&gt;1.21M&lt;/a&gt; vehicles to its yearly production. This is based on actual plants in/soon-to-be in production. Assuming 2021Q4 will grow at 15% over 2021Q3 (same growth from Q2 to Q3), TSLA would have produced 900M vehicles this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSLA 2021: 900M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TSLA 2023: 2.11M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TSLA 2030: Elon projects 20M&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be super optimistic, I will get back to it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand for TSLA? TSLA does not have a demand issue as Elon. For example, currently TSLA is the second largest EV in *CHINA*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s Look at RIVIAN ($RIVN) production forecast according to its own CEO, however ambitious and optimistic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIVN 2023: &lt;a href=&quot;https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/&quot;&gt;CEO projects 200K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIVN 2030:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CEO projects at least 1M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Car production:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether in 2023 or 2030, TSLA will produce at least 10X as RIVN. I say at least because TSLA can prove based on current plans capacity it can deliver 2.1M in 2023, RIVN CEO cannot really prove that, but let&amp;#39;s take his work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much hype has been made about RIVN because F and AMZN invested in it. And AMZN has committed to purchase 100K vehicles over the next 5 years. Let&amp;#39;s put things into perspective: &lt;strong&gt;TSLA has proved its popularity in CHINA, EUROPE, and US vs. RIVN has a contract with AMZN.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some misunderstanding by retail investors about RIVN:&lt;/strong&gt; Just because F and AMZN backed RIVN does not mean they will be giving RIVN free money OK?  IF that guarantees that RIVN can finance with future rounds (good thing), this will dilute your shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other production&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike TSLA, RIVN is ONLY a car company. TSLA produces solar, batteries, software, soon Lithium, + has proven it can navigate through shortages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think we all agree - even TSLA haters - that Elon is one of the smartest most innovative, most ambitious visionary with a long track record of success after success. We know nothing about Scaringe. He is definitely a smart guy, but it would be extremely extremely optimistic to think he can one up Elon on innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally we can talk about returns on your investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIVN remains largely pre-revenue, it has not proven itself yet. Therefore investors RIVN which is more risky play, needs to deliver higher returns than TSLA. &lt;strong&gt;No one would invest in a pre-revenue company if its expected return on investment does not exceed  more mature companies.&lt;/strong&gt; Would you invest in TSLA if the returns on its stock is not going to exceed that of KO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2030 TSLA/RIVN Car production only &lt;strong&gt;= 20x.&lt;/strong&gt; Let&amp;#39;s say Elon is too optimistic about 2030 and Scaringe is conservative, &lt;strong&gt;let&amp;#39;s say it is 15X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currently the market cap is only 7.8 X half of production ratio.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that even if TSLA&amp;#39;s non-car production (solar, software, chips, etc) does not materialize and is equal to zero (against all evidence) ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR/CONCLUSION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At fair valuation in 2030 &lt;strong&gt;with extremely generous assumption to RIVN&lt;/strong&gt; compared to TSLA &lt;strong&gt;the returns on your RIVN investment will be HALF of that of TSLA&lt;/strong&gt;.. (1+x)=2*(1+y)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the return on your TSLA stock is 100% ===&amp;gt; $RVN will be 0%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the return on your TSLA stock is 50% ===&amp;gt; $RVN will be -25%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the return on your TSLA stock is 0% ===&amp;gt; $RVN will be -50%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF TSLA crashes by 30% as some TSLA skeptics such as me believe it is possible, RIVN will have to crash by 65%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this is under the assumption that TSLA (like RIVN) is only a car company and that RIVN will meet and exceed its goals in comparison to TSLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you invest in a pre-revenue company with lower returns than a mature company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Meat will fail as a company. To me it was clear after they failed to deliver on chicken substitutes, which should have been easier to land and expand with but they didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

She is one of the best money managers I know. For example she spent over a month researching which car to buy, and caught the car salesmen twice trying to sneak higher prices past her during negotiation. She is the perfect person I would expect to be a boglehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is currently sitting on $60k in cold hard cash, that she has been building up for over 3 years. I knew she must have some but I didn&amp;#39;t know it was this much. I introduced her to the bogleheads philosophy, sent her a link to The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, sent her a link to the bogleheads forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was about 6 months ago. I have tried to engage her since then, but she just does not seem interested in the topic. Which is even more infuriating because that&amp;#39;s exactly the type of person who should be investing in low cost index funds. Someone who literally doesn&amp;#39;t care and will only check it every 5 years or so. She said she is too scared to invest, too risk adverse. I tried to tell her (and her sisters) that in fact the riskier thing by far is to not invest. But I don&amp;#39;t seem to be getting through to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is still kind of young, so I think she thinks she still has time, but my analytical brain is on fire thinking of the compounding interest she is losing out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else faced this issue? How do I convince her what she is doing, while it may feel safe, is actually way more dangerous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: I should clarify that I am NOT trying to force Bogleheads philosophy on my sister-in-law. I&amp;#39;m not even really a Boglehead myself, although I do admire and desire to be a Boglehead. I have had maybe 3 conversations with her about investing, each less than 5 minutes long. This post is about my anxiety and concern for my family&amp;#39;s financial health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother became very ill when I was 20 years old, and was forced into early retirement. She didn&amp;#39;t have enough saved up by then to survive on her own. It has been very tough for me to witness, and I think my fears are coming out in anxiety when I see other people I love make decisions that might set them up for a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;

What the ever loving fuck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is going on here? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my theory, and I’ll preface this by saying I’m not a crypto expert, but I am the owner of a large PR firm, and I’ve seen the underbelly of how media works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s happening here is that we are witnessing the extraordinary power of meme based communities centered around highly memeable content. The power comes from two places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meme creates very strong in-group dynamics. Look no further than the popularity of meme based (not memecoin) based subreddits. Memes spread like wildfire even when financial incentive isn’t involved. This creates hyper active communities that build strong ties extremely quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memes themselves are viral loops. Any community user creating memes is a potential source of new virality for the meme, or memecoin. This is an exponential flywheel and this is what most miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these groups ramp up, you inevitably get people with media power joining, including journalist with big audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be happening with dogebonk and perhaps a few others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memecoin market is an insane Wild West, and everyone should fully expect them all to potentially be scams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we already know the proliferating power of memes, so to expect memecoins to not be able to leverage that huge power, is to be blind to the clown world crypto enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 years ago I had my wife set up a ISA (UK equivalent of ROTH IRA), she invested with a lumpsum and has been contributing a little under 10% of her salary to it each month since. Currently sitting on returns of just under 58%, she owns direct equities in 5 other companies (small values under £1000) with mixed fortunes. One small cap mining has performed well the others well below the rate of inflation and 1 has negative returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been encouraging her to sell (no tax implications) and reinvest into her vangaurd portfolio as a lumpum but she is emotionally attached to the success of her picks and does not want to sell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you kind folks send me some specific article and studies on passive strategy vs direct stocks? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to reason, explained compounded growth, opportunity loss but cannot get through to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich Millennials to Financial Advisers: Thanks for the Golf Invite, but You Can’t Invest My Money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WSJ recently wrote an article about it, you can easily find an article if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear the same again and again: &amp;quot;anyone can do a job of an average financial advisor&amp;quot;. Below is a story of a person from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a group of 5 mutual funds and our decision to decide what fund to put them in was based on one question: “on a scale of 1-5, what is your risk tolerance”. We asked every single client this and based on their answer plus their age, income and savings we put them in one of those  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought even a monkey could do my job at first but was amazed how many clients wouldn’t invest at all and just had their money sitting in cash. I wondered how even without an advisor why people couldn’t/wouldn’t pick pretty much any mutual fund and put their money there  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got paid based on how much I got people to invest and thought it would be easy money to convince people to make their assets grow but it was damn hard. Most clients had money in a CD and would refuse to move it &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought of going to money managers? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you tried - what was the experience like?&lt;/p&gt;

My gut feeling tells me that if everyone flocks to one thing, there must be something fishy about it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t lie, I&amp;#39;ve been tempted time and time again to jump in, seeing my friends make 10% in a single day and what not. I guess I am only human. However, after reading the works of Buffet, Howard Marks, Munger, and those gentlemen (which i consider my teachers), Tesla just seems to go against their philosophy; especially when it comes to the margin of safety principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Tesla is a special case, if we look at Tesla as a company, their debt is consistently decreasing, equity and profits are growing like crazy, all of that is good. It&amp;#39;s just the valuation. Currently at a P/E of ~300 for instance, it means they have A LOT to back up for in the near future and the public obviously has high hopes in them. But my question is, what exactly is this hope? I am not very informed about Tesla, neither am I an engineer, which is why I wanna hear some of your opinions about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- What is their specific moat when it comes to the electric cars? How will this moat be protected by other automobile dealers? (i.e the Germans, Ford, the Chinese, etc...) Is it just their brand or do they have superior technology that will actually be hard to replicate/improve by other companies in the coming 10 years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- What other ventures are they going into besides cars? Is it A.I? What constitutes as A.I? If it is a personal robot who does the dishes for you and cleans your house, in what way will they have superior engineers compared to the other giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft? And why will they perform better than them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, what is it that they do that makes people so confident in them, and what is it that accounts for this valuation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the articles states this which I thought was interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{Evergrande’s challenges could spread outside of China as well, as they ripple through global financial markets. On Monday, the Federal Reserve said troubles in China’s property sector could threaten the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through a deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States,” the Fed said in its twice-yearly update on the American financial system.} &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EVERGRANDE DID DEFAULT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/now/evergrande-officially-defaulted-dmsa-preparing-161200818.html&quot;&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/now/evergrande-officially-defaulted-dmsa-preparing-161200818.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am seriously concerned on the reasons why evergrande’s default is being silenced, and what this means for the market as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a stock goes up by a dollar or around 5%, they say dumb crap like, &amp;quot;this stock has surged today.&amp;quot; or ascended, or spiked, or is sky rocketing. But like, the stock I was looking at had an ipo price of $12 and now it&amp;#39;s $4 and its apparently &amp;quot;skyrocketing.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;like no, no it&amp;#39;s not. if I&amp;#39;m an investor from day one, and I read the phrase skyrocket, I&amp;#39;m thinking this thing is like $100 a share or something. Like the people who write these articles, I don&amp;#39;t know how they get paid for this. These analysts are paid to type nonsense every single day, but they aren&amp;#39;t paid to be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if there was some enforced rules to these fancy adjectives. Because i see it with every company. They say plummet, or downward spiral, or falling when a company goes down even 1%, but jettisoned, surged, or sky rocket when it&amp;#39;s doing mildly good. I think it&amp;#39;s meant to keep people nervous and excited so people keep buying and selling and eventually make no money in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

And of course it rallied into the money by as much as $150.40 by 3:30pm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I immediately called support and after a run around they called me back after the market closed saying that the risk assessment team made the decision to close. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why wouldn’t they send a notification ahead of time stating that by a certain time they would close the position? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing… They sold right before the stock rallied into close. The CSR offered zero condolences or any modicum of help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks advanced firmly on Friday, with market participants continuing to balance better-than-expected corporate earnings amid rising inflation. The S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.75% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.05%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) broke a three day losing streak to finish 0.51% higher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Friday’s close, the SPY closed the week 0.4% lower following volatility after the release of the October Consumer Price Index. However, after five consecutive weeks of gains, the market remains marginally below previous all-time highs. The QQQ closed the week 0.91% lower, while the DIA closed the week 0.97% lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a rise in inflation was expected, the pace of the increase surprised to the upside. If the pace of increase is not moderated soon, it carries meaningful implications for corporations, consumers, and the Federal Reserve. As input costs rise, companies will pass the increase in cost to consumers to preserve their bottom line, who will be forced to pay the higher prices. The Fed would then be forced to step in and rise interest rates, which will makes the cost to borrow money more expensive, which means people and companies will likely spend less, leading to a fall in demand for goods and services. A rise in interest rates would particularly hurt high P/E tech stocks that have been flying in the last two years, as these companies rely on borrowing to fund their aggressive expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the Federal Reserve and many economists have reaffirmed that the inflationary pressures are transitory, caused by pandemic-era disruptions in global trade and will eventually ease, albeit while likely settling at a higher level than had been present before the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabriela Santos, Global Market Strategist at JP Morgan, said “Inflation should moderate. We’re talking about settling at 2%, 2.5% over the course of the next 12 months. So we&amp;#39;re still talking about real wage gains, and that&amp;#39;s extremely supportive, certainly of people&amp;#39;s livelihoods, but also of consumption and hence the economy overall. We do expect a big re-acceleration in growth starting this quarter and throughout next year, [and] 5% average growth just over the next three quarters. So we would characterize this not as stagflation, but as reflation. And that difference is, reflation is actually quite good for earnings growth and quite good for the stock market, especially cyclical sectors.&amp;quot; So far, expectations are that the Fed will step in sometime mid-2022 to raise interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shares of Rivian (RIVN), which is backed by Ford and Amazon,  continue to be on absolute fire. The company, which is expected to lose $1.28 billion on no more than $1 million in revenue this quarter, now has a market cap of more than $100 billion. For perspective, they are now the fourth largest automaker in the world by market cap. I’m not a stickler for valuation, but this is absolute insanity and unsustainable. The company has not started production and is already priced to perfection, which they are bound to hit a snag with. I don’t think this price is sustainable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The University of Michigan’s closely monitored Consumer Sentiment survey showed the consumer sentiment index decreased to 66.8 from 71.7 in October, missing estimates of 72.5. Waning confidence reflects “ an escalating inflation rate and the growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation,” Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Snap (SNAP) investor sued the social media company alleging it downplayed how Apple’s (AAPL) change in privacy would affect revenue. Remember, the stock plummeted 25% after an earnings miss, citing Apple’s changes as hampering ad revenue. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After more than a decade of explosive growth, China&amp;#39;s Singles&amp;#39; Day, the world&amp;#39;s biggest online shopping fest, is losing its gloss and bracing for more modest growth in coming years, hurt by a slower economy and tighter regulatory scrutiny. Alibaba (BABA) said on Friday its sales - or gross merchandise value (GMV) - during the 11 day event grew 8.5%, the slowest rate ever and the first time it came under double-digits growth. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it rejected an exchange-traded fund from VanEck that would have tracked Bitc… spot prices directly. This would have stood in contrast to the ProShares ETF (BITO), which was approved and which only tracks futures rather than prices directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
