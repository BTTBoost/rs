Don&#39;t expect anyone to read this anyway.</p>\n\n<p>--- <strong>Everything depends on treasury bonds and inflation</strong> ---</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t look at the S&amp;P as a PE ratio, but as a yield, so it&#39;s 1:1 with bonds. For example the S&amp;P 500 has a 34.75 PE - in earnings yield 2.9% a year. The ratio between treasuries and the S&amp;P 500 is called BEER (bond equity earnings yield ratio). </p>\n\n<p>Currently a 10 year US treasury yields 1.4% and S&amp;P 2.9%. The yield on a treasury can&#39;t exceed stocks in the long run, who would buy stocks if they could do better in risk free bonds. S&amp;P comes with risk premium due to downturns. </p>\n\n<p>Treasury yield are near all-time lows due to a number of factors including COVID and the fed printing $120b/month to buy securities. Low treasury yields make S&amp;P look more attractive, driving up the price and down the yield. 2.9% is better then 1.4%.</p>\n\n<p>This relationship between treasuries, inflation and stock yields determines <em>everything.</em></p>\n\n<p>Money supply has expanded rapidly due to massive printing. M1 massively, M2 slightly so far. As the velocity of money increases with reopening it guarantees M2 expansion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL</a></p>\n\n<p>Wages are up, commodity prices are up which in conjunction with massive money printing <em>guarantees</em> inflation will at the very least run hotter then it was pre-2020 for an extended period of time. How hot... who knows? In 2019 it was 1.8%, so at a minimum we&#39;re looking at 2%, probably higher. Not hyper-inflation but hotter then before. This is a certainty. </p>\n\n<p>--- <strong>The debt burden</strong> ---</p>\n\n<p>The government funds itself with treasuries and so the yield it has to pay is a major deal. The US has $29t in debt, at a 1.4% yield that&#39;s $400b/year in interest payments. Manageable. At 14%, as it was in the 80s, that&#39;s $4t a year, almost as much as the entire yearly $6.5t budget. Unmanageable. </p>\n\n<p>This massive debt expansion gives very little room for the fed to manoeuvre, which makes it very predictable. The fed <em>cannot</em> allow inflation run too hot as it would bankrupt America. </p>\n\n<p>Given a choice between crashing the market and inflation it will crash the market. It does not have the option to do anything else, it cannot let yields rise significantly. </p>\n\n<p>--- <strong>So what does this mean for stocks?</strong> ---</p>\n\n<p>Remember: Inflation rate &lt; Treasury yields &lt; S&amp;P yields</p>\n\n<p>PE ratios going up over last 30 years is not the result of investors randomly deciding stocks are worth more. It&#39;s the result of low inflation, therefore low treasury yields, therefore low S&amp;P yields, therefore PE going up, therefore stocks going up. </p>\n\n<p>The US economy in real terms has been barely growing, a couple percent a year at best, the massive bull run over the last decade is not a sign of economic prosperity, it&#39;s almost purely multiple expansion. We&#39;re at one end of the pendulum and now it has to swing back.  </p>\n\n<p>Inflation guaranteed to go up = treasury yields guaranteed to go up = S&amp;P yield guaranteed to go up (PE ratio going down). </p>\n\n<p>The yield on a treasury can&#39;t trail inflation significantly and historically has sat above inflation. There are less buyers for something guaranteed to lose purchasing power every year. </p>\n\n<p>That means if inflation sits at 2.5% we&#39;re looking at treasury yields at a minimum of 3-4%. Which means S&amp;P yield (currently 2.9%) has to sit up around 5-6%. This would involve the S&amp;P losing <em>half</em> its value from relatively small absolute changes to inflation. </p>\n\n<p>Even the fed estimates inflation to be 4% in 2021 and 2% going forward which will be the absolute best case scenario. 2% inflation would still cause at least a 20% drop in stocks, probably much more.</p>\n\n<p>--- <strong>Conclusion</strong> ---</p>\n\n<p>Inflation running hotter is a mathematic certainty. Treasury yields going up is a mathematic certainty. S&amp;P PE ratio (and therefore stock price) coming down is a mathematic certainty. </p>\n\n<p>The fed can choose to either fight inflation and crash the market, or let inflation run free and support the market. It will mostly choose the former, however we will see a bit of both. Inflation will run hotter then expected and stocks will fall.</p>\n\n<p>The market won&#39;t crash all at once bar some unforeseeable event, this won&#39;t happen overnight, it will gradually wheeze down as treasury yields adjust to the asset purchase taper and inflation ticking up. I am naming the upcoming event <strong>&quot;The Great Wheeze&quot;</strong> and I expect everybody to call it this.</p>\n\n<p>The underlying economy will keep ticking along relatively normal as before, so barely growing in real terms, but stocks will spend years in decline as treasury yields rise. People will recommend 60/40 stock/bond portfolios again. If you are looking to work in investment banks ask to join the bond division. </p>\n\n<p>I predict this will start within 12 months, probably accelerate early-mid next year and continue. </p>\n\n<p>--- <strong>Is there a way to make money from this?</strong> ---</p>\n\n<p>The problem with everything bubbles is there&#39;s less opportunity. Almost everyone is going to take a hit.</p>\n\n<p>Diversify away from US stocks, invest in low PE foreign markets with high underlying growth to counteract PE compression. Economies that aren&#39;t to dependant on exporting to the US is best. We&#39;re at the cusp of a new era in investment that will be defined by international markets. Commodity and defensive value stocks with decent dividends are probably solid.</p>\n\n<p>The other option is to hedge with 20-40% of your portfolio. Hedge against treasury yields going up (hello Burry) and the market going down. Goofy valuation stocks will fall the most. The problem is the market can stay irrational for extended periods of time.</p>\n\n<p>Holding cash is ok, but inflation will start to eat into its purchasing power. There&#39;s not going to be a sudden dip and then rebound, it will wheeze out for years, as it&#39;s not caused by some temporary recoverable event like COVID or the GFC, it&#39;s caused by the economic equivalent of gravity.  </p>\n\n<p>The other option is markets don&#39;t collapse in uniform. Typically there&#39;s a cascade of collapse that starts at fringe markets and heads inwards towards the core. If you&#39;re holding stocks pre-collapse, selling them and buying in sectors that have already collapsed is another play.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck fellas, catch you on the other side.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/pwvway/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/","title":"The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-28T10:41:40.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-28 10:41","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pwvway","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pwvway/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pwvway/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"ini0n","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ini0n","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ini0n","score":453,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"グレート・マーケット・ウィーズはもうすぐやってくる","the_new_excerpt":"超人気になるとは思っていないが、記録として残しておきたい。\n私はそれを呼んだ。\n\n楽しい時間はもうすぐ終わります。\n\nここには長い壁のような文章がありますが、謝らないでください、TLDRはありません。誰にも期待しないでください。\n誰も読まないと思いますが。\n\n--- すべては国債とインフレにかかっている---。\n\n見ないでください...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"伟大的市场风潮几乎在我们身边出现了","the_new_excerpt":"我不指望这个会超级流行，但我想把它作为一个记录，说\n我叫它。\n\n好日子快到头了。\n\n这里有一堵长长的文字墙，不要为它道歉，没有TLDR。不要指望任何人\n读这个。\n\n---一切都取决于国债和通货膨胀 ---\n\n别看...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"偉大的市場風潮幾乎在我們身邊出現了","the_new_excerpt":"我不指望這個會超級流行，但我想把它作爲一個記錄，說\n我叫它。\n\n好日子快到頭了。\n\n這裏有一堵長長的文字牆，不要爲它道歉，沒有TLDR。不要指望任何人\n讀這個。\n\n---一切都取決於國債和通貨膨脹 ---\n\n別看...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pwrt85","excerpt":"Senior in College looking to put $500 a month into stocks.
