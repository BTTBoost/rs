They are essentially a data hub for dispensaries where people can either place an order for pickup or even delivery in legal areas. Dispensaries pay big money to be featured by WeedMaps. They are the leader for e-commerce &amp; advertising for the whole cannabis sector. </p>\n\n<p>The only hurdle for WeedMaps to jump through is regulations and legalization. Even Alabama is letting people smoke the ganja now.. plus Chuck Shumer (Senate majority leader) said it is a main focus of Congress to pass federal marijuana legalization laws. Seems to just be a matter of time now. WeedMaps is positioned to be one of the biggest beneficiaries from this. </p>\n\n<p>The app has almost 200k reviews and an average 4.9/5 star rating, obviously many people like the service. Essentially the Shopify of cannabis.. SSPK (WeedMaps) is an absolute steal in the 20’s. IMO this will be a “blue chip” cannabis stock along with GRWG in the long run. </p>\n\n<p>If this were an IPO as opposed to a Special acquisition company merger I’d expect it priced at 50+ like we saw with Bumble or Doordash. People will flock to this stock especially once the ticker changes. </p>\n\n<p>Financials🤓</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Revenue forecast to grow at an annualized 40%, EBITDA at an annualized 55% through 2023</li>\n<li>WeedMaps generates 1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume alone</li>\n<li>Stock trades at enterprise value of 5.6x 2022 sales, well below SaaS comps. </li>\n<li>WeedMaps operates a high-margin marketplace services and never “touches the plant”</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lkwo0i/sspk_weedmaps_dd/","title":"SSPK- WeedMaps DD🍃🔥","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-16T15:28:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-16 15:28","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f086a5c4-c909-5738-b7b1-1a810cf481a8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkwo0i/sspk_weedmaps_dd/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lkwo0i/sspk_weedmaps_dd/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"waltertrading","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/waltertrading","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"waltertrading","score":67,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"SSPK- WeedMaps DD🔥","the_new_excerpt":"如果你是一个大麻行家，你知道WeedMaps。它们基本上是\n一个药房的数据中心，人们可以在这里下单取药，也可以在这里下单取药。\n甚至在合法区域内送货。药房花了大钱，以被\nWeedMaps。他们是电子商务和广告的领导者，为...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"SSPK- WeedMaps DD🔥","the_new_excerpt":"如果你是一個大麻行家，你知道WeedMaps。它們基本上是\n一個藥房的數據中心，人們可以在這裏下單取藥，也可以在這裏下單取藥。\n甚至在合法區域內送貨。藥房花了大錢，以被\nWeedMaps。他們是電子商務和廣告的領導者，爲...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-72ac3695-f993-5e29-8691-fdfbd6bbb8e3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkvzj7/someone_help_please/","title":"Someone help please 🤯","date":"February 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"谁来帮帮我吧 🤯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰來幫幫我吧 🤯。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-80cb4e81-c493-53f6-be78-cee0751acefd","excerpt":"Palantir 2020 Results:\n\n * $1.1 billion in revenue for full year 2020, up 47% year-over-year\n * $322 million in revenue for Q4 2020, up 40% year-over-year\n * Expects Q1 2021 revenue growth of 45% year-over-year\n\nQ4 EPS $(0.08) Misses $0.02 Estimate, Sales $322.00M Beat $300.74M…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll2vl1/palantir_reports_revenue_growth_of_47_for_full/","title":"Palantir Reports Revenue Growth of 47% for Full Year 2020, Expects Q1 2021 Revenue Growth of 45%","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 16, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Palantir报告2020年全年收入增长47%，预计2021年第一季度收入增长45%。","the_new_excerpt":"Palantir 2020年业绩。\n\n * 2020年全年收入11亿美元，同比增长47%。\n * 2020年第四季度收入3.22亿美元，同比增长40%。\n *预计2021年第一季度收入将同比增长45%。\n\n第四季度EPS(0.08)元低于预期0.02元，销售额3.22亿元胜过3.074亿元...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Palantir報告2020年全年收入增長47%，預計2021年第一季度收入增長45%。","the_new_excerpt":"Palantir 2020年業績。\n\n * 2020年全年收入11億美元，同比增長47%。\n * 2020年第四季度收入3.22億美元，同比增長40%。\n *預計2021年第一季度收入將同比增長45%。\n\n第四季度EPS(0.08)元低於預期0.02元，銷售額3.22億元勝過3.074億元...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-f086a5c4-c909-5738-b7b1-1a810cf481a8","previousId":"RedditPost-72ac3695-f993-5e29-8691-fdfbd6bbb8e3","nextId":"RedditPost-80cb4e81-c493-53f6-be78-cee0751acefd","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lkwo0i/sspk_weedmaps_dd/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
