I have had good and bad picks that over time it evens out almost to the level of SPY. I actually wanted to take more risk that SPY and that&#39;s why I started buying individual stocks. </p>\n\n<p>In recent months I started moving my portfolio to TQQQ, SPXL, TMF and some ARK ETFs. Because of my age and future income it makes sense for me to take on riskier investments. </p>\n\n<p>Moving to ETFs had a nice impact. I don&#39;t care about news on companies anymore. I don&#39;t care if Tesla sold more cars than NIO or not. I don&#39;t count the days to the earning calls to see how my stock pick will perform. It liberated me to focus on my day job which actually funds my investing portfolio </p>\n\n<p>What your experience with ETFs vs. individual stocks has been?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lbxqgp/etf_and_chill_vs_actively_picking_stocks/","title":"ETF and chill vs. actively picking stocks","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T23:25:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 23:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"73ef8dff-c537-5138-8ea5-b01877239b81","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbxqgp/etf_and_chill_vs_actively_picking_stocks/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbxqgp/etf_and_chill_vs_actively_picking_stocks/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"mehyay76","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/mehyay76","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"mehyay76","score":544,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ETF和寒冬VS主动选股","the_new_excerpt":"我现在是全职工作，在过去的几年里，我了解到自己不是\n善于选股。我有好的和坏的选择，随着时间的推移，它甚至是\n出几乎到了SPY的水平。其实我想承担更多的风险，SPY和\n所以我才开始买入个股。\n\n最近...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ETF和寒冬VS主動選股","the_new_excerpt":"我現在是全職工作，在過去的幾年裏，我瞭解到自己不是\n善於選股。我有好的和壞的選擇，隨着時間的推移，它甚至是\n出幾乎到了SPY的水平。其實我想承擔更多的風險，SPY和\n所以我纔開始買入個股。\n\n最近...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-17038ccd-ee23-51d9-86ff-23a68f52a416","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbwia9/couldnt_possibly_be_hedge_funds/","title":"COULDN’T POSSIBLY BE HEDGE FUNDS 💎👐💎","date":"February 03, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"不可能是对冲基金💎👐💎。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"不可能是對沖基金💎👐💎。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7c0a711b-bd58-561a-af88-e1f980be0fb4","excerpt":"Hi as the title says im new and im trying to learn investing and id need some\nhelp with it.\nThe stock market is completly nuts and i want to put my money were i feel it has\nits place.\n\nBetting purly on the sentiment of social media is too stressful and if i want to\ngamble id go for cryptos or wait…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lbu6ys/with_all_that_chaos_going_on_i_actually_decided/","title":"With all that chaos going on i actually decided to learn about investing - not speculating","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 04, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"随着所有的混乱，我居然决定学习投资 - 不是投机。","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，正如标题所说的IM新的和IM试图学习投资和ID需要一些。\n帮助它。\n股市是完全疯狂的，我想把我的钱，我觉得它已经\n其位置。\n\n在社交媒体的情绪上下注纯粹是压力太大，如果我想要\n赌博，我选择加密货币或等待... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"隨着所有的混亂，我居然決定學習投資 - 不是投機。","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，正如標題所說的IM新的和IM試圖學習投資和ID需要一些。\n幫助它。\n股市是完全瘋狂的，我想把我的錢，我覺得它已經\n其位置。\n\n在社交媒體的情緒上下注純粹是壓力太大，如果我想要\n賭博，我選擇加密貨幣或等待... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-73ef8dff-c537-5138-8ea5-b01877239b81","previousId":"RedditPost-17038ccd-ee23-51d9-86ff-23a68f52a416","nextId":"RedditPost-7c0a711b-bd58-561a-af88-e1f980be0fb4","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lbxqgp/etf_and_chill_vs_actively_picking_stocks/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
