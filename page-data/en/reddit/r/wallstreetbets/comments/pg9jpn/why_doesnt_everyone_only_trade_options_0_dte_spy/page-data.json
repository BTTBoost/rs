WSB has introduced me to the great world of options, and it has completely changed my life. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Pre-WSB</strong>\nI am ashamed to admit… but I used to be a… <em>Boglehead</em>. In my early investing days (~5 months ago) the dinosaur Vanguard lentil eaters told me it is <em>impossible</em> to beat the market. They all accepted an early defeat that they’ll never be rich, so they default to 6% yearly returns and averaging into the occasional 40% crash. Rather than risking my money on something <em>totally risky</em> like Apple (which holds $300B+ in cash and literally only goes up), I should own Apple and 5000 other companies that nobody knows or cares about.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, these boomers convinced me and I threw my entire portfolio into VT and BND. “Own the market and you will get rich…. when you’re 500 years old”. After holding for 2 weeks and losing 1.3%, I sold all my shares and started a new adventure. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Learning from WSB</strong>\nAs I came to WSB, I saw a skilled trader lose $100k in seconds. His life: destroyed. In the next post, I saw another investor make $100k in seconds. His life: changed! I was in awe. The Bogleheads made me lose 1.2% of my account and told me to “hold for the next 60 years”. Meanwhile I saw someone make 10,000% in a few minutes on some SPY calls. So I did what any logical person would do and opened a Robinhood account. I promptly applied for options, and Vlad personally gave me approval. He told me that life in Bulgaria was very difficult, but through options he was able to get out of the poor eurozone and into the United States. </p>\n\n<p>My first trade was a massive success. I made 20% on an SPY call. I made 3 years worth of the Bogleheads dream in minutes. These losers can’t compete. In the subsequent few months, I have 100x my account. Through a series of 0-1 DTE SPY calls, I have found great success trading complex financial derivatives that I do not understand. It’s amazing. My life has been changed and I cannot thank WSB enough. </p>\n\n<p><strong>THANK YOU</strong>\nI would like to thank WSB for fundamentally changing my life. Not only have you made me 100x richer, but you have taught me the importance of risk taking. I would still be a Vanguard boglehead loser if I didn’t discover the power of 0-1DTE SPY calls (I do not buy puts since they’re anti-American 🇺🇸🦅💪). If WSB was not filled with such intellectuals, I would have not trusted the numerous great DDs.</p>\n\n<p>This leads me to my question:\n<strong>Why doesn’t everyone trade options?</strong>\nI don’t think it makes sense to buy and hold something for DECADES and hope for a 100% return after 20 years. I have made 100x in 3 months and could not imagine how pathetic I would look still holding VT and BND. I have leveraged all my accounts through a series of all in trades. I now have a Tesla arriving soon all thanks to the YOLO and WSB. </p>\n\n<p>Why doesn’t everyone do this?! It seems like free money.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/","title":"Why doesn’t everyone only trade options? 0 DTE SPY calls are like free money","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"September 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-02T16:33:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-02 16:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pg9jpn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"SirYoloGod","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/SirYoloGod","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"SirYoloGod","score":1472,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"なぜみんなオプションだけを取引しないのか？0 DTEのSPYコールはフリーマネーのようなもの","the_new_excerpt":"私はWallStreetBetsの偉大な頭脳を熱心に学んできており、幅広い知識を得ています。\n投資、リスク管理、ポートフォリオの成長に関する幅広い知識を得ることができました。WSBは\nオプションの素晴らしい世界を紹介してくれて、私の人生を完全に変えてくれました。\n人生が変わりました。\n\nWSB以前の私は、恥ずかしながら...以前は...... でした。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"为什么不是所有人都只交易期权？0个DTE SPY看涨期权就像是免费的钱","the_new_excerpt":"我一直热衷于学习WallStreetBets的伟大思想，并获得了广泛的投资知识。\n在投资、风险管理和投资组合增长方面的广泛知识。WSB将我引入了伟大的期权世界。\n将我引入了伟大的期权世界，它完全改变了我的\n的生活。\n\n在WSB之前，我很惭愧地承认......但我曾经是一个......。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼不是所有人都只交易期權？0個DTE SPY看漲期權就像是免費的錢","the_new_excerpt":"我一直熱衷於學習WallStreetBets的偉大思想，並獲得了廣泛的投資知識。\n在投資、風險管理和投資組合增長方面的廣泛知識。WSB將我引入了偉大的期權世界。\n將我引入了偉大的期權世界，它完全改變了我的\n的生活。\n\n在WSB之前，我很慚愧地承認......但我曾經是一個......。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pghynq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pghynq/i_just_quit_my_job_so_that_i_could_roll_over_my/","title":"I just quit my job so that I could roll over my 401k into an IRA and put it all in GME!
