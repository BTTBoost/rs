The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.</p>\n\n<p>New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March&#39;s stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. </p>\n\n<p>In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed’s traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic&#39;s grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “An episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won’t affect Federal Reserve policy because they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves.” Moreover, he said “For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.” In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn’t expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.</p>\n\n<p>In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” </p>\n\n<p>Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.</p>\n\n<p>This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:</strong> 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior</li>\n<li><strong>Continuing claims, week ended May 15:</strong> 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“Meme-stocks”, particularly AMC, were absolutely on fire this week, as the battle between wallstreetbets and hedge funds continues. </li>\n<li>President Joe Biden unveiled a budget that would hike federal spending to $6 trillion for the coming fiscal year.</li>\n<li>Boeing (BA) agreed to pay at least $17 million to settle enforcement cases with the Federal Aviation Administration over production issues with its 737 jets.
