Realistically, an ETF should have continued growth over years - mabye 5-10% a year? I’ve been invested in some of the ARK ETFS for 2 months and seen 20% gains already. Is this an effect of this bull market or is Cathie Woods really that great? How light do you guys think this can continue? I’m reluctant to putting a large amount of money into ARK because in 10-20 years time I’m not so sure ARK will be the mammoth it is today - although I’m sure it will still be gaining. Are these ARK ETFs here to stay long term or do you think they will reach the end of their life within 10 years?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lhw8s4/how_long_can_ark_momentum_continue/","title":"How long can ARK momentum continue?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-12T01:38:13.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-12 01:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b6048853-9971-53a1-8446-a0e73e829563","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhw8s4/how_long_can_ark_momentum_continue/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhw8s4/how_long_can_ark_momentum_continue/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"theepicone111","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/theepicone111","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"theepicone111","score":122,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ARK的势头还能持续多久？","the_new_excerpt":"我知道这是一只主动管理的基金，但这些收益是闻所未闻的。\n现实中，ETF应该有持续多年的增长--可能是5-10%的增长。\n年？我投资了一些ARK ETFS 2个月，看到了20%的收益\n已经。这是本轮牛市的效应，还是凯西-伍兹... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"ARK的勢頭還能持續多久？","the_new_excerpt":"我知道這是一隻主動管理的基金，但這些收益是聞所未聞的。\n現實中，ETF應該有持續多年的增長--可能是5-10%的增長。\n年？我投資了一些ARK ETFS 2個月，看到了20%的收益\n已經。這是本輪牛市的效應，還是凱西-伍茲... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-768d6c74-f518-5670-b2b4-f06336f106f5","excerpt":"Hedge funds have just realised that while you all pretend to have diamond hands,\nthe truth is once they smash your stocks with shorts and drive the price down\nyou get worried about your $700 investment and sell.\n\nIt’s the opportunity of a lifetime for these funds that just need to read\nwhatever you…","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhucq5/why_your_meme_stocks_are_getting_murdered_now/","title":"Why your meme stocks are getting murdered now","date":"February 12, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"为什么你的meme股票现在被谋杀了？","the_new_excerpt":"对冲基金才意识到，虽然你们都假装有钻石手。\n事实是，一旦他们用空头砸你的股票，把价格压低了\n你担心你的700美元的投资而卖掉。\n\n这是千载难逢的机会，对于这些基金来说，只需要读懂\n随你","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼你的meme股票現在被謀殺了？","the_new_excerpt":"對沖基金才意識到，雖然你們都假裝有鑽石手。\n事實是，一旦他們用空頭砸你的股票，把價格壓低了\n你擔心你的700美元的投資而賣掉。\n\n這是千載難逢的機會，對於這些基金來說，只需要讀懂\n隨你","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-939eb214-507e-5a2a-b295-0925c08df4b7","excerpt":"They keep calling it the \"Reddit Rebellion\" which is annoying as shit but I keep\nit on in the background at work all day.
