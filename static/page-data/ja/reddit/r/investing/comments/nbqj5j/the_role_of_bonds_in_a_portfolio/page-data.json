During prolonged downturns, you&#39;re rebalancing more into equities which continue to drop further and faster than your bond component. During recoveries, you may be rebalancing away from equity momentum.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if the bond allocation is only better than 100% equities during downturns, and if the long-run has 100% equities outperforming, isn&#39;t trying to have a bond component for the option to rebalance during downturns almost akin to market timing?</p>\n\n<p>Is the only reason for bond allocation at this point volatility dampening effects? if that&#39;s the case should we be looking to cash? or even less correlated assets? or more diversification?</p>\n\n<p>If the drawdowns didn&#39;t affect your ability to afford your life, i.e. no need to draw on even 20% of the portfolio for the next 10 years, should we just be 100% equities? Presuming the stomach allows it?</p>\n\n<p>I know this might have been a roundabout way going at what we already have a rule of thumb responses for. &quot;no need for it if young and high enough risk tolerance&quot; or &quot;(120 - age)% in equities, rest in bonds&quot;, but I&#39;m having a hard time seeing even the slightest benefit to it. I haven&#39;t shown it here, but it&#39;s hard to even create a return/volatility optimal portfolio with it given recent data. Correlations are not as low as they need to be. If you really were a 70-year-old retiree, I would even say bonds don&#39;t have enough of a return premium relative to their risk over cash.</p>\n\n<p>I would post this on <a href=\"/r/changemyview\">/r/changemyview</a> if it weren&#39;t so topic-specific. Why do you / would you include bonds in your portfolio?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: so just to clarify, I’m not making the trivial point that bonds return less than stocks in the long run, or that they reduce volatility to your tolerance level - I’m just asking for the “pros” to owning them. The argument for being able to rebalance was the most compelling one for me (especially because I don’t have an income to dollar cost average), but I’m noting even that benefit isn’t super strong. </p>\n\n<p>I might look into the retiree case. I imagine another variable is ratio of expenses to portfolio. It would be interesting to see survival rates of different allocations on a 2 way axis against different expense/portfolio ratios and duration of living off portfolio. Maybe I’ll sim it out later. </p>\n\n<p>As a side note, despite this post, I do have a fixed income allocation. Granted, it’s levered such that the yield on cash is about 5% (it used to be as high as 12% on investment grade corporates).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/nbqj5j/the_role_of_bonds_in_a_portfolio/","title":"The role of bonds in a portfolio","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"May 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-05-13T22:59:34.000Z","datetime":"2021-05-13 22:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"eacd1e62-36c6-55cb-94ea-370b9e9786d4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nbqj5j/the_role_of_bonds_in_a_portfolio/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nbqj5j/the_role_of_bonds_in_a_portfolio/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"monodactyl","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/monodactyl","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"monodactyl","score":406,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ポートフォリオの中での債券の役割","the_new_excerpt":"またこの話をして申し訳ありません。私は常に、低いリターンにもかかわらず\n債券はバランスのとれたポートフォリオの中で果たすべき役割があると信じてきました。ボラティリティーを抑えるためにも\nボラティリティーを抑え、株式の下落時にリバランスするためのものである。\nレバレッジとの相関性が低いため、リスク調整後のリターンを向上させる。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"债券在投资组合中的作用","the_new_excerpt":"很抱歉再次提出这个问题。我一直认为，尽管债券的回报率低\n回报，债券在平衡的投资组合中还是有作用的。或者是为了抑制\n波动性，在股票下跌时提供一些再平衡的对象。\n改善风险调整后的回报，因为它与杠杆的相关性很低。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"債券在投資組合中的作用","the_new_excerpt":"很抱歉再次提出這個問題。我一直認爲，儘管債券的回報率低\n回報，債券在平衡的投資組合中還是有作用的。或者是爲了抑制\n波動性，在股票下跌時提供一些再平衡的對象。\n改善風險調整後的回報，因爲它與槓桿的相關性很低。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ca5e905e-0c23-52bc-b5be-c6a0d7788279","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbnc2e/wsb_right_now/","title":"WSB right now!!","date":"May 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今すぐWSB!!!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"现在是WSB！!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在是WSB！!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c2d26c40-2ead-56f5-9a0c-baddacf9828f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbnumh/ground_control_to_major_tom/","title":"Ground Control to Major Tom 🚀","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"May 13, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"グランド・コントロールからメジャー・トム🚀へ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"地面控制中心呼叫汤姆少校 🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"地面控制中心呼叫湯姆少校 🚀","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-eacd1e62-36c6-55cb-94ea-370b9e9786d4","previousId":"RedditPost-ca5e905e-0c23-52bc-b5be-c6a0d7788279","nextId":"RedditPost-c2d26c40-2ead-56f5-9a0c-baddacf9828f","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/nbqj5j/the_role_of_bonds_in_a_portfolio/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
