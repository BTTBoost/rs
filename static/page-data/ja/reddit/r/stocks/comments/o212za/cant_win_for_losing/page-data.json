A couple of months ago, I was getting killed in tech, so I started moving out of tech and into ETFs -  industrials, materials, the defense sector, oil and gold miners as hedges against inflation, and a bet on reopening. Yesterday, the market got all worried about inflation and tapering, and today (and for the last few days, really) all of those sectors are getting destroyed. And guess what is all in the green? Tech. Even the ARK stocks. The very things that are supposed to sell off with higher inflation and higher interest rates. I have an airline stock - Spirit Airlines - that has been getting upgrade after upgrade into the mid $40s and low $50s, but has been sinking like a stone for 2 months now, and is now at $33. They said it was because oil was going up. But today oil&#39;s down, and airlines are still taking it on the chin - hard.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I&#39;m just venting... But it doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. No wonder people just throw their money into AMC and GME these days.
