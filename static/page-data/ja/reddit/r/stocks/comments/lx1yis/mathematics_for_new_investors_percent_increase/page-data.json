If a stock increases by 50% one day, and then decreases by 50% the next day, how much do you have? Hint, you lost money. We’ve all heard this before but it’s coming up a lot recently. </p>\n\n<p>The thing about this, mathematically, is that the bigger the % change, the more it actually matters. I.e., if you’re talking about a stock that goes up 1% one day and then down 1% the next day, you’ve actually only lost 0.01% of value. However, in the example above at 50% volatility, you’ve lost 25% of the value ($100 stock goes to $150 then down to $75). At the extreme at 99% up then 99% down, you’re stock is now worth $1.99.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a graph I made to show what the curve looks like at different % change levels: (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/dyb1npq\">https://imgur.com/gallery/dyb1npq</a>)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lx1yis/mathematics_for_new_investors_percent_increase/","title":"MATHEMATICS FOR NEW INVESTORS: Percent increase ≠ Percent decrease","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"March 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-03T21:16:59.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-03 21:16","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"2da9d912-e4f0-57a5-ac71-3f4c54c9f9df","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lx1yis/mathematics_for_new_investors_percent_increase/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lx1yis/mathematics_for_new_investors_percent_increase/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"bob_ross_lives","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bob_ross_lives","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"bob_ross_lives","score":177,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"新投资者的数学。增加百分比 ≠ 减少百分比","the_new_excerpt":"在一个波动的市场中，这一点很重要。如果一只股票在某一天上涨了50%，并且\n第二天又减少了50%，你有多少钱？提示，你赔钱了。\n我们都听说过这个，但最近经常出现。\n\n这个事情，从数学上来说，就是百分比变化越大，... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新投資者的數學。增加百分比 ≠ 減少百分比","the_new_excerpt":"在一個波動的市場中，這一點很重要。如果一隻股票在某一天上漲了50%，並且\n第二天又減少了50%，你有多少錢？提示，你賠錢了。\n我們都聽說過這個，但最近經常出現。\n\n這個事情，從數學上來說，就是百分比變化越大，... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-87c2a814-3f08-5ff5-8087-f7fc4dc559a2","excerpt":"What is something that’s causing you to hold it or making you to think about\nbuying even more?
