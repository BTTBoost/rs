&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jack Dorsey’s payments giant said in an announcement the new name, effective Dec. 10, “acknowledges the company’s growth” and “creates room for further growth.” Block will still trade under the ticker SQ on the Nasdaq.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs,” Jack Dorsey, cofounder and CEO of Block, said in a statement. “Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dorsey co-founded Square in 2009 with a focus on in-person payments and its namesake card reader, which let people accept credit card payments on a smartphone. San Francisco-based Square has since added a peer-to-peer digital banking app, small business lending, received a bank charter and offers crypto and stock trading. The company has acquired buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay and Jay-Z’s music streaming service Tidal. It’s also doubling down on bitcoin with a crypto-focused business called TBD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As part of the Square rebrand, a separate part of the company “dedicated to advancing Bitcoin,” known as Square Crypto, will change its name to Spiral.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“The name has many associated meanings for the company — building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome,” Block said in a statement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dorsey stepped down from his other job as Twitter CEO on Monday after running both Twitter and Square since 2015. Dorsey cited a belief Twitter was “ready to move on from its founders,” and will now have more time to dedicate to Square’s growing portfolio. But Dorsey is also expected to focus on his fascination with cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The news comes roughly a month after Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect on CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to build a virtual world called the metaverse. Google famously renamed itself Alphabet six years ago in a similar move to reflect other lines of business.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Square was one of the biggest winners of 2020 as consumers shifted to digital payments. Shares are down roughly 2% so far this year, as investors rotate away from higher-growth tech names.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However now, after its earnings in early November, the company has been dropping like a stone and is 23% down since then (and 6% just today!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The earnings were mostly good, with huge growth but higher loss per share than anticipated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The company is favoured by analysts with a &amp;amp;quot;Buy&amp;amp;quot; rating and average price target of 400$, it has good press (often mentioned as a stock to buy with a high potential), it has multiple sources of revenue (e-commerce, e-sports, payments) yet it keeps dropping and dropping for a month now, now at a level last time seen around June.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At first i thought that some red might come from associating it with chinese stocks (even though the company is from Singapore) but not a nearly 25% drop...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is there something I&amp;amp;#39;m not seeing here?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been investing 15% of my income into my 401(k) for the last 3.5 years. It is at $80,000. It is through Fidelity and invested in a Vanguard TRF. My company matches $0.50 up to 6%. I have never maxed out my contributions but my yearly 6-7% profit sharing bonus helps me exceed the number (I know it doesn’t count against the limit).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just started a Roth IRA with Vanguard. All of it is in VTSAX. I will max that out each year moving forward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Am I doing this right? Should I go back and max out the 401k? Should I put all additional income towards the car? Should I open a taxable brokerage account and build that up as well in case I need to use that money?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is my setup:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enter (3min bars)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I took 11 stocks from yahoo article named &amp;amp;quot;11 Best Covid Vaccine Stocks&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Each day I was waiting for 1% (or more) dip between 9:30am and 11:00am&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I was buying a stock if there is a single green candle after the dip&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If there are multiple stocks I was buying the one with the largest dip&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Max 2 trades per day&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exit (1min bars)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exit when stock recovered 1%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Each position had 0.25% trailing stop loss&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Always exit by the EOD&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Initial capital $10,000&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The surge in new customers this year, fueled in part by free phone offers and slightly higher consumer spending, will probably cool off next year, McElfresh said at the event hosted by Wells Fargo &amp;amp;amp; Co. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“There’s no doubt that the stimulus programs have put some extra cash into household budgets,” McElfresh said. “And so we’re not expecting that level of activity to continue into 2022 and beyond.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The executive, who leads the company’s wireless phone unit, added that AT&amp;amp;amp;T would take “more than our fair share” of growth in the business over the next two to three years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AT&amp;amp;amp;T shares were trading down 5.3% to $22.63 at 1:01 p.m. in New York. The comments also sent mobile peers Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. down about 2% and 4%, respectively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

我决定做一些基本的研究。
<p>我发现的其中一件事是这样的。<a
href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical...]]></description><link>https://stocks.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r5xmuy/about_the_fed_increasing_rates/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://stocks.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r5xmuy/about_the_fed_increasing_rates/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 21:27:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&amp;lt;!-- SC_OFF --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So this seems to be the topic for today and I&amp;amp;#39;m rather uneducated about it I decided to do some basic research.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the things I found was this: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was looking for a co-relation between the stock market and rates, but basically even when rates were not 0 and increasing (2016-2019) the market rallied anyways... well, not exactly, trade wars with China in 2018 caused quite a dip but that recovered in like 6 months and then kept on rallying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My question is: why is everyone going crazy about how if they increase rates now everything is gonna crash? Historically speaking rates have never been increased in a ridiculous manner, as in they increase in either a slow and steady manner or in a &amp;amp;quot;ladder&amp;amp;quot; graph manner (see 2004 and 2015 onwards). The dotcom bubble happened while rates were over 5%, same with the 2008 one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Based on the last 20~ years we can expect rates to take at least 2 years to go back up to a &amp;amp;quot;decent&amp;amp;quot; point (2~3%). What this means is that unless a first-time-ever event happens the FED is probably gonna increase their rates next year starting in either spring or summer and at the end of 2022 they&amp;amp;#39;re probably still gonna be sub 1%... which means we&amp;amp;#39;re talking about a 2~4 year progress until rates stop climbing and stabilize.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This makes me wonder: why is everyone talking as if the FED starting to increase rates is the apocalypse for the market? What am I missing? Is everyone just absolutely ignorant or am I the one who&amp;amp;#39;s missing some other factors? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand there&amp;amp;#39;s the whole debt to pay your debts, rollovers, whatever you want to call these things, as in highest interest rates = more expensive to finance growth, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see how very slight increases are that much of a problem, it&amp;amp;#39;s still very cheap money and even though it might slow growth I don&amp;amp;#39;t see how it will stop it and make everything crash. Sure, the market will slow down a bit, growth stocks might stop skyrocketing 40~100% every year, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see how they would stop growing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11&quot;&amp;gt;Business Insider&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11&quot;&amp;gt;Bank of America&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This Will Not Last - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/&quot;&amp;gt;Nick Maggiulli&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adding to all of this, we can see that the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/095t1dtniq281.png?width=899&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7db181ad101f44183162eae205bcdb5fb857e01f&quot;&amp;gt;Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back [1].&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what I wanted to analyze is: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! [2]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Warning Signs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 crossed 40, which is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the highest reading in the last two decades&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fzax1ecriq281.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b59bc4f2bfde765ffab5deb3376ddae53b5fe4c3&quot;&amp;gt;1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Increasing use of leverage&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/&quot;&amp;gt;This survey conducted by Magnifymoney&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. [3]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kkx1cfjtiq281.png?width=854&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b8af5f2398c5273fc770ba1f6a265ad3ffcf1a7b&quot;&amp;gt;Research by Goldman Sachs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;the entire market used to do in 2019&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Rise of new issues and speculative assets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo&quot;&amp;gt;the Rivian IPO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SPACs [4] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/&quot;&amp;gt;large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypto where &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:%7E:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&amp;amp;amp;text=It&amp;amp;#x27;s%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.&quot;&amp;gt;NFTs are being sold&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Investor expectations&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More than the P/E ratio, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;i&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qnfuyiqwiq281.png?width=1125&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fb279b8dae3bd9803be4b8f7bf26c1984f7a87b8&quot;&amp;gt;nvestor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company&amp;amp;#39;s sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you consider a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/&quot;&amp;gt;four-year time period&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Are we certain it’s a bubble?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Low-interest rates&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x1408niziq281.png?width=700&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ee123520c9b2ea0d2f9b10b59d6b2fd181fac446&quot;&amp;gt;historically low 0.25% that we have now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New Investors&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lpojhko0jq281.png?width=935&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1ede81940da2355edc282ba1feca54bad415c4b0&quot;&amp;gt;But the data they put out during their IPO filing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;401(k) and Index funds&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I have highlighted in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/&quot;&amp;gt;one of my previous article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/&quot;&amp;gt;more than 50% of the fund market&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. According to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html&quot;&amp;gt;this report&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market [5].&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What’s the implication?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But, that’s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The expected annual return by investors &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/b4vspq13jq281.png?width=928&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=aa81e2478da9eb80ba1b001e0a2c6b29d9313b97&quot;&amp;gt;above inflation is a whopping 17.5%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;(which is 161% more than what is realistic) — This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915&quot;&amp;gt;this thread from Corry Wang&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‘98), &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;making money using that information was hard!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/&quot;&amp;gt;crash from as far back as 2017&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As Peter Lynch quoted,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Until next week…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe that the best industries to invest in for the long run are media and tech due to the low cost of replicating their product for any number of consumers once a given piece of media or code is produced. For that reason, I have closely watched Disney for some time. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disney stock is down 18.45% YTD. I have been buying some of the dip on this stock recently, but as I have been doing more of my own DD on DIS, I&amp;amp;#39;ve become increasingly hesitant to expand my position. I&amp;amp;#39;m going to keep a small position because I believe so strongly in the Disney ecosystem of universes and stories that largely define our culture: Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Disney classics like Beauty and the Beast, etc., but overall I remain relatively bearish on this company. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe that the management of Disney is weak, and has a track record of questionable acquisitions and weak implementation. Bob Chapek, the CEO, is a robot at best. He sounds dead inside. He has no flair or personality. he should be running a Lowe&amp;amp;#39;s or Target, not a media empire where cultural relevance and nimble action are key to creating viral hits. In interviews and earnings calls, he is generally vague and even sounds somewhat uninformed. He rarely has any data at hand and instead vaguely talks about potential opportunities. If he isn&amp;amp;#39;t data-driven and isn&amp;amp;#39;t inspiring, it&amp;amp;#39;s hard to see him as a strong leader. Listen to the latest earnings call; he failed to adequately answer pretty much any of the analysts&amp;amp;#39; questions. Every question he is asked, Bob replies with some meaningless statements like wanting the consumer to decide or vaguely referring to the metaverse, or wanting to expand into sports betting. This is a problem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The direction that the management is taking the company seems unfocused. Disney should double down on Disney+ direct-to-consumer streaming and dollar-for-dollar blow Netflix&amp;amp;#39;s content production investments out of the water. Right now, Netflix is projected to spend $13.6B on new content in 2021, and Disney is projected to spend $33B, but much of Disney&amp;amp;#39;s content spend is going towards cable/sports/Hulu rather than doubling down and competing with Netflix via Disney+. Disney needs to focus on becoming the future children&amp;amp;#39;s stories, family adventures, myths, the metaverse, etc. of the emerging global culture and getting every household on a monthly subscription. They haven&amp;amp;#39;t had any new high-quality content since the Mandalorian (and potentially 1 or 2 of the marvel shows). This is why they only added 2 million new subscribers last quarter whereas Netflix added 4.4 million. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead, Disney is messing around with ESPN+ and Hulu and considering dabbling in gambling. Hulu is trash and should be sold immediately. the content isn&amp;amp;#39;t cohesive with Disney&amp;amp;#39;s brand, so it can&amp;amp;#39;t be bundled directly into Disney+, so they should sell it and use that revenue to create more family-friendly video content, family games, video games, and books to build out their ecosystem. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past 18 months, Netflix has put out many major hits including Squid Game, The Queen&amp;amp;#39;s Gambit, Ozark season 3, etc. Simply put, Netflix is outcompeting Disney right now. Every subscriber that Netflix adds is taking market share from competitors. Disney is struggling with product cannibalization as it tries to switch to a DTC model and is failing to produce top-notch content. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The latest Star Wars trilogy was botched from the top down. It was not the actors&amp;amp;#39; or screenwriters&amp;amp;#39; fault. It was management failing to communicate between directors to create a cohesive story (you can read more about this independently). I know much of this occurred before Bob Chapek, but I think this shows that the broader management team across Disney is weak. Miscommunication on this scale is appalling. A truly passionate management would have paid careful attention to make the relaunch of Star Wars a lot less bumpy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;ESPN+ should be spun off and sold immediately. It&amp;amp;#39;s great, but sports has never been what Disney is about, and another company could probably get more focused on making it a more profitable business model. I know betting is becoming more accepted, and I have nothing against it, but it definitely hurts Disney&amp;amp;#39;s brand to be moving towards getting involved with sports betting. This overall just does not align with Disney&amp;amp;#39;s vision. Disney is about the mouse, not the casino. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disney is so hesitant to move away from the old economy of cable and theaters, and this prevents them from dropping the freshest content directly on Disney+, which lowers the value of the subscription for consumers. I&amp;amp;#39;m worried that this business is a bit of a dinosaur competing against nimble tech giants like Amazon, Apple, and Netflix all getting involved in streaming. This Halloween, kids were dressed up as characters from Netflix shows a lot more so than from Disney brands. Overall, I am worried that Disney&amp;amp;#39;s management choices over the past few years reflect that of AT&amp;amp;amp;T&amp;amp;#39;s over the past decade. Poor acquisitions, poor implementation of strategies, and terrible returns for investors. The only thing propping up Disney right now is how timeless their legacy brand is, which gives them a moat that AT&amp;amp;amp;Tnever had. This moat buys Disney time to get its act together, but that time may be running out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t own any Disney, I would say it&amp;amp;#39;s a decent company to open a small position in, but for those of you heavily invested already, I think this is something to consider before you double down too heavily on these dips. As far as valuation, Disney&amp;amp;#39;s P/E looks high right now at 130, but once the parks and theaters get back to running full cylinders, I estimate their P/E will quickly come down below 50 if current trends hold.  I know that P/E is a limited metric, but by whatever metric you look at, after the most recent dip, there is a strong argument that this is a relatively fair price point to buy in at. That said, I&amp;amp;#39;m not convinced this is a particularly strong opportunity, and I like alternatives that are producing media like NFLX and AAPL better. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disclosure: I own shares of both Disney and Netflix. I am weighted more heavily towards Netflix, and I am just a guy on the internet so don&amp;amp;#39;t take my advice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, it works like this. Do you think you&amp;amp;#39;ll be alive when you&amp;amp;#39;re 60 years old? (Yes?/No?). If you think you&amp;amp;#39;ll be alive, do you think you&amp;amp;#39;d like to be able to withdraw money and profits $$$ from a Roth IRA that&amp;amp;#39;s completely dodged Uncle Sam&amp;amp;#39;s greedy tax collecting arms? (Yes?/No?)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If both answers are yes, you should have a Roth IRA. PERIOD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I don&amp;amp;#39;t care if you&amp;amp;#39;re 21 years old, 35 years old, or 58 years old. You should probably have a Roth IRA. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, the big question of course is.... &amp;amp;quot;What are the big downsides to having a Roth IRA?&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The biggest downside, is that you&amp;amp;#39;re unable to withdraw any &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;profits&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; without incurring a tax penalty, until you&amp;amp;#39;re 59 1/2 years old. Key word here is profits. It&amp;amp;#39;s a myth that you can&amp;amp;#39;t withdraw anything from a Roth IRA. Once you&amp;amp;#39;ve owned the Roth IRA a certain number of years, you&amp;amp;#39;re allowed to withdraw your contributions. You just can&amp;amp;#39;t also withdraw the winnings. They have to stay in the account until you&amp;amp;#39;re 59 1/2.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What if I have an emergency and need the money?  You can get your money out, but you&amp;amp;#39;ll just have to pay taxes on it, and there might be some other penalties associated with it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How much money do I need to have a Roth IRA? I&amp;amp;#39;m pretty sure you can open one up with a very small amount of money. However, there is something that you&amp;amp;#39;ll need to be aware of. You can only contribute a certain amount of money per year. So you couldn&amp;amp;#39;t open a Roth IRA right now with 50k. If you have a 50k in your bank, that you&amp;amp;#39;d like to put in a Roth IRA, you&amp;amp;#39;re out of luck. Instead, you have to start making yearly contributions. That&amp;amp;#39;s why it&amp;amp;#39;s important to start this process earlier rather than later. I believe you&amp;amp;#39;re limited to a maximum of 6k contribution per year, unless you&amp;amp;#39;re 50 years or older. At the age of 50, you&amp;amp;#39;re able to contribute 7k per year.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think the biggest struggle for people with Roth IRA&amp;amp;#39;s is that people think that they&amp;amp;#39;re putting their money away into a prison, and that money is going to be locked up until they&amp;amp;#39;re old and brittle and can&amp;amp;#39;t enjoy it any damn way. I was talking to my 18 year old son about a Roth IRA, and he just doesn&amp;amp;#39;t want to hear anything about it. For him, it&amp;amp;#39;s 41 years into the future before you can withdraw anything.... but THIS ISN&amp;amp;#39;T TRUE.  You can&amp;amp;#39;t withdraw profits. But at a certain point, you can withdraw contributions if you really got desperate. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The way that I like to explain a Roth IRA to somebody, is to consider a bucket of water. Imagine that the Roth IRA is water at the very bottom of the bucket. You&amp;amp;#39;re mostly using the water at the top of the bucket, to occasionally scoop out a cup of water. The water at the bottom of the bucket just remains there, and it&amp;amp;#39;s still a part of the whole equation, but it&amp;amp;#39;s not being used. It&amp;amp;#39;s probably just going to stay at the very bottom of the bucket. That&amp;amp;#39;s your Roth IRA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, if you&amp;amp;#39;re 35 years old right now, and somehow you got an inheritance of 100k, and you don&amp;amp;#39;t have a Roth IRA yet, you&amp;amp;#39;d be foolish not to take 6k from that 100k and open up a Roth IRA. Take another 6k, and put it into the same Roth IRA in early January. So, you can contribute 12k of that 100k into a Roth IRA in the next 40 days. 6k for 2021 and 6k for 2022.  Now, you as a 35 year old, might be thinking.... &amp;amp;quot;But I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to mess with that 100k. I don&amp;amp;#39;t want to remove 12k of it for some dumb Roth IRA that I&amp;amp;#39;m not going to use for 30 something years&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But remember the water at the bottom of the bucket. Your 100k is still intact. It&amp;amp;#39;s still being 100 percent invested. It&amp;amp;#39;s just the 12k that went into your Roth IRA is at the very bottom of the bucket. Are you planning on spending ever last penny of your stock investing portfolio? No? You&amp;amp;#39;re always going to have some money in your stock market portfolio? Ok, then just consider this 12k that went into your Roth the very bottom of the bucket. Because in 24 1/2 years, you&amp;amp;#39;re going to thank your lucky stars that you did this. Also, come January 2023, you want to throw another 6k in that puppy. You can daytrade and swing trade and do any crazy things you want to do with it inside the Roth IRA, because it never creates any taxable events!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Also, if you get super desperate, cause you lost your job, and you need money bad... You can at least withdraw your contributions with zero penalties (after a certain time period). So you can&amp;amp;#39;t really lose. Just do it. Even if you can only contribute 1k per year... DO IT.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NOTE: Your Annual Income needs to be under 140k per year to contribute to a Roth IRA for that year.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I found this community randomly and been reading up everything for the last days. Loving the tone and the attitude here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was very lucky to work for two big companies and get large RSUs grants before the stock went completely crazy. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I now have ~500k in those two companies stocks, plus another 200k to vest in my current one
Before finding this community I never really questioned my luck (and it is insane), but I think time has come to split the eggs across a lot of small baskets, as the potential downside is so high. 
I also invested in green ETFs with the money I was saving &amp;amp;quot;normally&amp;amp;quot; and did well there. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My question (and I know it is recurrent across this sub) is how to do it time wise.  Should I just dump it across some large indexes at once, or do it more progressively? I understand about time in the market and timing the market, but of course we are almost looking at ATHs across the board and this is a fairly significant sum. I ran a few models based on past data. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also have a good salary and I normally invest 4-5k per month, I am 35 and will not have kids. My only goal is to have a comfortable retirement  around 50.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks so much!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately, after a brief bounce in the market yesterday, volatility resumed as market participants continue to contemplate the potential impact of the new coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant and new comments by newly re-elected Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Since the new variant was discovered last week, the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) erased all its November gains and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed its worst month since April 2020, down more than 4%. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Some Notable Numbers Today&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.87%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dow Jones (DIA) -1.77%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;SPY Bank ETF: -2.24%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;VIX: +15.51%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;AAPL: +3.24%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Powell said, ““We tend to use [the word transitory] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Originally, Central Bank officials hoped inflation would begin moderating in the second-half of 2021, something that has not happened. Instead, prices rose 6.2% in October, the fastest annual rise in the Consumer Price Index since 1990. The Personal Consumption Expenditures, which serve as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation came in 5% higher. Powell said the “risk of higher inflation has increased,” but reiterated that his baseline expectation is for inflation to fall closer to the central bank’s 2% target over the course of 2022.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adding salt to the wound, vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He said, “There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level we had with [the] Delta [variant]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Vivek Paul, BlackRock Investment Institution Chief Investment Strategist said, “Information is coming rapidly, it&amp;amp;#39;s evolving in real-time. You can understand why investors [last week] were taking a little bit of a pause, particularly given the liquidity situation we had going into the U.S. holiday season. We think on balance, it would make sense to be invested in the markets at this moment in time. It&amp;amp;#39;s all about understanding whether or not this is a delay, or a derailment, of the restart that we&amp;amp;#39;ve seen. And it seems most likely at this moment — notwithstanding more information to come— that it looks like a delay.” I agree, it’s important to acknowledge risks present in the markets but it is not time to panic yet, we simply do not have enough information yet. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Highlights&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Amazon (AMZN) introduced two new custom designed computer chips aimed at competing with data center chips from Intel (INTC), NVIDIA (NVDA), and AMD. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) unveils new Amazon-backed cloud trading service for Wall Street firms. The bank is opening up access to its trove of market data and software tools to hedge funds and asset managers in an offering designed with Amazon’s cloud division.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The Omicron variant took crude oil firmly into bear market territory, with WTI crude futures falling to $67 a barrel, a -19.46% decline since recent highs earlier in the month. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Consumer Confidence dropped to 109.5 in November, missing estimates of 110.9 and a marked drop from 113.8 in October, according to a closely watched report by the Conference Board. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Jack Dorsey announced he will be stepping down as CEO of social media Twitter (TWTR), giving the lead role to Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal. In my opinion, this is good news for Twitter, given they will now have more focused leadership. Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Square (SQ) has a lot on his plate.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Meta Platforms (FB) was told to sell animated message company Giphy by UK regulators, citing potential anti-competition concerns. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;According to a survey of 1000 auto industry executives, KPMG found that execs expect electric vehicles will make up roughly 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Stock of Alibaba (BABA) continues its death spiral, reaching its lowest level in over four years, with the stock down more than 60% from its previous all-time high amid an intense regulatory crackdown by the CCP. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tesla (TSLA) announced its latest software update allows in-car purchases and subscriptions for vehicle owners. &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;ConocoPhillips (COP) target raised by Mizuho from $99 to $101 at Buy. Stock currently around $70&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Costco (COST) target raised by Tesley Advisory from $540 to $600 at Outperform. Stock currently around $540&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Hess (HESS) target raised by Mizuho from $130 to $132 at Buy. Stock currently around $75&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Marvell Technology (MRVL) target raised by BMO Capital Markets from $70 to $85 at Outperform. Stock currently around $71&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Realty Income (O) target raised by Mizuho from $81 to $82 at Buy. Stock currently around $68&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So Intel seems to be one of those tech underdogs who no one thinks will perform well in the future because they haven&amp;amp;#39;t been innovative at all in the past few years compared to companies like AMD and such. To me, this looks like a long-term buy opportunity:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Financials look pretty healthy from what I know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2.80% dividend yield is a big nice-to-have if you&amp;amp;#39;re gonna hold the stock patiently for a few years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;P/E ratio is one of the lowest in the tech market right now, meaning that the company has a lot of room to grow if the expectations become optimistic. And in the case of a market crash, it would be one of the safest bets in the tech market because of its healthy P/E ratio (correct me if I&amp;amp;#39;m wrong on this one).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They announced an increase in capital spending for the next year, so they are likely trying to get back the ground that they&amp;amp;#39;ve lost in their technological advancement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They&amp;amp;#39;re soon going to compete in the discrete GPU market too, so that can&amp;amp;#39;t do them any wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With their own semiconductor foundries, they have an upper edge in manufacturing costs and can avoid a lot of supply chain related issues. And with the never-ending chip shortage, they might be able to make more chips at more affordable costs than AMD and Nvidia, who are bound in their production by TSMC&amp;amp;#39;s production capacity. Surely, their manufacturing processes are not as good as TSMC and Samsung&amp;amp;#39;s 5-7 nm processes, but it looks like they plan on catching up with them within the next few years. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They still have their place in the lower-end desktop/mobile CPU market, as their lower-end CPU&amp;amp;#39;s are much cheaper than AMD&amp;amp;#39;s. They offer the cheapest CPU&amp;amp;#39;s with integrated graphics on the market right now. Even if they don&amp;amp;#39;t grow anytime soon, I doubt they will run out of revenue sources, especially with the chip shortage going on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My plan would be to hold the stock for a few years and cash in those nice dividends while waiting for the stock to become a growth one. I think Intel has already reached its floor price, and it would be very unlikely that the stock price goes any lower considering that it has strong fundamentals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What do you think?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That´s my first analysis for NVDA. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today we will look through the basics of NVIDIA´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for NVDA´s stock using discounted free cashflow.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not financial advice and I do not own shares in NVIDIA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;45%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; of their sales comes from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Gaming&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. The &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Data Center&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; makes up around &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;41%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Another &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; comes from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Professional Visualization&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Then there is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;OEM&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and another &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;2%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; from &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Automotive&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the valuation:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We take &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;analyst estimates&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, we discount that by our &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;required return of 9,2%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Then we use the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;perpetual growth rate of 2,5%&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and that gave us a fair value for NVDA´s stock of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$327 per share&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. But because we have to account for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NVDA´s equity&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; as well, our &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;fair value of equity&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; would be &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$311 per share&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With NVDA´s price being at &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$326&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;per share&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; right now, it´s kind of fairly valued. That´s why I think buying &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;heavily&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Where I see NVDA´s stock price in 5 years.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Estimated Growth Rate&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; and the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Future P/E Value&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. With this method I get a stock price of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;$868 per share&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; which is definitely higher than what it is now. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What I´ll do.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; I believe NVIDIA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not exactly where I would want it to be (I want to include a margin of safety), I will maybe start to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;dollar-cost-average&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. That way I won´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/cramer-says-hes-not-ready-to-sell-nvidia-sees-stock-at-10-trillion-one-day.html&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/cramer-says-hes-not-ready-to-sell-nvidia-sees-stock-at-10-trillion-one-day.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cramer told “Fast Money Halftime Report” he believes that Nvidia could be a $10 trillion stock one day. Shares soared 145% year-to-date to an over $800 billion stock market value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s no secret that Cramer loves Nvidia, the largest maker of graphics and artificial intelligence chips in the world. He’s even named his dog Nvidia. On television and in his investing club, the “Mad Money” host has praised CEO Jensen Huang’s vision for how the metaverse — or omniverse, which is Nvidia’s preferred term — can be used by businesses to reduce wastefulness and increase efficiency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
