After doing the math, I&#39;ve realize how wrong I was! In short, if you can save a couple hundred dollars per month, an HSA is possibly your best investment vehicle (after an employer-matched 401K). Here are the calculations to consider...</p>\n\n<h1>1 - Determine your tax savings. Find your tax bracket at <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets\">https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets</a> HSA contributions are pre-tax, so reduce your taxable income. I&#39;m in the 22% bracket, so my tax saving is 22% on contributions. My state tax saving is an additional 5% (yours will vary based on state). Let&#39;s say I can contribute $300/month or $3600 year. My 27% tax savings would be $972/year.</h1>\n\n<h1>2 - Determine your insurance premium savings. You&#39;ll need to consult your employer or health insurance provider. I work for a state education institution. My current family &quot;wellness&quot; plan is $174/month and the HDHP plan is $46/month - so a savings of $128/month or $1536/year.</h1>\n\n<h1>3 - Consider how much MORE you might pay in health care expenses with the HDHP. This is the part that always scared me away, but it turns out it&#39;s nearly impossible to pay more than I would save.</h1>\n\n<p>If I have $0 in health care costs, switching to a HDHP and putting $300/month in an HSA would save me $2508/year ($972 tax savings + $1536 premiums savings).</p>\n\n<p>My current plan has a $1500/family deductible (then 30%), whereas the HDHP has a $3000/family deductible (then 20%). If I had $3000 in expenses (doctor visits and one minor surgery or a couple ER visits per year, etc. - fairly typical for me), the savings would be around $1508/year ($2508 savings - ~$1000 difference in expenses).</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say things go REALLY bad - like a serious accident, cancer, etc. My current plan max is $8000 and the HDHP max is $10000. In this worst-case scenario I still save $508 ($2508-$2000 max difference).</p>\n\n<p>The only way I could lose money on an HSA is to contribute &lt;$140/month AND hit my $10K max out-of-pocket every year.</p>\n\n<p>So, $140+/month in an HSA is already a no-lose scenario for me, but that doesn&#39;t consider the additional value of the tax-free HSA gains over time. This is best realized by never using HSA funds to pay medical expenses (unless you have to or until you want to). $300/month at a 7% annual return for 20 years returns $156,278 on $72,000 in contributions. Maxing out at $600/month returns $312,556 on $86,400 in contributions. THESE GAINS ARE 100% TAX FREE! You never pay taxes on HSA contributions, gains, or withdrawals (thus the triple-tax advantage)!</p>\n\n<p>Now, the HSA funds must be spent on health care expenses (or pay a 20% penalty). A couple can expect $300K+ in retirement health expenses. However, you can reimburse yourself for expenses incurred any time while on the plan - save your receipts for 20 years and then pay yourself. After age 65, you can apply them to long-term care expenses. Or you can use them on whatever you want by simply paying taxes on the withdrawals - making the HSA no different than a Traditional IRA.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything I&#39;m overlooking? Is the HSA really a no-brainer?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/p1uuog/i_did_the_hsa_math_this_is_a_nobrainer/","title":"I did the HSA math.
