My understanding is that this is down to the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Other small oil companies are down about 20-40% of where they were 12 months ago. </p>\n\n<p>OPEC are meeting next month and are likely to maintain production output at its current level, according to the Iraqi Oil Minister a few days ago, possibly into April before they reassess it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m just looking at Oil as a very long term play... </p>\n\n<p>Surely in 12-18 (maybe 24) months time, you&#39;d expect at least a 20 or 30% recovery when the Pandemic starts to subside.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate all the sentiment about Green Energy at the moment, but we need to accept that we&#39;re not all going to be driving Tesla and Nio vehicles anytime before 2025. Its another 9 years (minimum) before petrol cars are banned in most Euro countries. </p>\n\n<p>Airlines, cruise ships, big industry... It&#39;s all going to pick up one day and they all need the black gold to function. I see demand increasing, dollar per barrel increasing, thus stonks go up.</p>\n\n<p>is there any reason I shouldnt be investing very long in oil? And are there any oil tickers anyone could recommend aside from the obvious bp, shell, chevron, exxon etc.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lj1kth/lets_talk_about_very_long_oil_plays/","title":"Let's talk about (very) long Oil plays.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T18:50:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 18:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"51d2b272-f573-5ce9-8825-89da09d446ee","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lj1kth/lets_talk_about_very_long_oil_plays/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lj1kth/lets_talk_about_very_long_oil_plays/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"electricp0ww0w","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/electricp0ww0w","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"electricp0ww0w","score":84,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"让我们来谈谈(非常)长的石油剧。","the_new_excerpt":"我在凌晨5点看了一些彭博社，因为我无法入睡，并注意到。\n石油这几天真的起飞了，可能和标普一致。\n\n总之，我看了一下几乎大部分的大石油公司，BP，壳牌\n等，它们都在12个月前的50%左右徘徊... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"讓我們來談談(非常)長的石油劇。","the_new_excerpt":"我在凌晨5點看了一些彭博社，因爲我無法入睡，並注意到。\n石油這幾天真的起飛了，可能和標普一致。\n\n總之，我看了一下幾乎大部分的大石油公司，BP，殼牌\n等，它們都在12個月前的50%左右徘徊... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-031c1def-217d-5a93-aff7-7e7213c1fa1b","excerpt":"I started my 401k very late and luckily i work for a amazing company that has a\ngreat match program and stock purchase program.
