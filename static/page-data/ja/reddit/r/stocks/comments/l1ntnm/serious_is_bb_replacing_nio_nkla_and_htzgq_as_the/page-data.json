Yes, they seem to have a huge breakthrough just about to happen. Yes, they actually have an announcement or two. Yes, people have gotten excited and rushed in. But in nearly each case, the talk fizzled out and investors were left holding bags (hmm, yet to see what happens long term with NIO, but the rest still holds).</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m wondering if $BB is following in these footsteps. The price jumps seem so OTT in comparison to what they&#39;ve actually announced. Nearly 100% in a week, 52 week highs, highs not seen for 2.5 years?!</p>\n\n<p>What do others think about this? Is this just irrational exuberance by the market, or Pumpers, or Robinhooders looking for the next rocket to the moon? Or, do they really have something amazing buried underneath all the hype, and if so, what is it (with numbers, not just talk)?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l1ntnm/serious_is_bb_replacing_nio_nkla_and_htzgq_as_the/","title":"[Serious] Is $BB replacing $NIO, $NKLA, and $HTZGQ as the Meme Stock of 2021?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-21T23:57:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-21 23:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5ddc10e7-af2c-594a-b485-611f4da14459","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l1ntnm/serious_is_bb_replacing_nio_nkla_and_htzgq_as_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l1ntnm/serious_is_bb_replacing_nio_nkla_and_htzgq_as_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"djh_van","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/djh_van","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"djh_van","score":43,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"严重]巴恩斯B是否取代蔚来、$NKLA和$HTZGQ成为2021年的Meme股？","the_new_excerpt":"在近期巴恩斯B大幅飙升之后。\n[https://www.google.ca/search?q=bb&tbm=fin#scso=_JdMIYOP4E8nN0PEPr4Wh2Ag7:0]。\n我看的是事实。\n\n * 少量的利好消息（华为\n   [https://www.fxstreet.com/news/bb-stock-price-blackberry-ltd-soars-on-patent-deal-with-huawei-202101181109]\n   还有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"嚴重]巴恩斯B是否取代蔚來、$NKLA和$HTZGQ成爲2021年的Meme股？","the_new_excerpt":"在近期巴恩斯B大幅飆升之後。\n[https://www.google.ca/search?q=bb&tbm=fin#scso=_JdMIYOP4E8nN0PEPr4Wh2Ag7:0]。\n我看的是事實。\n\n * 少量的利好消息（華爲\n   [https://www.fxstreet.com/news/bb-stock-price-blackberry-ltd-soars-on-patent-deal-with-huawei-202101181109]\n   還有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-af67c740-2059-53ae-84fa-12c6e8c08744","excerpt":"Hello guys,\n\nThis is my first post.\n\nI recently started investment and haven't put much money into stocks (raised\nfrom pretty poor family)\n\nSo I am wondering how much money people are putting in stocks for investing or\ntrading?\n\nI currently put $5K which is really big to me.","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l2248v/i_am_wondering_how_much_people_have_put_in_stocks/","title":"I am wondering how much people have put in stocks","date":"January 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我想知道人们在股票上投入了多少钱？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n这是我的第一个帖子。\n\n我最近开始投资，还没有投入多少钱到股票上。\n寒门)\n\n所以，我想知道人们在股票上投入了多少钱，用于投资或。\n交易？\n\n我目前放了5千块钱，对我来说真的很大。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我想知道人們在股票上投入了多少錢？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n這是我的第一個帖子。\n\n我最近開始投資，還沒有投入多少錢到股票上。\n寒門)\n\n所以，我想知道人們在股票上投入了多少錢，用於投資或。\n交易？\n\n我目前放了5千塊錢，對我來說真的很大。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-c44a84c6-14e0-56c9-a882-5bb3950b7a24","excerpt":"I was reading Distillate Capital newsletter today and one analysis they\nhighlighted was quite interesting I think.
