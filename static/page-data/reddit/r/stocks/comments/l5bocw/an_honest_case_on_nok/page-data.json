Didn&#39;t have a big position to begin with, but still. You can see the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/8Nd0PUH\">screenshot of that transaction here</a>.  (It is in Finnish, but it says I sold 1150 shares at 3,18 on 8th of January).</p>\n\n<p>Now today, after some careful consideration, I decided to hop back in, with a bigger, 9k position. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/pxZiEhW\">Screen here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll tell you why. </p>\n\n<p>First of all, every Finn has an opinion about Nokia, and they&#39;re very sentimental and nostalgic about it.  The company made a lot of people rich and they hope it&#39;ll become one of the great ones someday. And they&#39;re willing to hang on through the toughest of times. I do not know how much of the hype on interest is made up and how much is real, but I&#39;m sure many Finns will view the latest surge in the stock price as a positive and - I believe - will jump back in and go long. The company has been all over the local news yesterday and today, so the media is adding to the hype. </p>\n\n<p>Second, I think the company has been undervalued for quite some time now. And I don&#39;t blame the investors. There was every reason to think that the company was done for. But now it genuinely looks like there is a meaningful change coming. It might take a few years, but the company has definitely renewed their strategy and is moving in the right direction. </p>\n\n<p>Third, the analysts seem to agree. In the past week at least 4 different analysts have upgraded their target price. Latest were banks Danske Bank to 4,30€ and Handelsbanken to 4,40€.</p>\n\n<p>To sum it up, the hype might not last, but I genuinely feel the potential is there.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5bocw/an_honest_case_on_nok/","title":"An honest case on NOK","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T19:42:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 19:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"08b1a01f-1ad1-5429-9f02-bb5d697f222b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5bocw/an_honest_case_on_nok/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l5bocw/an_honest_case_on_nok/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Iskari","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Iskari","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Iskari","score":64,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"关于NOK的诚实案例","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我一直看到这些帖子，关于黑幕账户试图炒作诺基亚等。\n不知道什么，但我觉得我应该船到这个对话。\n\n首先，几周前，我做了一个错误的决定（事后看20/20），我的决定是，我的手机是我的。\n决定卖掉我的NOK股票。没有一个大的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於NOK的誠實案例","the_new_excerpt":"大家好\n\n我一直看到這些帖子，關於黑幕賬戶試圖炒作諾基亞等。\n不知道什麼，但我覺得我應該船到這個對話。\n\n首先，幾周前，我做了一個錯誤的決定（事後看20/20），我的決定是，我的手機是我的。\n決定賣掉我的NOK股票。沒有一個大的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-9fded792-7036-5cf7-b817-214f3245e887","excerpt":"What if this is the new standard?\n\nWhat if with COVID, people realized they had a lot of unused money laying around\nand they decided to invest it in stock, bitcoin, gold and even collectibles\n(pokémon, magic and figures have seen huge spikes on extra-rare items).\n\nOf course, there is the side of…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/l54gji/what_if_this_was_not_a_bubble_but_a_price/","title":"What if this was not a bubble - but a price correction?","date":"January 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"如果这不是泡沫--而是价格修正呢？","the_new_excerpt":"如果这是新的标准呢？\n\n如果有了COVID，人们意识到他们有很多闲置的钱，怎么办？\n他们决定将其投资于股票、比特币、黄金甚至收藏品上\n(pokémon、魔法和人偶的特级品出现了巨大的飙升)。\n\n当然，还有一方面是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果這不是泡沫--而是價格修正呢？","the_new_excerpt":"如果這是新的標準呢？\n\n如果有了COVID，人們意識到他們有很多閒置的錢，怎麼辦？\n他們決定將其投資於股票、比特幣、黃金甚至收藏品上\n(pokémon、魔法和人偶的特級品出現了巨大的飆升)。\n\n當然，還有一方面是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-89713148-8318-5d24-b9f2-d13647bbff2d","excerpt":"Thinking this will really run, especially Tuesday, as the hyped demo day is\nafter hours then.\n\nIt seems by buying these contracts, gamma squeezes are artificially being made,\nI noticed this on different stocks as well, just pick the highest weekly strike\nand go all in. 15% to $40 PLTR is, will it…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l51xgw/103k_weekly_40c_pltr_contracts_purchased_today/","title":"103k weekly $40C PLTR contracts purchased today","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 26, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今天购买的10.3万周40C PLTR合约。","the_new_excerpt":"认为这将真正运行，特别是周二，因为催生的演示日是。\n那么下班后。\n\n看来通过买入这些合约，人为地进行了伽马挤压。\n我在不同的股票上也注意到了这一点，只要选择每周最高的罢工率\n并全力以赴。15%到40美元的PLTR是，将... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天購買的10.3萬周40C PLTR合約。","the_new_excerpt":"認爲這將真正運行，特別是週二，因爲催生的演示日是。\n那麼下班後。\n\n看來通過買入這些合約，人爲地進行了伽馬擠壓。\n我在不同的股票上也注意到了這一點，只要選擇每週最高的罷工率\n並全力以赴。15%到40美元的PLTR是，將... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-08b1a01f-1ad1-5429-9f02-bb5d697f222b","previousId":"RedditPost-9fded792-7036-5cf7-b817-214f3245e887","nextId":"RedditPost-89713148-8318-5d24-b9f2-d13647bbff2d","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/l5bocw/an_honest_case_on_nok/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
