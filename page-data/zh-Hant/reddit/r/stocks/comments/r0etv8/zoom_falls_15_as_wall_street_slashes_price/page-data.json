Millions of people used the company’s tech over the past nearly two years in order to keep up with school, work or socializing. But growth is slowing as people return to work and school.</p>\n\n<p>BTIG, which lowered its price target to $400 from $460, reiterated its buy rating, but said the cut was to “better reflect current market sentiment and group multiple compression.” Deutsche Bank Research also lowered its 12-month target to $280 from $350.</p>\n\n<p>Zoom opened at $218.05 on Tuesday and the stock is down more than 35% year-to-date.</p>\n\n<p>“While we’re positive on Zoom’s strategic initiatives and investments in key growth areas, we find it tougher to like a stock with more sharply decelerating growth and incremental pressure on profitability,” the researchers wrote in a Tuesday note.</p>\n\n<p>Baird, Guggenheim, Wells Fargo, Stifel, UBS, Piper Sandler and KeyBanc also dropped their price targets. But Wall Street is generally still bullish on Zoom’s future.</p>\n\n<p>“Moderating growth has been, and could continue to be a near-term stock headwind, though we remain positive on the long-term growth and platform opportunity particularly as the growth rate troughs over the next couple quarters,” Baird researchers wrote Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Zoom’s revenue increased 35% from a year earlier in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, slowing from 54% growth in the quarter before. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Zoom forecast adjusted earnings of $1.06 to $1.07 per share on $1.051 billion to $1.053 billion in revenue, which implies 19% growth.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r0etv8/zoom_falls_15_as_wall_street_slashes_price/","title":"Zoom falls 15% as Wall Street slashes price targets on earnings","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-23T17:31:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-23 17:31","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r0etv8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r0etv8/zoom_falls_15_as_wall_street_slashes_price/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r0etv8/zoom_falls_15_as_wall_street_slashes_price/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"caesar____augustus","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/caesar____augustus","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"caesar____augustus","score":44,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ズームは15％下落、ウォールストリートが業績に対する目標株価を引き下げたため","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/zoom-stock-falls-10percent-in-premarket-trading-as-firms-cut-price-targets.html\n\n-ビデオチャット会社であるズーム社が投資家に収益の低下を警告した後、同社の株式は火曜日に下落しました。\nの株は火曜日に下落しました。\n\n-この報告により、ウォールストリートの銀行はZoomの目標株価を引き下げました。\n\nズーム社の株式は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"华尔街因收益问题下调目标价，Zoom下跌15%。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/zoom-stock-falls-10percent-in-premarket-trading-as-firms-cut-price-targets.html\n\n-在视频聊天公司警告投资者收入放缓后，Zoom的股票周二出现下跌。\n报道称，视频聊天公司警告投资者收入放缓。\n\n-该报告导致华尔街银行削减了该股的目标价格。\n\n缩放公司的股票...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"華爾街因收益問題下調目標價，Zoom下跌15%。","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/zoom-stock-falls-10percent-in-premarket-trading-as-firms-cut-price-targets.html\n\n-在視頻聊天公司警告投資者收入放緩後，Zoom的股票週二出現下跌。\n報道稱，視頻聊天公司警告投資者收入放緩。\n\n-該報告導致華爾街銀行削減了該股的目標價格。\n\n縮放公司的股票...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1463145545804009474","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1463145545804009474","title":"Dollar Tree is raising prices for good, moving its price point from a dollar to $1.25. https://t.co/G9pdPzShE6","date":"November 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"ダラー・ツリーが良い意味での値上げを行い、価格帯を1ドルから1.25ドルに変更 https://t.co/G9pdPzShE6","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"https://t.co/G9pdPzShE6，Dollar Tree正在提高价格，将其价位从一美元提高到1.25美元。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"https://t.co/G9pdPzShE6，Dollar Tree正在提高價格，將其價位從一美元提高到1.25美元。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-r0f44w","excerpt":"from:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/house-passes-build-back-better-act-retirement-plans-for-the-wealthy.html\n\n\"The House legislation would address both.\n\nFirstly, it would prohibit any after-tax contributions in 401(k) and other\nworkplace plans and IRAs from being converted to Roth savings.
