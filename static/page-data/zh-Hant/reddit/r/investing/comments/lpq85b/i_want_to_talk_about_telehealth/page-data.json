I&#39;m not going to run through why telehealth is bigger now than it was before 2020. It&#39;s obvious. </p>\n\n<p>So, I&#39;ve been checking out all the telehealth companies, specifically AMWL, since they’ve been booming and I’m wondering if anyone has found anything different.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the players I’m looking at right now: AMWL, TDOC, CVS, ANTM; with my primary focus being on AMWL. </p>\n\n<p>AMWL: Full disclosure, I’ve been heavily following them since their Q3 earnings call. Launched its IPO in Sept. 2020 where it was $18 and had a three month high of $42. Stock is currently trading just under $30, and IMO is highly undervalued. Results from Q3 show that the company had more than 1.4 million virtual visits, a 450% increase from the same period in 2019. Revenue from Q3 was $62.6 million, an 80% increase. From what I’ve been seeing, I&#39;m expecting an increase from the Q4 results as well. I dug up some info, and it’s got an investment of $100 million from Google. Also a partnership with Cleveland Clinic, and a recently launched telepsychiatry service, so there must be something here with large interest from these companies. It’s still at an attainable price and my thoughts are, since the telehealth industry is booming, this looks like the next one to grow. </p>\n\n<p>TDOC: If you don’t know, TDOC had it’s IPO in July of 2015 at $19 a share and now hovers in the $280s. TDOC’s 5-year trend shows that telehealth stocks haven’t JUST been growing because of the pandemic. TDOC has been growing for years, with a 179% stock price increase between its IPO in 2015 and November of 2019. This could be because it was the main player for so long (founded in 2002) and the only health service looking to the future of technology in health for some time. Q4 earnings aren’t yet announced, as none of the others have announced either, but I don’t know if I should bother this late in the game to invest. Short-term signals are positive.</p>\n\n<p>CVS: The company started trading under the ticker we all recognize in 1996, but CVS didn’t enter the telehealth market until 2018 through a partnership with the big guy above, TDOC. CVS saw a 600% increase in its MinuteClinic virtual visits from Q1 of 2019 to Q2 of 2020. It’s got a tumultuous history, so that’s probably why it’s currently undervalued. But is it going to keep growing? It seems extremely diverse as a pharmacy and it bought out Aetna a couple years ago, so now a healthcare provider as well. But it just fell, again, so is this still a solid stock? From what I’m reading, the long-term health of the stock is still trying to find a solid footing. </p>\n\n<p>ANTM: this is an independent licensee of BCBS and is the 5th largest publicly traded health benefits company in the US. Its origins go back to the 40’s as Mutual Hospital Insurance, Inc. After years of mergers and growth, it went public in 2001 and then expanded into the telehealth sphere in 2018. ANTM opened in Oct 2001 at $20.25. I’m reading that it looks like Q4 is going to have a below average return. I am seeing that some are saying that it may be undervalued but from what I’m reading the stock is in the middle of a falling trend in the short term. There are also expectations that it’s supposed to fall up to 5.57% more in the next few months. </p>\n\n<p>Some thoughts: TDOC is part of the EDOC ETF which recently launched last summer. Solid ETF choice that’s seen a 28% growth in the last 3 months. We see SO MUCH about ARKK, but I’m thinking EDOC is overlooked. My thoughts: getting into EDOC to mitigate risk, and investing individually in AMWL. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: no brainer: telehealth is up, but I’m hyped on AMWL. Best-in-class technology stack, huge partner investments, incredible price upside, major revenue increases with what looks to be a positive Q4 earnings call. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lpq85b/i_want_to_talk_about_telehealth/","title":"I Want To Talk About Telehealth","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"February 22, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-22T17:42:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-22 17:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"e1269962-7a8c-5c12-82a3-194c659a1d32","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lpq85b/i_want_to_talk_about_telehealth/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lpq85b/i_want_to_talk_about_telehealth/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"lucinabeach10Iu","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/lucinabeach10Iu","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"lucinabeach10Iu","score":203,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我想谈谈远程医疗","the_new_excerpt":"关于远程医疗，我还真没怎么看过，所以我想我应该把我的2分钱放进去。\n我一直在看的东西和我发现的东西。我不打算跑过为什么\n现在的远程医疗比2020年之前更大。这是显而易见的。 \n\n所以，我一直在查看所有的远程医疗公司，具体...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我想談談遠程醫療","the_new_excerpt":"關於遠程醫療，我還真沒怎麼看過，所以我想我應該把我的2分錢放進去。\n我一直在看的東西和我發現的東西。我不打算跑過爲什麼\n現在的遠程醫療比2020年之前更大。這是顯而易見的。 \n\n所以，我一直在查看所有的遠程醫療公司，具體...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-6c5f5739-37e0-5882-a1f2-bf98356b2ed4","excerpt":"These managers made bank\n\nToday, Institutional Investor unveiled the 20th edition of its Rich…","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lpodbg/last_year_the_top_25_managers_earned_32_billion/","title":"Last year, the top 25 managers earned $32 billion even as the economy crashed and markets wobbled.","date":"February 22, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"去年，即使在经济崩溃、市场摇摆不定的情况下，前25名经理人也赚了320亿美元。","the_new_excerpt":"这些经理人在银行\n\n今天，《机构投资者》揭晓了第20期《富...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"去年，即使在經濟崩潰、市場搖擺不定的情況下，前25名經理人也賺了320億美元。","the_new_excerpt":"這些經理人在銀行\n\n今天，《機構投資者》揭曉了第20期《富...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-7ae4591f-16b8-5732-9a61-940cd17df317","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/apple-beats-samsung-takes-global-smartphone-lead-in-q4.html\n\nApple shipped more smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2020 than any other\ncompany, including its rival Samsung, according to an estimate from market\nresearcher Gartner.\n\nIt’s the first time Apple has been…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lpqe3r/apple_reclaims_global_smartphone_lead_ahead_of/","title":"Apple reclaims global smartphone lead ahead of Samsung for first time since 2016","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 22, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"苹果自2016年以来首次夺回全球智能手机领先三星的地位","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/apple-beats-samsung-takes-global-smartphone-lead-in-q4.html\n\n苹果在2020年第四季度的智能手机出货量比其他任何一家都多\n公司，包括其竞争对手三星，根据市场的估计。\n研究人员Gartner。\n\n这是苹果公司首次被...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"蘋果自2016年以來首次奪回全球智能手機領先三星的地位","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/apple-beats-samsung-takes-global-smartphone-lead-in-q4.html\n\n蘋果在2020年第四季度的智能手機出貨量比其他任何一家都多\n公司，包括其競爭對手三星，根據市場的估計。\n研究人員Gartner。\n\n這是蘋果公司首次被...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-e1269962-7a8c-5c12-82a3-194c659a1d32","previousId":"RedditPost-6c5f5739-37e0-5882-a1f2-bf98356b2ed4","nextId":"RedditPost-7ae4591f-16b8-5732-9a61-940cd17df317","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lpq85b/i_want_to_talk_about_telehealth/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
