Nothing legendary, but I’ve picked up a few patterns in the few years I started using Reddit for investing advice. </p>\n\n<p>One thing I like to think I picked up were classic signs of a pump and dump.

Nobodies reading that shit</p>\n\n<p>Has a bunch of bolds and italics to make it look legit</p>\n\n<p>Shit stock that’s been shit for awhile</p>\n\n<p>Outrageous price target. Seriously, over 100% in a week? What in the fuck?</p>\n\n<p>I bet you my entire life savings 90% of the people who bought in have no idea what this company is and stopped reading after “biopharma”</p>\n\n<p>RemindMe! 2 weeks</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/bPGbhRl.jpgThe\">The post was posted a day before its complete highs</a> Just wanted to use this post as an example/warning to new investors.
