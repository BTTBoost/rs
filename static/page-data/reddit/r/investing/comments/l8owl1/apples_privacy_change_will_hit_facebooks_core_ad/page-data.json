Facebook in August pointed to a small corner of its business that facilitates ad placements on third-party sites and apps. It has also played up how the change would hit small developers.</p>\n\n<p>The core of Facebook’s business, its flagship app and Instagram, would be under pressure, too. The Apple change will require mobile apps to seek users’ permission before tracking their activity, restricting the flow of data Facebook gets from apps to help build profiles of its users. Those profiles allow Facebook’s advertisers to target their ads efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>“The market dynamics here are going to shift heavily,” said Simon Poulton, vice president of digital intelligence at WPromote, a digital-marketing agency. “If you are marketing on Facebook and the results are going down because the efficiency is going down, you are going to turn that down.”</p>\n\n<p>The extent of the potential financial impact on Facebook, which generated $86 billion in revenue last year, isn’t clear. The company said it expects revenue to be stable in the next two quarters. In the past year, Facebook’s business has thrived despite the coronavirus pandemic and a boycott by several advertisers over hate speech on its platform.</p>\n\n<p>Eric Seufert, an analyst and marketing strategy consultant who has studied Facebook’s business, said he expects the company to take a 7% revenue hit in the second quarter as marketers spend less and ad prices decline as a result of Apple’s change.</p>\n\n<p>Madan Bharadwaj, chief technology officer and co-founder of Measured, a marketing measurement company, estimates that Facebook will only be able to claim credit for about 50% of the sales it currently does, as a result of the change.</p>\n\n<p>“It’s going to have a huge impact on the total amount of revenue, or conversions, that Facebook can attribute to itself, which is basically the signal that all advertisers use for making investment decisions,” he said. “It’s going to drop their performance metrics hugely.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-change-will-hit-facebooks-core-ad-business-heres-how-11611938750\">Apple’s Privacy Change Will Hit Facebook’s Core Ad Business.
