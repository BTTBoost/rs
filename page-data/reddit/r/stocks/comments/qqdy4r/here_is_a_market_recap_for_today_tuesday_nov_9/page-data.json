In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). </p>\n\n<p>With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf\">https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Marci McGregor, Bank of America Merryl Lynch Senior Investment Strategist said, “I still think it’s all about corporate profits.  I know a lot of my peers are concerned that peak earnings growth is behind us. But I think peak earnings isn’t even a 2022 story. We’re seeing solid consumer demand, a strong U.S. economy, and I think we’re going to have a capex cycle in 2022. And I think that’s all positive for corporate profits, and that underpins this market, in my view.”</p>\n\n<p>However, despite positive earnings, a host of companies have cited constraints around raw materials, labor shortages, and general supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. According to Bank of America, mentions of supply chains on quarterly earnings calls have surged by 360% compared to last year, underscoring the widespread nature of these pressures. These supply-related issues have also contributed to still-elevated inflationary trends. Tuesday&#39;s Producer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that producer prices rose by 8.6% over last year, matching October&#39;s rate for the fastest on record in data going back to Nov. 2010. </p>\n\n<p>Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco, said “I would expect inflation to peak by mid-year 2022. It should remain elevated but it should move lower in the back half of 2022. So while this is certainly an issue, it is part of what we should expect coming out of the pandemic. We have gotten out of a burning building, but we should expect that there is a little smoke and water damage as a result. That’s really what we’re experiencing with elevated inflation and supply chain disruptions”. I agree with this position and think the analogy is very apt. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 10%, pushing down the entire EV sector with it, as the stock price feels the effect of Elon Musk’s poll where he said he would be selling 10% of his stake in Tesla. </li>\n<li>President Biden interviewed Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard for the job of Chairperson, signaling a serious rival to Jerome Powell Powell as Biden is set to nominate a new leader to the Fed in the coming weeks. I really hope Powell is re-assigned, the market does not need a shakeup right now.</li>\n<li>Peloton (PTON) continued its sharp drop following earnings, dispute the company revealing a new product designed to track your performance on the bike and give you feedback</li>\n<li>Roblox (RBLX) stock gapped up hard today while PayPal (PYPL) fell after reporting earnings yesterday afternoon. </li>\n<li>Twitter (TWTR) launched a new subscription service, called Twitter Blue for $3 a month that allows one to undo or correct tweets, among other mostly aesthetic upgrades.</li>\n<li>NVIDIA (NVDA), my favorite stock, said it was partnering with a range of self-driving sensor companies, including lidar firm Luminar Technologies (LAZR), to put together a system for autonomous driving as soon as 2024.</li>\n<li>Moreover, NVIDIA also announced it was releasing a set of tools, called “Omniverse Enterprise”. Their Omniverse, which was beta launched in December, is a simulation and collaboration platform which “serves as the connective tissue for physically accurate 3D virtual worlds,” according to the company. In prepared remarks, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in his keynote address that with Omniverse, “we now have the technology to create new 3D worlds or model our physical world.” Omniverse Enterprise, which costs $9,000 a year, is also available to customers in a 30-day trial. Just another example of how NVIDIA is going key to powering technology of the future.<br/></li>\n<li>Netflix (NFLX) is launching a new TikTok-like short clip feature for kids called “Kids Clips” as soon as this week. Netflix said it would add new shirts based on its current and future offerings.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with two target raises.
