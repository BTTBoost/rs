My portfolio currently consists of nine stocks. I’ve been looking into options trading recently which involves high risk but can give high returns if I know what I’m doing. However, investing in established companies is obviously safer but takes longer to build wealth unless I have at least $200,000 in the market, and I can’t afford to deposit anywhere near that amount right now. Between investing in a diverse set of stocks, investing in two or three startup company stocks that may blow up one day, or doing options trading, which of these strategies do you think would be the easiest for building significant wealth within ten years?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r24bqb/investing_vs_trading_what_is_the_easiest_way_to/","title":"Investing vs Trading: What is the easiest way to build wealth?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-26T19:34:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-26 19:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"r24bqb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r24bqb/investing_vs_trading_what_is_the_easiest_way_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r24bqb/investing_vs_trading_what_is_the_easiest_way_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"jermonreddit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/jermonreddit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"jermonreddit","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"投資vs.トレーディング 富を築く最も簡単な方法は何か？","the_new_excerpt":"今年の2月から26,000ドルを株式市場に預けて投資しています。\n今年の2月に26,000ドルを株式市場に預け、現在33,014ドルなので、これまでに25％の利益を得ています。私の\n私のポートフォリオは現在、9つの銘柄で構成されています。最近、オプション取引に注目しています。\n最近は、リスクは高いがリターンの大きいオプション取引を検討していますが...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"投资与交易。什么是最简单的财富积累方式？","the_new_excerpt":"我从今年2月开始投资，在股市中存入了26,000美元。\n股票市场，目前我已经达到33,014美元，所以到目前为止我赚了25%的利润。我的\n我的投资组合目前由九只股票组成。我一直在研究期权\n交易，这涉及高风险，但可以带来高回报......","locale":"zh"},{"title":"投資與交易。什麼是最簡單的財富積累方式？","the_new_excerpt":"我從今年2月開始投資，在股市中存入了26,000美元。\n股票市場，目前我已經達到33,014美元，所以到目前爲止我賺了25%的利潤。我的\n我的投資組合目前由九隻股票組成。我一直在研究期權\n交易，這涉及高風險，但可以帶來高回報......","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-r2pexn","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r2pexn/thanks_for_the_insurance_money/","title":"Thanks for the insurance money","date":"November 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"保険金に感謝","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"谢谢你的保险金","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"謝謝你的保險金","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1464136788583329792","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1464136788583329792","title":"A heavily-mutated Covid variant emerges in Southern Africa\n\nFuck off","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 26, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"アフリカ南部でCovidの高変異型が出現\n\nファックオフ","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"南部非洲出现一个严重变异的Covid变体\n\n扯淡","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"南部非洲出現一個嚴重變異的Covid變體\n\n扯淡","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-r24bqb","previousId":"RedditPost-r2pexn","nextId":"TweetPost-1464136788583329792","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/r24bqb/investing_vs_trading_what_is_the_easiest_way_to/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
