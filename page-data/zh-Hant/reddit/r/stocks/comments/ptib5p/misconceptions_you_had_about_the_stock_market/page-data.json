What are some misconceptions you once had about the stock market? They can range from any time in your life when you were exposed to the market, be it as a child who knew nothing to an adult who was researching it hoping to invest or trade.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll start with a few of mine from when I was a child.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In Chinese, “stock” is “gǔ piào” (literally: “stock-share ticket”). However, the first character is pronounced exactly as the same as the term for “drum” (“gǔ,” although the written character is different). When I first learned about the market in Chinese, I kept thinking it meant “drum ticket” and used my own wild imaginations to picture what such a thing would look like.</p></li>\n<li><p>The first time I heard “Dow Jones,” I thought it was “Down Jones” and immediately jumped to the conclusion that the market must be called “Up Jones” on days when it went up. When “Up Jones” never appeared, I wondered why people would keep calling it “Down Jones” when the price clearly was going up.</p></li>\n<li><p>The first time I watched business news covering the market (pre-Internet days), I had no idea what was causing these stock prices to go up or down. I just thought all these companies were scoring points in some kind of game, so I kept waiting for the toy companies to show up just to see their scores.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yours?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ptib5p/misconceptions_you_had_about_the_stock_market/","title":"Misconceptions you had about the stock market once upon a time","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-23T07:39:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-23 07:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ptib5p","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ptib5p/misconceptions_you_had_about_the_stock_market/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ptib5p/misconceptions_you_had_about_the_stock_market/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"ZhangtheGreat","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ZhangtheGreat","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ZhangtheGreat","score":86,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"昔、株式市場に抱いていた勘違い","the_new_excerpt":"自分の歴史を振り返って、ちょっと笑ってみましょう。あなたがかつて持っていた\nあなたがかつて株式市場に対して抱いていた誤解は何ですか？それは、人生の中でマーケットに触れた時期に関わらず\n何も知らなかった子供の頃から、投資のために調べていた大人になってからなど、人生の中で市場に触れた時期は様々です。\n何も知らなかった子供の頃から、投資をしたいと思って調べていた大人になってから...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"曾经的你对股市的误解","the_new_excerpt":"让我们回顾一下我们自己的历史，笑一笑。有哪些\n你曾经对股票市场有哪些误解？它们可能来自于你生命中任何时候\n在你的生活中，当你接触到市场时，无论是作为一个一无所知的孩子\n到希望投资或研究市场的成年人。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"曾經的你對股市的誤解","the_new_excerpt":"讓我們回顧一下我們自己的歷史，笑一笑。有哪些\n你曾經對股票市場有哪些誤解？它們可能來自於你生命中任何時候\n在你的生活中，當你接觸到市場時，無論是作爲一個一無所知的孩子\n到希望投資或研究市場的成年人。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ptmnsj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ptmnsj/a_friend_never_bet_against_america_spy_puts/","title":"A friend, Never bet against America. $SPY PUTS","date":"September 23, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"A friend, Never bet against America. $SPY PUTS","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"一个朋友，永远不要和美国打赌。悉尼指数","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個朋友，永遠不要和美國打賭。悉尼指數","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1440874804395999232","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1440874804395999232","title":"UNSEALED VIDEO OF THE JANUARY 6th “COUP”, WORST INSURRECTION SINCE GEN LEE RAISED AN ARMY FOR VIRGINIA https://t.co/EgSfdlIswd","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 23, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"1月6日の「クーデター」の未公開ビデオ、GEN LEEがVIRGINIAのために軍隊を編成したとき以来の最悪の危機 https://t.co/EgSfdlIswd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"1月6日 \"政变 \"的未公开视频，这是李将军为弗吉尼亚州组建军队以来最糟糕的保险事件 https://t.co/EgSfdlIswd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"1月6日 \"政變 \"的未公開視頻，這是李將軍爲弗吉尼亞州組建軍隊以來最糟糕的保險事件 https://t.co/EgSfdlIswd","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ptib5p","previousId":"RedditPost-ptmnsj","nextId":"TweetPost-1440874804395999232","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ptib5p/misconceptions_you_had_about_the_stock_market/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
