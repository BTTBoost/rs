The Dow Jones (DIA) traded modestly even and remains roughly $2 from its record high. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued rallying after steeply underperforming last week, climbing roughly 3% in the last two days. After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give his annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>This earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. </p>\n\n<p>Keith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist at Truist Financial, gave this take about earnings, “We think the primary trend is higher. We’re only about one year into this economic expansion. Expansions typically last about five years, And the earnings season which we just got out of was phenomenal. Even if it’s peak growth, we still think it’s going to be strong growth. You have earnings moving forward and then you look at the relative comparison of stocks relative to bonds and they’re still attractive. Overall, we think the right position is to be overweight stocks.”</p>\n\n<p>US Crude oil prices gained for a second straight session, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.</p>\n\n<p>Energy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer&#39;s coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of “meme stocks” like AMC and Gamestop (GME) and others had a great day today, building on advances in recent sessions. </li>\n<li>Shares of travel and leisure companies are rebounding following the FDA’s full approval of their coronavirus vaccine, which hopefully encourages more vaccinations and allows the country to reopen faster</li>\n<li>Shares of Airbnb (ABNB) gapped up more than 8% amid this broader rebound by travel and leisure stocks</li>\n<li>According to the Department of Commerce, sales of new homes unexpectedly rose in July, suggesting some firming up in housing market activity amid high prices and low inventory. New home sales increased 1.0% in July compared to June, bringing sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000. Consensus economists were looking for a rate of 697,000 homes. Sales in June were also upwardly revised to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 701,000, from the 676,000 previously reported. </li>\n<li>Shares of Chinese companies rebounded somewhat following an intense sell-off amid regulatory pressure from the government. </li>\n<li>Shares of Peloton (PTON) rose after the company announced it was restarting sales of its treadmill following a recall earlier in the year </li>\n<li>Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) self-driving spin-off Waymo is starting testing in San Francisco with the aim to start a robotaxi service within the next 3 years.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices.*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>AutoDesk (ADSK) target raised by Barclays from $340 to $370 at Overweight.
