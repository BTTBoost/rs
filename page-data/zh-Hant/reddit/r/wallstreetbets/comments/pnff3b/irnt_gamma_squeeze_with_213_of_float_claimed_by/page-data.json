It had seemingly been written off despite the fact that it&#39;s been primed for a gamma squeeze at almost every moment since it came down from that run to $40. To be clear, this is a real gamma squeeze, not a meme-y play. This is a rare situation and that&#39;s why I&#39;m calling attention to it.</p>\n\n<p>The setup is simple:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The float is currently 1.3M shares due to SPAC redemptions &amp; lockups and will be at this number until after options expiry on Sep 17th.</li>\n<li>It has options, which usually are only available for stocks over 7M float</li>\n<li>Almost 200% of those 1.3M shares are claimed by the already ITM open interest on the call options. This means that the squeeze has ALREADY been set in motion and you&#39;re just waiting for time to draw closer to expiration. The movement we saw Friday is what we refer to as a &quot;pre-squeeze&quot; movement, there is likely far more to come.</li>\n<li>On Friday the $20 strike became ITM and instantly doubled the amount of the float that is claimed by the open interest.</li>\n<li>As of this morning ORTEX shows 4.3M shares shorted which amounts to 336% SI with a cost to borrow of 628% on average. I have doubts about the accuracy of this specific data because that would put the amount of the float claimed by institutional obligations nearing 600%, <del>so I&#39;ll stick with saying that the last reliable data seemingly had SI at around 13%</del> Ihor&#39;s tweet new tweet puts SI at 56% of float with the same elevated cost to borrow.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If $IRNT runs, it could potentially be the first true infinity squeeze since VW and has the potential to beat the heights of $ORGO &amp; $GME.</p>\n\n<p>$IRNT will very likely start running some time before expiration on Sep 17th. It could be today, it could be Thursday, but at some point, the buy volume will likely come in and the IV on the options will spike to crazy heights almost instantly.</p>\n\n<p>Be warned, this play is incredible risky, if you choose to partake only do so with money you can afford to lose.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.</p>\n\n<p>Credit for the original DD on this goes to <a href=\"/u/Undercover_in_SF\">/u/Undercover_in_SF</a> -- His posts are what turned me onto the low float.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT #1: Per Ihor&#39;s tweet, SI is at 728.46K shares, which puts current SI at 56% of float. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19\">https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19</a> -- I have reached out to ORTEX to confirm their numbers which put SI at a significantly higher 5.11M.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT #2: ORTEX has confirmed that the 5.11M data is incorrect due to a mismatch with current loans and exchange reported short interest. After review, it looks like Ihor&#39;s tweet is accurately portraying current short interest and the 56% of float stands for now. Big thanks to ORTEX who are always incredibly helpful. This brings the total institutional obligations to 235% of FF as of today.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/","title":"$IRNT - Gamma squeeze with 213% of float claimed by OI & SI","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"September 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-14T13:54:25.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-14 13:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pnff3b","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"StonkGodCapital","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/StonkGodCapital","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"StonkGodCapital","score":1470,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"$IRNT - OIとSIで浮動株の213%を主張するガンマ・スクイーズ","the_new_excerpt":"私は$IRNTを市場後のジャンプで16ドルから40ドルになった時から追っています。\n40ドルになりました。それは、そこから下がってきたときから、ほとんどすべての瞬間にガンマ・スクイーズの準備ができていたという事実にもかかわらず、見捨てられたように見えました。\n40ドルへの上昇から下降してきたとき、ほとんどすべての瞬間にガンマ・スクイーズの準備ができていたにもかかわらず、この銘柄は見捨てられたように見えました。\n40ドルになってからは、ほとんどすべての瞬間にガンマ・スクイーズの準備ができているにもかかわらず、見放されたように見えました。はっきり言って、これはミームではなく本物のガンマ・スクイーズです。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"$IRNT - Gamma挤压，OI和SI声称有213%的流通量","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在关注IRNT美元，因为它在市场上从16美元跳到了40美元。\n40美元的AH。它似乎已经被注销了，尽管事实是它已经为伽马挤压做好了准备。\n自从它从16美元涨到40美元后，几乎每时每刻都在为伽玛挤压做准备。\n跑到40美元后，它几乎每时每刻都在酝酿一场伽马式的挤压。要清楚的是，这是一个真正的伽马挤压，而不是一个备忘录...。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"$IRNT - Gamma擠壓，OI和SI聲稱有213%的流通量","the_new_excerpt":"我一直在關注IRNT美元，因爲它在市場上從16美元跳到了40美元。\n40美元的AH。它似乎已經被註銷了，儘管事實是它已經爲伽馬擠壓做好了準備。\n自從它從16美元漲到40美元后，幾乎每時每刻都在爲伽瑪擠壓做準備。\n跑到40美元后，它幾乎每時每刻都在醞釀一場伽馬式的擠壓。要清楚的是，這是一個真正的伽馬擠壓，而不是一個備忘錄...。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-po1uc9","excerpt":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-amazon-boosts-hourly-pay-103153407.html\n\nSept 14 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc hiked its average starting wage to $18 per\nhour on Tuesday and said it plans to hire more than 125,000 warehouse and\ntransportation workers in the United States.\n\nThe world's largest online…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/po1uc9/update_1amazon_boosts_hourly_pay_to_over_18_to/","title":"UPDATE 1-Amazon boosts hourly pay to over $18, to hire 125,000 workers","date":"September 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"UPDATE 1-アマゾン、時給を18ドル以上に引き上げ、12万5千人を雇用へ","the_new_excerpt":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-amazon-boosts-hourly-pay-103153407.html\n\n9月14日 ロイター］ - アマゾン・ドット・コムは14日、平均初任給を時給18ドルに引き上げた。\n時給を18ドルに引き上げ、今後12万5,000人以上の倉庫・運送業者を雇用する予定であると発表した。\nまた、125,000人以上の倉庫労働者と運送労働者を雇用する計画を発表した。\n\n世界最大のオンライン企業であるAmazon...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"更新1-亚马逊将时薪提高到18美元以上，将招聘12.5万名工人","the_new_excerpt":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-amazon-boosts-hourly-pay-103153407.html\n\n9月14日（路透社）--亚马逊公司周二将其平均起薪提高到每小时18美元\n周二，亚马逊公司将其平均起薪提高到每小时18美元，并表示它计划在美国雇用超过125,000名仓库和运输工人。\n运输工人。\n\n这家全球最大的网络公司将于9月1日开始招聘员工。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"更新1-亞馬遜將時薪提高到18美元以上，將招聘12.5萬名工人","the_new_excerpt":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-amazon-boosts-hourly-pay-103153407.html\n\n9月14日（路透社）--亞馬遜公司週二將其平均起薪提高到每小時18美元\n週二，亞馬遜公司將其平均起薪提高到每小時18美元，並表示它計劃在美國僱用超過125,000名倉庫和運輸工人。\n運輸工人。\n\n這家全球最大的網絡公司將於9月1日開始招聘員工。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-pnpz8s","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnpz8s/wsb_passing_around_the_same_1200_dollar_stimulus/","title":"Wsb passing around the same 1200 dollar stimulus check","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 14, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"同じく1200ドルの景気刺激策の小切手を回しているWsb","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"Wsb传递着同样的1200美元的刺激性支票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Wsb傳遞着同樣的1200美元的刺激性支票","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pnff3b","previousId":"RedditPost-po1uc9","nextId":"RedditPost-pnpz8s","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
