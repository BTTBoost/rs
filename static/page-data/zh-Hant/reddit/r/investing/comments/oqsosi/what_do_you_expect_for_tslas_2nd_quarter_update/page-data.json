Just getting a status update on what everyone thinks may happen this quarter and in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Just to throw some possibilities around, here are some discussion points. </p>\n\n<p>What do you expect this quarter? Will it be enough to push Tesla back above $700?</p>\n\n<p>Will having Bitcoin on the balance sheet have an effect on their quarter? It&#39;s dropped some but not that much. It will be  slightly negative this quarter, but could bounce back again if Bitcoin runs again.</p>\n\n<p>How do you think the stock will react if Tesla rolls out Full self driving that can drive people to work? The new subscription model is out, so FSDAAS is now an option, how does that effect their revenue next quarter and long term? How soon do you think FSD rolls out to wide release? It&#39;s already looking very impressive, but still needs some fine tuning. Will it be v10 or v11 that is capable? Is the processor enough to handle level 4 driving? What will be needed for level 5 FSD? </p>\n\n<p>How soon will the Austin and Berlin plants open up to production? Are they duplicating problem solving of the 4680 Model Y line between Texas and Germany? Who is farther along? Is Berlin almost ready to go and just delayed by permit processes? Will the new factories be covered in solar panels?</p>\n\n<p>What is the going forward plans for letting other auto manufacturers use the Tesla charging network? Elon just mentioned Tesla will allow other EV&#39;s to use their network. Will all new chargers be pass through with 300kwh charging? That will be needed for the cybertruck. How big will their charging network need to grow, and how will that effect their revenue? Will they charge more for other manufacturers? How do they set that up? I assume it will be a Tesla adapter you buy that connects to your phone app.</p>\n\n<p>Will Tesla start manufacturing the semi soon? Do they have enough 4680 cells? Which location will be producing 4680 cells next, and is the final process completed?  </p>\n\n<p>What is the status on the updated cybertruck, and when will it be updated to show any other features? The 8 ton press has not arrived in Texas yet for the cybertruck castings. How far along are the designs for production? </p>\n\n<p>What grid scale battery projects are they working on now?</p>\n\n<p>What is delaying the S right now? It&#39;s hit pause on deliveries at the moment. Was the plaid fire a cause for concern on the battery? Will the steering yoke affect sales that much?</p>\n\n<p>Any further updates on the Model 2 and what&#39;s the plan for release on a $25k Tesla? How soon will it be debuted and when will it be released?</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the plans for AI day? Elon said this month, but will we get an update? How far along is DoJo? Will it speed up training for machine learning? Will it allow for processing far bigger datasets for self-driving? Where is it going to be located? Will Tesla release FSD before DoJo is online?</p>\n\n<p>How is the chip shortage affecting production? It seems like most Tesla vehicles are sold out through the entire quarter already at all sites. </p>\n\n<p>What is the options market like for Tesla right now?</p>\n\n<p>What else do you expect from Tesla and where do you see them later this decade? Can other manufacturers keep up with their battery innovation? The bolt is being recalled for major issues, the Taycan was recalled for firmware updates, Volkswagen is having major software issues, Rivian and Lucid are delayed on deliveries. Will competitors overtake Tesla in EV production this decade?</p>\n\n<p>Made a couple edits to the post adding a couple other points and fixed grammar and spelling.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oqsosi/what_do_you_expect_for_tslas_2nd_quarter_update/","title":"What do you expect for TSLA's 2nd quarter update on Monday and what are your long term expectations?","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"July 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-24T18:29:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-24 18:29","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"7e76efd2-da0b-516a-8cae-13218377c7f4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oqsosi/what_do_you_expect_for_tslas_2nd_quarter_update/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oqsosi/what_do_you_expect_for_tslas_2nd_quarter_update/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"rideincircles","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rideincircles","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rideincircles","score":338,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"月曜日に行われるTSLAの第2四半期のアップデートについて、長期的にはどのような期待をしていますか？","the_new_excerpt":"このサブは最近、テスラについて語ることが少なくなってきているようです。ただ\n今期、そして将来的に何が起こるかについて、皆さんが考えていることをお伝えします。\n状況をお知らせします。\n\nいくつかの可能性を議論するために、ここでいくつかの論点を挙げてみましょう。\n\n今期は何を期待していますか？それは...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你对TSLA周一的第二季度更新有何期待，你的长期预期是什么？","the_new_excerpt":"这个子最近似乎对讨论特斯拉非常安静。只是\n我想了解一下大家对本季度和未来可能发生的事情的看法。\n未来。\n\n只是为了抛出一些可能性，这里有一些讨论点。\n\n你对本季度的预期是什么？它是否足以推动...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你對TSLA週一的第二季度更新有何期待，你的長期預期是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"這個子最近似乎對討論特斯拉非常安靜。只是\n我想了解一下大家對本季度和未來可能發生的事情的看法。\n未來。\n\n只是爲了拋出一些可能性，這裏有一些討論點。\n\n你對本季度的預期是什麼？它是否足以推動...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-8b996c0e-50f0-5150-9233-33f9561965d5","excerpt":"I use Fidelity and want to use a hands-off approach in my brokerage account and\nideally, I'd like to simply automate investing -- 80% total market and 20% total\ninternational, every month.
