Copper is important for the production of electronic devices and of renewable sources of energy. To add to that, it is also important for everything that’s electric, manufacturing batteries, and even for solar panels. There is a high demand for it and it is unlikely that it will go down soon.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of big mining companies that are producing massive amounts of copper such as Codelco. Just last year, Codelco was the largest producer of copper, producing 1.73 million tonnes, which was 1.3% higher than their last year’s performance. BHP, which owns the world’s largest copper mine, comes in second producing 1.77 million tonnes.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of smaller companies are joining as well too, and are in for producing tons of the metal too as shown by their drilling results. I believe that these smaller and new companies will contribute greatly to the copper supply boost, which will also help ease the situation of the rising prices.</p>\n\n<p>Among them is Three Valley Copper (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tvc.v/\">TVC.V</a>), a Canadian company producing pure copper cathodes from its mineral reserves. They recently released their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore from Don Gabriel. The company expects high unit costs throughout the year until next year since they are aiming to operate below capacity. There are also explorations that are showing potential like Wedgemount Resources who recently found new mineralized zones. Both senior and junior mining companies are striving hard to keep up with the demand for the metal.</p>\n\n<p>As years go by, I believe copper is going to be really critical and will be a mainstay in a lot of industries. I know that a lot of companies are striving to meet the demand for this metal, but if it does not match the rate of the increase on demand for copper, the supply will likely be short and the prices will continue to increase.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/plin6t/the_demand_for_copper_against_the_copper_supply/","title":"The demand for copper against the copper supply","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"September 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-10T12:32:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-10 12:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"plin6t","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/plin6t/the_demand_for_copper_against_the_copper_supply/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/plin6t/the_demand_for_copper_against_the_copper_supply/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"JonDyna965","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JonDyna965","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"JonDyna965","score":329,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"銅の供給に対する銅の需要","the_new_excerpt":"現在の状況を見ると、銅の需要は今後も増え続けると思われます。\n銅の需要は今後も増え続けるでしょうから、銅の量を増やすか、他の経済的な代替手段を見つけない限り、価格も上昇していくと思います。\n銅の需要は増え続けると思います。\n\nそこで問題になるのが、需要に見合った供給ができるかどうかです。\n需要に見合った供給ができるかどうか。銅は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"对铜的需求与铜的供应","the_new_excerpt":"看到目前的情况，我坚信，对铜的需求将不断增加，所以价格也将不断上涨。\n的需求将继续上升，因此价格也将上升，除非我们找到更多的铜或其他经济替代品。\n其他经济替代品。\n\n这使我想到一个问题，即供应能否满足需求？\n需求的可能性。铜是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"對銅的需求與銅的供應","the_new_excerpt":"看到目前的情況，我堅信，對銅的需求將不斷增加，所以價格也將不斷上漲。\n的需求將繼續上升，因此價格也將上升，除非我們找到更多的銅或其他經濟替代品。\n其他經濟替代品。\n\n這使我想到一個問題，即供應能否滿足需求？\n需求的可能性。銅是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pl8qx7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pl8qx7/me_buying_all_the_dips/","title":"Me buying all the dips","date":"September 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ディップを買いまくる私","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我买了所有的蘸酱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我買了所有的蘸醬","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"TweetPost-1436174439947939842","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1436174439947939842","title":"FATHER SAYS SON DIED HOURS AFTER $JNJ VACCINE\n https://t.co/8nseMmmr5i","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 10, 2021","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"息子はJinjワクチン接種の数時間後に死亡したと語る父親\n https://t.co/8nseMmmr5i","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"父亲说儿子在接种JNJ疫苗后数小时死亡\n https://t.co/8nseMmmr5i","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"父親說兒子在接種JNJ疫苗後數小時死亡\n https://t.co/8nseMmmr5i","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-plin6t","previousId":"RedditPost-pl8qx7","nextId":"TweetPost-1436174439947939842","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/plin6t/the_demand_for_copper_against_the_copper_supply/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
