Lots of dynamics affecting the market right, with market participants closely monitoring developments out of Washington D.C, communications from the Fed, and ongoing situations in China. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield spiked to as much as 1.56%, the highest level since June, which pressured tech stocks, causing the Nasdaq (QQQ) to fall by more than 2.5% yesterday. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today&#39;s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.</p>\n\n<p>Timothy Chubb, Chief Investment Officer at advisory firm Girard, said “Yesterday’s selloff was really largely driven by rate movement. It wasn’t necessarily the size of the rate movement, but the speed that it took place.” The yield gained more than 16 basis points from its low last Friday to yesterday’s peak. </p>\n\n<p>Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning the US must raise the debt limit by October 18 in order to avoid a default. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-government-funding-e7bfe8a6ffdb40a8d33e17ef11ded7a7\">https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-government-funding-e7bfe8a6ffdb40a8d33e17ef11ded7a7</a></p>\n\n<p>Jason Grumet, Bipartisan Policy Center President, said “It is really important that we separate the shutdown, which is terrible, from the debt limit, which is catastrophic. There could be, I think, a very short shutdown of the government Friday night going into Saturday, Sunday. And I think that you would then see a short continuing resolution to get the government running again. The government shutdown really isn’t the problem we’re grappling with. The problem we&#39;re grappling with really is the debt ceiling. Democrats tried to join them together. That did not make the sale for Republicans. Some Democrats have a different approach to the debt ceiling. But I am not particularly concerned about a government shutdown.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Penduing home sales have greatly exceed expectations in August, rebounding spectacularly from the July dip to jump to the highest level in seven-months. Pending home sales rose 8.1% in August month-on-month, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/pending-home-sales-recover-8-1-in-august\">National Association of Realtors</a>. This exceeded estimates for a 1.4% monthly rise, based on Bloomberg consensus data. In July, pending home sales fell by 2.0%. Pending home sales are -6.3% down compared to last year.</p>\n\n<p>Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s Chief Economist, said “Rising inventory and moderating price conditions are bringing buyers back to the market. Affordability, however, remains challenging as home prices are roughly three times wage growth. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Google announced it was updating the look and format of its product search page to more resemble a digital store rather than a long list of links and texts. </li>\n<li>Netflix (NFLX) bought video game developer Night School Studios and rolled out five mobile gaming titles in select European markets yesterday, another push by the company into gaming.</li>\n<li>The German state of Brandenburg said on Wednesday no decision has been taken on Tesla&#39;s request to build a factory near Berlin, following a media report that regulators had agreed on the terms of a conditional approval.</li>\n<li>Lucid (LCID) said it plans to start delivering it’s luxury electric sedans with the highest range in the market in late October.
