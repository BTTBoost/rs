I am NOT a GME and AMC ape. To be honest, I hate that crowd and the way they approach investing. I am not an ambulance chaser jumping on struggling companies in hopes that some dumb reddit trend will make me a quick 10%.</p>\n\n<p>But that does not change the facts about what is going on right now. Enthusiast Gaming, the leading eSports organization in North America (<em>as measured social reach, web traffic and revenue</em>) is being shorted to death.</p>\n\n<p>After an epic, fundamentals driven rally from $1 to $8.80, the stock has been beaten down to $6.50.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s very important to note that <strong>the rally was not a senseless meme pump</strong>. The company&#39;s <strong>revenue grew from $15m per year to $127m</strong>. They also announced a litany of high profile fortune 500 and government clients that hired them. The company is not fluff.</p>\n\n<p>If the company is doing okay, then how come it&#39;s down so much? Well the catalyst that kicked off the downtrend was their announcement of share sales. As a newly registered Nasdaq company, they had to file forms with the SEC that would allow them to sell shares over the next 25 months. That process took a few weeks to complete before they could close a deal.</p>\n\n<p>During that time, the shorts have had their way with EGLX. You can see a detailed chart of shorting activity over the past several weeks here:  <a href=\"https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX\">https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX</a></p>\n\n<p>The company has a tiny little market cap and the stock volume has been relatively low. A small number of short sellers have been able to exercise extreme market power over this company.</p>\n\n<p>But now they have overstayed their welcome. They have raised the capital and the financials are sound. The company&#39;s actual business is doing great and the industry will continue booming.</p>\n\n<p>Every single morning since the deal closed, EGLX has tried pumping back up, and then it settles down. But the stock selling pressure is not coming from long term holders giving up their positions. It is coming from short sellers trying to make a quick buck at the expense of a great Canadian company.</p>\n\n<h1>According to this source, short interest was 38% yesterday.</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX\">https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX</a></p>\n\n<p>I am willing to bet the short interest will be even higher on Monday. The stock started popping off this morning and then fell precipitously again.</p>\n\n<p>But how do I know this company isn&#39;t just dog doodoo and shareholders are dumping?</p>\n\n<p>Look at the cost to borrow: <a href=\"https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx\">https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx</a></p>\n\n<h1>This shorting is costing the shorts 9%! Compare that to AMC&#39;s 1.16% and GME&#39;s 0.59% short borrowing cost.</h1>\n\n<p>Get wrecked.</p>\n\n<p>This high cost to borrow means a couple things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is an extremely high number of short sellers compared to people who are willing to lend out their shares. That indicates its over shorted and holders are hodling.</li>\n<li>It also means this is costing them ALOT every day this stock doesn&#39;t go down further.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, if this company was a steaming pile of trash that isn&#39;t making money, I would say the shorts will just kill EGLX and win the day. I do NOT advocate in investing in dying companies in hopes of some bogus short squeeze.</p>\n\n<p>But EGLX will not die. It is genuinely a great long term opportunity, and the bears have gotten ahead of themselves on this one. This company is here to stay, for a number of obvious reasons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reason 1: Common sense:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The eSports and gaming industry is growing and these guys have developed a real business out of it. They are doing business with: TikTok, Samsung, ATVI, EA, President Biden&#39;s Campaign, the US military, Ad Council, Disney, Bell, Nintendo etc etc. What&#39;s more, they are producing results for them. Take a scroll through the luminosity LGLoyal twitch page, and you can see that EGLX has been getting about a million views on every single video with the program they developed with TikTok. TikTok has already indicated they intend to continue to do business with EGLX.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reason 2: They have cash:</strong></p>\n\n<p>They just successfully raised another $44m in cash. Looking at their recent financials, I think that probably puts them around $60m cash in the bank right now. They are not going to run out of liquidity. They are not some business on the verge of bankruptcy, desperate for funding and debt.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reason 3: They are NOT overpriced:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In a market where most high volatility growth names like say Palantir, Zoom, BB, Score, Tesla, Dkng etc are all trading at like a 10-50X price to sales ratio, EGLX is sitting at a measly 6.5 price to sales. That is a tad high when you compare it to stable value stocks in the Berkshire portfolio, but honestly it&#39;s PEANUTS for a growth stock in a hot industry that just expanded their revenue ten fold.</p>\n\n<h1>This stock will rubber band back to $10 when these shorts give up.</h1>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o2v34l/eglx_leading_esports_company_is_way_over_shorted/","title":"EGLX - leading eSports company is way over shorted","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"June 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-19T04:43:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-19 04:43","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"5fc584e1-6dbd-55f1-a49c-78f81b7776ca","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o2v34l/eglx_leading_esports_company_is_way_over_shorted/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o2v34l/eglx_leading_esports_company_is_way_over_shorted/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Troflecopter","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Troflecopter","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Troflecopter","score":42,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"EGLX - eSportsをリードする企業は、空売りされすぎています。","the_new_excerpt":"まず、はっきりさせておきたいことがあります。私はGMEとAMCの猿真似ではありません。正直に言うと、私はあの連中や\n彼らの投資への取り組み方が嫌いなのです。私は、レッドディッツのような馬鹿な人たちに期待して、苦境にある企業に飛びつく救急車の追跡者ではありません。\n苦しんでいる企業に飛びつく救急隊員でもありませんし、レッドディットのくだらないトレンドが私に素早く10％の利益をもたらすことを期待しています。\n10％を手っ取り早く稼げることを期待して、苦境にある企業に飛びつく救急隊員ではない。\n\nしかし、それは何が起こっているかについての事実を変えることはできません...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"EGLX--领先的电子竞技公司被过度做空","the_new_excerpt":"首先，让我说清楚。我不是一个GME和AMC的猿人。说实话，我讨厌那些\n人群和他们对待投资的方式。我不是一个追逐救护车的人。\n挣扎的公司，希望一些愚蠢的reddit趋势能让我快速赚到\n快10%。\n\n但这并不能改变正在发生的事实...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"EGLX--領先的電子競技公司被過度做空","the_new_excerpt":"首先，讓我說清楚。我不是一個GME和AMC的猿人。說實話，我討厭那些\n人羣和他們對待投資的方式。我不是一個追逐救護車的人。\n掙扎的公司，希望一些愚蠢的reddit趨勢能讓我快速賺到\n快10%。\n\n但這並不能改變正在發生的事實...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-7249846f-54e9-50d5-81cc-b60709f0a916","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/o345p3/how_much_in_stocks_jacks_answer_from_the_little/","title":"\"How much in stocks?\" Jack's answer from The Little Book of Common Sense Investing","date":"June 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"\"株はどれくらい？\" ジャックの答え（『The Little Book of Common Sense Investing』より","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"\"多少钱的股票？\" 杰克的答案来自《投资常识小书》。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"\"多少錢的股票？\" 傑克的答案來自《投資常識小書》。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-8cccf3d3-9790-5165-89eb-f3c0f8a1959c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2wj7t/usually_i_dont_buy_options_but_when_i_do_i_make/","title":"Usually I don’t buy options.. but when I do I make sure to lose them all","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"June 19, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"普段はオプションを買わないのですが、買うときは必ず全部なくします。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"通常我不买期权......但当我买的时候，我一定要把它们全部丢掉。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"通常我不買期權......但當我買的時候，我一定要把它們全部丟掉。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-5fc584e1-6dbd-55f1-a49c-78f81b7776ca","previousId":"RedditPost-7249846f-54e9-50d5-81cc-b60709f0a916","nextId":"RedditPost-8cccf3d3-9790-5165-89eb-f3c0f8a1959c","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/o2v34l/eglx_leading_esports_company_is_way_over_shorted/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
