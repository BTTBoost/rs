The two companies will deepen cooperation in charging and battery swap infrastructure construction. Under the deal, Nio will build charging stations and battery swap stations in some malls of Metro China.  </p>\n\n<p>Metro AG entered the Chinese market in 1996, according to the company’s <a href=\"https://www.metro.cn/en/about-metro/mcc-cn\">China website</a>. To date, the company has opened 97 shopping malls in China, employing more than 11,000 people and serving 17 million customers.  </p>\n\n<p>Nio is relying on service offerings to make an impact on customers in China. Battery-swapping provides the advantage of saving on time as opposed to charging, and Nio is one of the proponents of this concept. In comparison, Nio rival <strong>Tesla Inc.</strong> <a href=\"https://benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a> is a big fan of <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/tech/21/03/19921897/tesla-says-no-to-swap-batteries-and-rumors-yes-to-fast-charging-for-evs\">battery charging</a> rather than swapping.  </p>\n\n<p>Nio <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/01/19088720/nio-day-2020-ev-maker-shows-off-et7-sedan-new-power-swap-station-150kwh-battery-pack-adaas-and-more\">unveiled</a> its next-gen power swapping stations at the Nio Day in January this year. The power swapping station can accommodate 13 batteries and has a daily capacity of up to 312 swaps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/20395154/nio-looks-to-expand-ev-charging-infrastructure-in-partnership-with-germanys-metro\">NIO Inc.
