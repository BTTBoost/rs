The company announced Q1 earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while competitors are lagged.</p>\n\n<p>During   the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on   the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.</p>\n\n<p>Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:</p>\n\n<p>The    Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid   on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. <strong>We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>And    so you guys know how we&#39;re thinking about this. Our balance sheet  is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and   we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think about   this   going forward is we&#39;re producing a lot of cash. We&#39;re going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very successful in   2021.   And <strong>if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back</strong>. And whether we have to <strong>change    the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,    those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>May Q1 Earnings Quote:</p>\n\n<p>As    you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of     $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a     record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  <strong>explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program</strong>. As you guys have seen, we <strong>concluded     share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward  shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share  buyback over the    next 24 months</strong>.  And <strong>quite honestly, with where the share price is, it&#39;s a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Then in answering a question from an analyst</p>\n\n<p>Doug   Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you   mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about   kind of <strong>how much of  the float  you&#39;d be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I&#39;m learning these rules as we go <strong>because at this stock  price, I&#39;m a buyer, right</strong>?   And so we&#39;ll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal   teams say we&#39;re allowed to do. And so I don&#39;t know  how many I can buy   and what I can do, but I&#39;m very conscientious of the  float.  If the   float was not a concern, <strong>we&#39;d be more aggressive</strong>. However,  <strong>we    have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I&#39;m     going to take advantage of that opportunity while being conscientious     of our partners in the float.</strong></p>\n\n<p>TL/DR:    UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to    shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a    buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they    can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that  it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he&#39;s going to take FULL advantage. At current    stock price levels the CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are not   waiting, it&#39;s being deployed now.</p>\n\n<p>Disclosure I am still in long position with 23K shares of UWMC</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/nb8ht6/mat_ishbia_called_out_in_feb_q4_earnings_that_he/","title":"Mat Ishbia called out in Feb Q4 earnings that he wanted to payback shareholders.
