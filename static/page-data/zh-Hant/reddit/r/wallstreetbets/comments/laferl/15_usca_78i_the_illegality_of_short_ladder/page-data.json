The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.gyazo.com/d33d2d9346092b3c041c54fc394225c3.png\">https://i.gyazo.com/d33d2d9346092b3c041c54fc394225c3.png</a></p>\n\n<p>(Check this from the huge dip last Thursday. No volume but still an enormous dip in price)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33\">https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/</a></p>\n\n<p>check this out</p>\n\n<p>Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that &quot;Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, <strong>shall</strong> be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n\n<p>Your Average Retail Investor</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Feel free to copy, share, do whatever with this. I really don’t care. My work is worthless unless something is actually done to stop this. Also, thank your for the awards 💎🙌</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: if you want to copy this, go ahead, if you’re having trouble, dm me and I’ll send it to you directly</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: There was a suggestion to post this on Twitter. Whoever wants to can go ahead or dm me if you need to make it smaller. 🙏</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: So, I have sent this to the SEC, but I expect nothing more than a form letter, which is basically a garbage non-answer (Google it). I’d rather this get some media coverage so feel free to spam this on Twitter or w/e.
