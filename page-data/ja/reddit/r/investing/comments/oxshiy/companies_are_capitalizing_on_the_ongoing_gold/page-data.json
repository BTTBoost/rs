The gold market has brought a more diverse set of consumers and investors, which make it a picture of diversity and constant growth.</p>\n\n<p>The demand for gold has been driven not only by cultural changes, but also by the income growth in some of the world’s most dynamic and rapidly growing economies. This brings me to the observation that gold seems to be on the roll, since I always encounter gold stocks trends in a lot of subreddits that I come across.</p>\n\n<p>Big companies like Newmont Corporation (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NEM/\">NEM</a>) basically have the largest gold reserve base in the industry. Their gold mines include Nevada, Colorado, Ontario, Quebec, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Ghana, Argentina, Peru, and Suriname.</p>\n\n<p>They acquired GT Gold too, which only improved their portfolio significantly, since GT Gold has the Tatogga project in the highly sought after Golden Triangle District of British Columbia, Canada. They recently enhanced their portfolio with the approval of the Ahafo North Project in Ghana.</p>\n\n<p>There are junior players out there that are showing promise as well. Take Collective Mining (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNL.V/\">CNL</a>) for example, who has been working on potentially valuable gold projects. They are more than ready to capitalize on the trend with their Guayabales and San Antonio projects all found in Colombia. In fact, they recently discovered a high grade silver channel sampling at the Box Target.</p>\n\n<p>The company also had another development a few weeks back, with their initial channel sampling campaign at the Donut target (“Donut”) within the Guayabales Project has returned high-grade gold and silver assay results from a shallow underground tunnel.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing how gold mining companies are taking advantage of the trend in gold stocks, I think we can expect more people investing I guess. Tons of stock threads are all over reddit, so it seems like people have been really trying to take advantage and make sure they get some good earnings from it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oxshiy/companies_are_capitalizing_on_the_ongoing_gold/","title":"Companies are capitalizing on the ongoing gold trend","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-04T14:20:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-04 14:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"323073c9-d94b-5e66-be3a-ae2f31c691b8","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oxshiy/companies_are_capitalizing_on_the_ongoing_gold/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oxshiy/companies_are_capitalizing_on_the_ongoing_gold/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"pizazzessteampipex4","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/pizazzessteampipex4","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"pizazzessteampipex4","score":230,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"金のトレンドに乗っている企業","the_new_excerpt":"進化する金の需要に対応するため、企業は間違いなく迅速に動いている\nを手に入れようとしています。金市場では、消費者や投資家がより多様化しています。\n金市場は、より多様な消費者と投資家をもたらし、それは多様性と絶え間ない成長を絵に描いたようなものです。\n\n金の需要は、文化の変化だけでなく、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"公司正在利用持续的黄金趋势","the_new_excerpt":"随着黄金需求的不断变化，公司肯定在快速行动以获得\n他们的手。黄金市场带来了更加多样化的消费者\n和投资者，这使它成为一幅多元化和不断增长的画面。\n\n对黄金的需求不仅受到文化变化的推动，而且...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"公司正在利用持續的黃金趨勢","the_new_excerpt":"隨着黃金需求的不斷變化，公司肯定在快速行動以獲得\n他們的手。黃金市場帶來了更加多樣化的消費者\n和投資者，這使它成爲一幅多元化和不斷增長的畫面。\n\n對黃金的需求不僅受到文化變化的推動，而且...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-e27d94f5-8692-5264-91d6-33229a464902","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxqcpg/my_experience_trading_with_robinhood_this_past/","title":"My experience trading with Robinhood this past year","date":"August 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"この1年のRobinhoodでの取引経験","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"过去一年我在Robinhood的交易经验","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"過去一年我在Robinhood的交易經驗","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e7cfb47a-7aea-5d98-bc74-9275e7acee95","excerpt":"You may have seen my previous post, but I’m helping my 24 year old sister set up\na Roth IRA as her company does not offer a 401k.
