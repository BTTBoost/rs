This is not direct financial advice...but still advice for dealing with investing.)</p>\n\n<p>I am completely floored by the amount of people who have NO BUSINESS independently jumping into the stock market, diving into the deep end and not knowing how to swim.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Never invest what you&#39;re not willing to lose.  Do not pump every dime to your name into an investment.  This is almost a surefire path to failure.  If you invest in a stock, or a fund, only do so if the money you&#39;re investing will not be detrimental or catastrophic to your existence if lost.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you&#39;re new to investing, get a broker while you also do your DD (due diligence) researching companies you&#39;re considering investing in.</p></li>\n<li><p>Learn market terms such as &quot;long&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, &quot;bullish&quot;, &quot;bearish&quot;, &quot;futures&quot;, etc.  And then learn the different ways to incorporate and utilize these terms.  That way you&#39;re not just limited to &quot;buying/selling&quot;.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you insist on doing it yourself, do not purchase stock in a company without researching the company.  Their executives, business model, earnings, stock trend for at least 2 years (if available), etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>Learn about moderate to high yield ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and Index Funds.  Typically between 3-8% dividend yield is a great middle ground depending on the overall performance of the fund.</p></li>\n<li><p>This is one of the most important quotes, in my opinion, when it comes to investing:  &quot;If you&#39;re not willing to own a stock for at least 10 years, don&#39;t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.&quot; -Warren Buffett </p></li>\n<li><p>Learn the 4% rule!  Learn the 4% rule!!  Learn the 4% rule!!!</p></li>\n<li><p>Understand the formula for figuring out how much money you would need invested into annual return yield to account for your current annual income.  If you learn this, it will give you greater insight, a more clear, concise target, and a simpler goal.</p></li>\n<li><p>Find a mentor.  Trust me, you very likely know at least one person who is good with investing, and these people generally enjoy passing this knowledge on to others.  If you don&#39;t...FIND A BROKER!</p></li>\n<li><p>Do NOT jump on trends, fads, or bandwagons...you&#39;ll typically be left holding the bag because you didn&#39;t know any better, and you will simply watch those that did know make money and then bail.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lbjgjw/its_amazing_how_many_people_jumped_in_headfirst/","title":"It's amazing how many people jumped in headfirst that have no business investing.
