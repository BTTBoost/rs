I’ve also analyzed other companies, so feel free to check out my profile for other stock analysis! </p>\n\n<p>For those that don’t know, Palantir is a software company that specializes in big data analytics. At the time of this post, they’re sitting at about $23.33. They reported earnings for Quarter 3 on November 9th, 2021. Revenue was reported to be $392 million, which is up 35.5% from the same quarter last year, beating expectations by $5.54 million. Furthemore, in Q3 they added 34 new customers and closed 54 deals worth at least $1 million, 33 of which were at least $5 million, and 18 of which were worth at least $10 Million. For Q4, Palantir is expecting $418 Million in revenue, consensus is $401.87 Million. The CEO of PLTR, Alex Karp, said that they expect revenue to grow at a rate of 30% or more for 2021 - 2025. Now let’s discuss their valuation...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Since Palantir had a larger number of customers and government deals in Q3, they reported stronger revenue growth, However, growth did lag in comparison to other competitors who are in the same space such as Datadog and Snowflake. </li>\n<li>Palantir demonstrated the highest value for EBITDA margins compared to other companies in the space. Adjusted free cash flow for quarter 3 was $119 Million, which was a $172 million improvement year-over-year, representing a margin of about 30%. </li>\n<li>Despite the fact that this company looks like it’s trading at a cheap price compared to its peers, it is trading at 17 to 20x revenue multiples which means that if they happen to have a bad quarter, the stock can drop hard. However, keep in mind that they do seem to be executing pretty well since they’ve been growing the amount of deals they’ve been making with organizations and firms, Have strong revenue growth, and also have good EBITDA margins. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of this being said, Palantir may be a buy only if you believe in the company long-term. In order for Palantir to succeed, they will need to grow their commercial product offering, since they already have a good presence on the government side. Things do seem to be going well on that end though because the commercial side growth has been going up as of recently. In my opinion, this company is still trading at too high of a price, your money would be better off invested in a different tech company.

I’d also love to hear your comments!</p>\n\n<p>EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Debt, Amortization</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/quqjjj/i_analyzed_pltr_so_you_dont_have_to/","title":"I Analyzed $PLTR So You Don't Have To","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-16T01:14:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-16 01:14","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"quqjjj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/quqjjj/i_analyzed_pltr_so_you_dont_have_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/quqjjj/i_analyzed_pltr_so_you_dont_have_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Jodyhighrolex","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jodyhighrolex","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Jodyhighrolex","score":113,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私が$PLTRを分析したので、あなたはその必要はありません。","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。私は多くの人が$PLTRについて話しているのを見てきたので、今日は\n今日は$PLTR、別名Palantirを分析することにしました。他の企業の分析もしています。\n他の企業の分析もしていますので、私のプロフィールで他の銘柄の分析もチェックしてください。\n\nご存知ない方もいるかもしれませんが、Palantirはソフトウェア会社で、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我分析了$PLTR，所以你不必去分析。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我一直看到很多人在谈论$PLTR，所以今天我\n决定分析一下$PLTR，也就是Palantir。我还分析了其他\n公司，所以请随时查看我的个人资料，了解其他的股票分析!\n\n对于那些不知道的人来说，Palantir是一家软件公司，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我分析了$PLTR，所以你不必去分析。","the_new_excerpt":"大家好，我一直看到很多人在談論$PLTR，所以今天我\n決定分析一下$PLTR，也就是Palantir。我還分析了其他\n公司，所以請隨時查看我的個人資料，瞭解其他的股票分析!\n\n對於那些不知道的人來說，Palantir是一家軟件公司，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-quqg52","excerpt":"Customer reservations rose to 13,000 in Q3, reflecting an order book of\napproximately $1.3B, and have since increased beyond 17,000\n\n * Lucid Air today won the 2022 MotorTrend Car of the Year\n\n * Customer vehicle production started in Q3 at Lucid's Advanced Manufacturing\n   Plant (\"AMP-1\") in Casa…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/quqg52/lucid_releases_q3_results_with_13000_reservations/","title":"Lucid releases Q3 results with 13,000 reservations","date":"November 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ルシード、13,000件の予約で第3四半期決算を発表","the_new_excerpt":"第3四半期の顧客予約数は13,000件に上り、約1,000万ドルの受注を反映しています。\nその後、17,000件を超えています。\n\n * Lucid Airは本日、2022 MotorTrend Car of the Yearを受賞しました。\n\n * Lucid Airは本日、2022年のMotorTrend Car of the Yearを受賞しました。\n   ルシードの先進製造工場（AMP-1）では、第3四半期に顧客車両の生産を開始しました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Lucid发布第三季度业绩，预订量为13,000个","the_new_excerpt":"第三季度的客户预订量上升至13,000个，反映出订单量约为1,000个。\n约13亿美元，此后又增加到17,000个以上。\n\n * Lucid Air今天赢得了2022年MotorTrend年度汽车大奖。\n\n *客户车辆在第三季度开始在Lucid的先进制造工厂生产。\n   客户车辆的生产于第三季度在Lucid位于卡萨的先进制造厂（\"AMP-1\"）开始。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Lucid發佈第三季度業績，預訂量爲13,000個","the_new_excerpt":"第三季度的客戶預訂量上升至13,000個，反映出訂單量約爲1,000個。\n約13億美元，此後又增加到17,000個以上。\n\n * Lucid Air今天贏得了2022年MotorTrend年度汽車大獎。\n\n *客戶車輛在第三季度開始在Lucid的先進製造工廠生產。\n   客戶車輛的生產於第三季度在Lucid位於卡薩的先進製造廠（\"AMP-1\"）開始。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qurk7o","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qurk7o/how_much_is_enough/","title":"How much is enough?!?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 16, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"どれだけあればいいんだ！？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"多少才算够？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"多少纔算夠？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-quqjjj","previousId":"RedditPost-quqg52","nextId":"RedditPost-qurk7o","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/quqjjj/i_analyzed_pltr_so_you_dont_have_to/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
