Not a huge TSLA fan here...</p>\n\n<p><strong>But ....let&#39;s assume TSLA is fairly valued.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Current market cap:</p>\n\n<p>$TSLA: 1T</p>\n\n<p>$RIVN: 127B</p>\n\n<p>ratio of market cap: 7.8</p>\n\n<p>I am not going to judge RIVN on current (near zero) revenue. Let&#39;s look at 2 years out and 9 years out.</p>\n\n<p>A conservative forecast is that $TSLA can add <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/09/tesla-growth-in-the-next-two-years-2022-2023/\">1.21M</a> vehicles to its yearly production. This is based on actual plants in/soon-to-be in production. Assuming 2021Q4 will grow at 15% over 2021Q3 (same growth from Q2 to Q3), TSLA would have produced 900M vehicles this year.</p>\n\n<p>TSLA 2021: 900M</p>\n\n<p><strong>TSLA 2023: 2.11M</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TSLA 2030: Elon projects 20M</strong>. This can be super optimistic, I will get back to it soon.</p>\n\n<p>Demand for TSLA? TSLA does not have a demand issue as Elon. For example, currently TSLA is the second largest EV in *CHINA*.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s Look at RIVIAN ($RIVN) production forecast according to its own CEO, however ambitious and optimistic:</p>\n\n<p>RIVN 2023: <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/\">CEO projects 200K</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>RIVN 2030:</strong> <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/\"><strong>CEO projects at least 1M</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Car production:</strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Whether in 2023 or 2030, TSLA will produce at least 10X as RIVN. I say at least because TSLA can prove based on current plans capacity it can deliver 2.1M in 2023, RIVN CEO cannot really prove that, but let&#39;s take his work.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><strong>Demand</strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Much hype has been made about RIVN because F and AMZN invested in it. And AMZN has committed to purchase 100K vehicles over the next 5 years. Let&#39;s put things into perspective: <strong>TSLA has proved its popularity in CHINA, EUROPE, and US vs. RIVN has a contract with AMZN.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Some misunderstanding by retail investors about RIVN:</strong> Just because F and AMZN backed RIVN does not mean they will be giving RIVN free money OK?  IF that guarantees that RIVN can finance with future rounds (good thing), this will dilute your shares</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><strong>Other production</strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unlike TSLA, RIVN is ONLY a car company. TSLA produces solar, batteries, software, soon Lithium, + has proven it can navigate through shortages</strong></li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><strong>Management:</strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I think we all agree - even TSLA haters - that Elon is one of the smartest most innovative, most ambitious visionary with a long track record of success after success. We know nothing about Scaringe. He is definitely a smart guy, but it would be extremely extremely optimistic to think he can one up Elon on innovation.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally we can talk about returns on your investment.</strong></p>\n\n<p>RIVN remains largely pre-revenue, it has not proven itself yet. Therefore investors RIVN which is more risky play, needs to deliver higher returns than TSLA. <strong>No one would invest in a pre-revenue company if its expected return on investment does not exceed  more mature companies.</strong> Would you invest in TSLA if the returns on its stock is not going to exceed that of KO?</p>\n\n<p>In 2030 TSLA/RIVN Car production only <strong>= 20x.</strong> Let&#39;s say Elon is too optimistic about 2030 and Scaringe is conservative, <strong>let&#39;s say it is 15X</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Currently the market cap is only 7.8 X half of production ratio.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This means that even if TSLA&#39;s non-car production (solar, software, chips, etc) does not materialize and is equal to zero (against all evidence) ...</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR/CONCLUSION:</strong></p>\n\n<p>At fair valuation in 2030 <strong>with extremely generous assumption to RIVN</strong> compared to TSLA <strong>the returns on your RIVN investment will be HALF of that of TSLA</strong>.. (1+x)=2*(1+y)</p>\n\n<p><strong>If the return on your TSLA stock is 100% ===&gt; $RVN will be 0%</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>If the return on your TSLA stock is 50% ===&gt; $RVN will be -25%</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>If the return on your TSLA stock is 0% ===&gt; $RVN will be -50%</strong></p>\n\n<p>IF TSLA crashes by 30% as some TSLA skeptics such as me believe it is possible, RIVN will have to crash by 65%</p>\n\n<p>Again, this is under the assumption that TSLA (like RIVN) is only a car company and that RIVN will meet and exceed its goals in comparison to TSLA.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would you invest in a pre-revenue company with lower returns than a mature company?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For more analysis like this you can follow me on twitter: at TCPresearch ... I will be soon revealing a couple of companies that are garbage which are under the radar. I also retweet the most actionable investment insights I see.</p>\n\n<p>Happy investing everyone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qtal6i/rivian_vs_tesla_sanity_check_back_of_the_envelope/","title":"Rivian vs Tesla sanity check: back of the envelope calculation","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-14T05:08:51.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-14 05:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qtal6i","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qtal6i/rivian_vs_tesla_sanity_check_back_of_the_envelope/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qtal6i/rivian_vs_tesla_sanity_check_back_of_the_envelope/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"listenless","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/listenless","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"listenless","score":41,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"リヴィアン対テスラのサニティチェック：バックオブエンベロープ計算","the_new_excerpt":"私は今、covidでダウンしているので、この記事は短くて甘いものになるでしょう（Fatigue is a b***c）。\n\n多くの人が主張するように、$TSLAは史上最も過大評価されたメガキャップの一つではないと仮定しましょう。\n多くの人が主張しているように、$TSLAは史上最も過大評価されたメガキャップの一つではないと仮定しましょう。ここではTSLAの大ファンではありませんが...。\n\nしかし、....、TSLAが正当に評価されていると仮定してみましょう。\n\n現在の市場...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"里维安与特斯拉的理智检查：信封式计算","the_new_excerpt":"这将是简短而温馨的，因为我现在得了covid（疲劳是一个b***c）。\n\n让我们假设TSLA不是像许多人所说的那样是有史以来被高估的巨型股票之一。\n争论，我同意它被高估了很多。我不是TSLA的超级粉丝...\n\n但....，我们假设TSLA的价值是公平的。\n\n目前的市场...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"裏維安與特斯拉的理智檢查：信封式計算","the_new_excerpt":"這將是簡短而溫馨的，因爲我現在得了covid（疲勞是一個b***c）。\n\n讓我們假設TSLA不是像許多人所說的那樣是有史以來被高估的巨型股票之一。\n爭論，我同意它被高估了很多。我不是TSLA的超級粉絲...\n\n但....，我們假設TSLA的價值是公平的。\n\n目前的市場...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qtee3g","excerpt":"I respect their product, but their entire business is a complete dumpster fire.\nBeyond is victim of investor pressure for profits over developing research and\nlong-term growth.\n\n 1.
