For a company to redeem shares, it must have stipulated upfront that those shares are redeemable, or callable. ... Shareholders are obligated to sell the stock in a redemption.</p>\n\n<p>Short Interest: Short interest is <strong>the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out</strong>. Short interest, which can be expressed as a number or percentage, is an indicator of market sentiment. Extremely high short interest shows investors are very pessimistic (potentially overly-pessimistic).</p>\n\n<p>Gamma Squeeze: The gamma squeeze happens <strong>when the underlying stock&#39;s price begins to go up very quickly within a short period of time</strong>. As more money flows into call options from investors, that forces more buying activity which can lead to higher stock prices.</p>\n\n<p>Public Float: Also known as public equity float. <strong>The portion of a company&#39;s outstanding shares that is in the hands of public investors</strong>, as opposed to company officers, directors, or stockholders that hold controlling interests. These are the shares that are available for trading.</p>\n\n<p>With that out the way, lets dive into why $IRNT and $OPAD is so unique and why this play is so rare.</p>\n\n<p>Both $IRNT and $OPAD have had a stock redemption. Not a small redemption but a fucking massive redemption. $OPAD for example has around 92% of the public float that’s redeemed.</p>\n\n<p>What’s being shown as “Public Float” on a lot of stock analytics websites is not the actual public float of $IRNT and $OPAD.</p>\n\n<p>The number of shares that have been redeemed has reduced the current public float of $IRNT to 1.3M and $OPAD to 3.4M. A lot of post already explain the $IRNT redemption, but for $OPAD you can view this redditors post who explains it perfectly. The 8-k and definitive proxy agreement are hyperlinked in his post. So, I wont go into details on my post about the public float as it’s already been written here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/pjn5rw/opad_the_despac_madness_continues/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/pjn5rw/opad_the_despac_madness_continues/</a></p>\n\n<p>Now, with all this information what does this mean?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cwm8315r3yn71.png?width=2523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c66c71d744939897af61b916b1a823dca320848\">$IRNT</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wi6jl06t3yn71.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6824257eba4ddd5f5c022661e875a166c12e9f\">$OPAD</a></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, 764.21k is shorted for $IRNT. 764.21k /1.3M = 58% SI%.</p>\n\n<p>$OPAD has 3.72M shorted. The actual float after redemption is 3.4M. 3.72M/3.4M = 109% SI%.</p>\n\n<p>Just to clarify with everyone, these short interest percentages are on the low end. The actual float is anticipated to be shorted by a lot more than just these simple calculations, but this is easy math you can calculate on the open lagged data on the inter-web.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s look at the Option Chain. Before I jump into that, let me explain something very important, 1 contract = 100 share. If an option contract is in the money, the holder of that contract must exercise their contract, if they do nothing and the contract expires, the broker will exercise that contract on their behalf. So, for every call option written that’s in the money, those contracts will be exercised.</p>\n\n<p>With that being said, look at the options contract for both of these stocks. Look at the open interest on the call options.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, $20, $25, $30, 31, $35, $37, &amp; fucking $40! For $IRNT and $15, $17.50, $20, &amp; fucking $25 for $OPAD.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i6n9p44w3yn71.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e13c934ca372ef9e68339b4b4c7a1b32f619ea60\">$IRNT</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9n0oa1ux3yn71.png?width=1780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43013db7d88ee6662cfdd363d6929bd09f82b57c\">$OPAD</a></p>\n\n<p>Quick mafs = MM &amp; SHF are seriously fucked.</p>\n\n<p>Stop stressing out, yes, this is a high-risk trade, but an extremely unique, rare, and with solid probability that this will turn into exactly how we all think it’s going to turn out.</p>\n\n<p>This is in fact a very high risk to high reward trade. As always, trade at your own risk. But for those who really wanted to see the full-blown potential here, I hope this helped.</p>\n\n<p>This can very well turn out to be far larger then we can imagine. If a perfect setup was to occur the equation would look like this.</p>\n\n<p>Small Float + High SI% + High OI% + About to expire ITM = Bananas ... well guess what two stocks have this equation completed?</p>\n\n<p>I’ll see you in Valhalla ladies and gents.</p>\n\n<p>Mods, for the love of trading, don’t remove my post.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR – You need to read the whole thing. No short cuts to this one.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppo5hq/chill_the_fuck_out_and_read_this_irnt_opad/","title":"Chill the fuck out and read this. $IRNT & $OPAD","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"September 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-17T04:53:41.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-17 04:53","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ppo5hq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppo5hq/chill_the_fuck_out_and_read_this_irnt_opad/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppo5hq/chill_the_fuck_out_and_read_this_irnt_opad/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"ShortChecker","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShortChecker","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"ShortChecker","score":2179,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"冷静になって読んでみてください。$IRNT & $OPAD","the_new_excerpt":"ディゲンの仲間たち。\n\n冷静になって読んでみてください。\n\nIRNTと$OPADのユニークな状況は、まさにその通りで、極めてユニークです。\n\n要約してみよう。\n\n株の償還です。償還とは、会社が株主に株式の一部を会社に売り戻すことを要求することです。\n株式償還：株式償還とは、企業が株主に対して、保有する株式の一部を企業に売却するよう求めることです。会社が株式を償還するには、...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"寒心了，看看这个。尹恩惠和OPAD","the_new_excerpt":"同学们。\n\n冷静一下，读一读。\n\nIRNT美元和OPAD美元的独特情况，正是如此，极其独特。\n\n让我总结一下。\n\n股票赎回。赎回是指公司要求股东出售他们的一部分股票\n赎回：赎回是指公司要求股东将其部分股份卖回给公司。对于一个公司来说，要赎回股票，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"寒心了，看看這個。尹恩惠和OPAD","the_new_excerpt":"同學們。\n\n冷靜一下，讀一讀。\n\nIRNT美元和OPAD美元的獨特情況，正是如此，極其獨特。\n\n讓我總結一下。\n\n股票贖回。贖回是指公司要求股東出售他們的一部分股票\n贖回：贖回是指公司要求股東將其部分股份賣回給公司。對於一個公司來說，要贖回股票，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ppr6w1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppr6w1/i_joined_wsb_not_too_long_ago_and_poured_all_my/","title":"I joined WSB not too long ago and poured all my life savings, happy to say now my retirement is taken care of!","date":"September 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"少し前にWSBに加入し、貯めていたお金を全て注ぎ込みましたが、嬉しいことに今では老後の生活は万全です。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我不久前加入了WSB，倾注了我一生的积蓄，很高兴地说，现在我的退休生活得到了照顾！\"。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我不久前加入了WSB，傾注了我一生的積蓄，很高興地說，現在我的退休生活得到了照顧！\"。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ppmyal","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppmyal/now_you_know/","title":"Now you know.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 17, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"これでわかったでしょう。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"现在你知道了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"現在你知道了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ppo5hq","previousId":"RedditPost-ppr6w1","nextId":"RedditPost-ppmyal","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppo5hq/chill_the_fuck_out_and_read_this_irnt_opad/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
