I’m planning to go with <a href=\"http://www.barrick.com/English/home/default.aspx\">Barrick Gold Corp</a> (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/companies/ABX.TO\">ABX.TO</a>). They are showing good performance as their total preliminary gold production <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/barrick-third-quarter-gold-output-rises-nearly-5-sequentially-2021-10-14/\">rose to 1.09 million ounces</a>, from 1.04 million ounces in the previous quarter. It’s a nearly 5% rise in third-quarter gold production from the previous three months.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.firstmajestic.com/\">First Majestic Silver</a> (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/companies/AG\">AG</a>) is a primary silver-gold producer with three producing mines in Mexico, and one in Nevada. In 2021, production is estimated to fall between 25.7 and 27.5 million silver equivalent ounces, with costs falling between $17.86 and $18.63/oz.</p>\n\n<p>Looking into <a href=\"https://collectivemining.com/\">Collective Mining</a> (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/companies/CNL.V\">CNL.V</a>) as well, a company based in Caldas, Colombia. It’s interesting that the people behind them is the team of former executives from Continental Gold and were responsible for the discovery and construction of the Buriticá Gold mine, the biggest gold mine in Colombia. They’re showing good drilling results and recently started <a href=\"https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/2991-tsx-venture/cnl/107795-collective-mining-announces-the-initiation-of-drilling-at-the-box-target-a-large-and-mineralized-outcropping-gold-rich-porphyry-system.html\">drilling</a> more holes in their box target.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a load of gold stocks, I know. The bigger ones are much safer and secure but junior miners have the possibility to bring better rewards despite the risks behind it. Is it smart to buy when there’s a dip in the prices? There are some people telling me that it’s okay and is a good idea but I don’t know if I’m doing it right. There are also some coaxing me to go for physical gold. Haven’t let go of my money though so I need some advice</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/q8le51/investing_in_gold_mining_stocks_after_the_recent/","title":"Investing in gold mining stocks after the recent gold price dip","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"October 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-10-15T12:46:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-10-15 12:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"q8le51","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q8le51/investing_in_gold_mining_stocks_after_the_recent/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q8le51/investing_in_gold_mining_stocks_after_the_recent/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"KeithaSteuck","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/KeithaSteuck","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"KeithaSteuck","score":367,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"最近の金価格下落後の金鉱株への投資について","the_new_excerpt":"最近、金が急落しているので、ここ数週間調べていた金の銘柄を買おうと考えています。\nこの数週間、調べていた金の銘柄を買おうと思っています。私は、Barrick\nGold Corp [http://www.barrick.com/English/home/default.aspx] (ABX.TO\n[https://www.reuters.com/companies/ABX.TO]）です。) 彼らは良好な結果を示しています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"近期金价下跌后投资金矿股","the_new_excerpt":"最近黄金下跌，我在考虑去买一些黄金股票，这些股票是我过去几周一直在关注的。\n过去几周我一直在研究。我打算选择巴里克\n黄金公司[http://www.barrick.com/English/home/default.aspx]（ABX.TO\n[https://www.reuters.com/companies/ABX.TO]）。) 他们展示了良好的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"近期金價下跌後投資金礦股","the_new_excerpt":"最近黃金下跌，我在考慮去買一些黃金股票，這些股票是我過去幾週一直在關注的。\n過去幾周我一直在研究。我打算選擇巴里克\n黃金公司[http://www.barrick.com/English/home/default.aspx]（ABX.TO\n[https://www.reuters.com/companies/ABX.TO]）。) 他們展示了良好的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-q83q7z","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q83q7z/in_honor_of_cloudflare_crossing_10x_from_ipo_15/","title":"In honor of Cloudflare crossing 10x from IPO ($15 - $165) - some NET big boy gains.","date":"October 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CloudflareがIPOから10倍を超えたことを記念して（15ドル～165ドル）、いくつかのNETビッグボーイの利益を紹介します。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"为纪念Cloudflare从IPO（15美元-165美元）跨越10倍--一些NET大男孩的收益。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲紀念Cloudflare從IPO（15美元-165美元）跨越10倍--一些NET大男孩的收益。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-q8exct","excerpt":"I know quite a few people that don't invest in literally anything.
