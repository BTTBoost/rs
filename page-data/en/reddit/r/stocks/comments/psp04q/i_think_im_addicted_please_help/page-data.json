During the summer, I have a full-time job, starts before the market opens, and ends after the market ends. But right now, school starts, and I spent most of my time at home. </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t help myself constantly open trackers, my portfolios, and news relevant to my holdings. It is to a point where someone would consider it to be an addiction. I open the Fidelity app every 10mins, DURING THE WEEKENDS. I pull down to refresh, knowing that the number would be EXACTLY THE SAME as 10mins ago because the market is fricking closed. I just can&#39;t resist it. </p>\n\n<p>This addiction goes beyond stocks, I would open my checking account, even knowing there are no incoming transfers, open credit accounts even with no intention of paying it now. It&#39;s to a point I cannot focus on my classes, or concentrate when I try to finish my work.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone experienced this, how do you overcome it?
