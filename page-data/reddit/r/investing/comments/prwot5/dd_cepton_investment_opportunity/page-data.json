Cepton’s patented MMT®-based lidar technology enables reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solutions that deliver long range, high resolution 3D perception for smart applications.</p>\n\n<p>From the very start, Cepton has focused on the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) market. As disclosed in the S-4 filing, Cepton has the largest known lidar production award - GM selected Cepton as their lidar supplier for upcoming 2023-2027 cars featuring UltraCruise functionality.  Cepton has designed a suite of lidars exceptionally attractive to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like GM, Ford, and all other top 10 OEMs by being:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>automotive grade</li>\n<li>small form factor &amp; best-in-class performance</li>\n<li>ultra competitive price (tech advantage)</li>\n<li>partnership with tier 1 supplier (mass production)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Founded in April 2016 and led by industry veterans with over two decades of collective experience across a wide range of advanced lidar and imaging technologies, Cepton is focused on the mass market commercialization of high performance, high quality lidar solutions. Cepton is headquartered in San Jose, California, USA, with a presence in Germany, Canada, Japan and India, to serve a fast-growing global customer base.</p>\n\n<p>Cepton is going public via a SPAC merger ticker <strong>GCAC.</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html\">press statement</a> released on August 5th, 2021 suggests that the merger is &quot;expected to close in the Q4 2021&quot;.

According to both Cepton&#39;s investor presentation and S-4 filing, these things take considerable time (2+ years) &amp; have incredible competition (at least 30 lidars considered for GM production award). No other lidar company expects deployment on a significant number of vehicle models (especially non-luxury) anytime in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>Microvision (MVIS) has completed their <strong>prototype</strong> lidar in April 2021. Cepton finished their prototype in 2017, and is currently fine tuning the mass production process. Futhermore, Microvision recently claimed that they would win the markets by being cheap and selling their lidars for an AVERAGE of less than $1000. Cepton lidars are &lt; $500 with the Nova lidar being &lt; $100. Needless to say, Cepton is not concerned with competition from Microvision at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting fact I noticed: many Velodyne and Innoviz leaders have left and decided to join Cepton.</p>\n\n<h1>SPAC Transaction Overview</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>  Transaction reflects a ~$1.5Bn value for Cepton</li>\n<li>  Ownership: 85% Cepton shareholders, 12% SPAC IPO &amp; founder shares, 3% PIPE investors </li>\n<li>  $58.5mm PIPE raised</li>\n<li>  $1.774 bn pro forma equity value</li>\n<li>  $1.549 bn pro forma enterprise value\n\n<ul>\n<li>  1.8x  2025E revenue of $861mm</li>\n<li>  4.6x 2025E Adj.

This seems quite unlikely as both Cepton and GCAC have experienced leadership &amp; backgrounds. </p>\n\n<p>Cepton&#39;s deal with GM falls through. While again this is theoretically possible, the chances seem very small based on the investor presentation &amp; S-4 filing. Cepton had been in talks with GM for years before the announcement, and GM went through an extensive selection process of over 40 other lidar companies. Furthermore, Cepton is already partnered and supported by Koito, a Tier 1 supplier already approved and supplying parts for GM vehicles. </p>\n\n<p>The AV market is a bust. Cepton is currently focused on mass-market Lidar serving ADAS, which is a very real &amp; growing market. While it is true that currently the lidar market is pretty saturated, there is definitely an addressable market for ADAS in vehicles in the next 5 years. Cepton&#39;s ability to actually land the largest known Lidar production deal is nothing to scoff at. </p>\n\n<h1>Notes and resources</h1>\n\n<p>I urge everyone to do their own research &amp; DD. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a list of resources to start with: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf%5D(https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf\">Investor presentation</a>) </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29%5D(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29\">S-4 filing</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html%5D(https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html\">Press release for Cepton + GCAC merger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dailyadvent.com/news/9283e8963297dea4b9b25a78e41113f6-General-Motors-Selects-Cepton-To-Supply-Lidar-For-2023-Production\">Forbes - GM selects Cepton to supply Lidar</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Cepton&amp;oq=assignee:(Cepton\">Cepton patents</a>](<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Cepton&amp;oq=assignee:(Cepton))\">https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Cepton&amp;oq=assignee:(Cepton))</a>) </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cepton.com/products/overview%5D(https://www.cepton.com/products/overview\">Cepton products</a>) </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.just-auto.com/interview/lidar-of-the-pack-qa-with-cepton/%5D(https://www.just-auto.com/interview/lidar-of-the-pack-qa-with-cepton/\">Q&amp;A interview with Cepton CEO</a>) </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Cepton has strong fundamentals, landed impressive deals and partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout leader in the lidar market. ADAS (safety &amp; assist) is not as sexy as AV (self driving), but there is a clear market for it TODAY, and Cepton has already taken the first step with the landmark deal to supply lidar for multiple GM cars.</p>\n\n<p>As of writing this post, GCAC is trading at $9.89, and is a relatively low-risk investment as SPAC&#39;s typically have a $10 floor due to the ability to redeem the stock at closing of the merger for $10.</p>\n\n<p>While the lidar &amp; SPAC markets are not so hot at the moment, I still see Cepton as undervalued at the moment, and the situation as a great low-downside investment opportunity. If Cepton succeeds with its engagements with all top 10 OEM&#39;s, then this current price would be one hell of a steal. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Game plan</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>I bought &amp; plan to hold shares for several years. </p>\n\n<p>You can also just play the merger - buy now, then hold until the merger date &amp; decide then whether to keep or sell.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Buy shares, GCAC will change to CPTN after the merger. Shares will be 1:1</li>\n<li>Warrants, GCACW, if you&#39;re not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50</li>\n<li>Options trading - buying calls &amp; selling puts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Cepton quietly landed massive deals &amp; partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout lidar company. Currently GCAC is trading at &lt;$10, which is usually the floor for SPACs. This seems like a fairly low-risk low-downside investment, with great upsides at the moment since awareness of Cepton is so low.</p>\n\n<p>You could also check out <a href=\"https://assets.website-files.com/5fda6517fa06201bd2829536/610b6b067aca0357e44ee137_Cepton_Announcement%20Presentation_vFF_present.pdf\">their investor presentation.</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nothing I ever say or do is a financial recommendation.
