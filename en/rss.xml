In June, I invested heavily in Stock A. As of today, I have $10k in &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;unrealized losses&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; on Stock A.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’d like to sell Stock A to realize those losses and offset my gains for the year (to pay taxes on net 5k profit).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But I also want to continue to hold this position in Stock A. My original plan was to hold this investment until mid next year. So I want to immediately repurchase this stock after realizing the losses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What is the impact of this wash sale? Can I still offset the gains with these losses?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What risk am I taking by doing this?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She has access to excellent medical insurance and the only big cash outlay she’s thinking of the future is potentially a summer house somewhere inexpensive or travelling around the world.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given she’s not committed on either, her cash position has been bothering her and asked for help on what to do with it given her retirement age. Stocks looks like the obvious choice, but if the market were to crater in the near future that would likely ruin her retirement— not the day-to-day expenses to the point she has to go to work, but anything you would look forward to retirement, e.g., travelling the world relatively carefree.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What would you do if this was e.g., your mom?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whipsaw session today in the market. After opening higher in the morning stocks slid steeply downwards as market participants digested new remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and new concerns surrounding the coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant, with the US detecting its first case in California earlier today. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Notable Numbers Today&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.10%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.7%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Dow Jones (DIA): -1.29%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Meta (FB): -4.27%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Tesla (TSLA): -4.35%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;SPY Airline ETF: -3.27%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;VIX: +3.77%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Alibaba (BABA): -4.10%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At around 1 p.m. ET, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that it identified the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus Omicron variant in the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters the person was a traveler who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22 and tested positive on Nov. 29. Fauci said the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot and was experiencing “mild symptoms.” On November 26, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/26/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/&quot;&amp;gt;President Biden’s administration announced it was instituting a travel ban on South Africa &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;and other African nations in an effort to curb the spread. The US now joins about two dozen countries that have detected the coronavirus Omicron virus. The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa on November 24.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;He said, “There is no world, I think, where [the effectiveness] is the same level we had with [the] Delta [variant]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Powell said, ““We tend to use [the word transitory] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;quot;Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.&amp;amp;quot; -Ralph Waldo Emerson&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

At first, it seemed scary on Thanksgiving when news break of the high number of mutations. but now it&amp;amp;#39;s turning out to be a milder version of Delta. Us retail investors are thinking, &amp;amp;quot;why panic over a COVID variant now all of a sudden?&amp;amp;quot;. Delta wasn&amp;amp;#39;t a big deal, why do markets care now?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Maybe it&amp;amp;#39;s because Omicron presents the idea that COVID is officially over and it&amp;amp;#39;ll now be similar to a endemic flu. Omicron is turning out to have very mild symptoms while being highly transmissible. This may be the variant we&amp;amp;#39;ve been waiting for to make COVID-19 a thing of the past. As we know, the FED has had a huge impact on markets the past few years. Omicron signals that the FED no longer has an excuse for QE or money printing. Markets are forward-looking and maybe investors view this as the final block to closing up the COVID-19 chapter in 2022. Now tapering and raising rates are coming closer and closer to reality...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jack Dorsey’s payments giant said in an announcement the new name, effective Dec. 10, “acknowledges the company’s growth” and “creates room for further growth.” Block will still trade under the ticker SQ on the Nasdaq.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs,” Jack Dorsey, cofounder and CEO of Block, said in a statement. “Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dorsey co-founded Square in 2009 with a focus on in-person payments and its namesake card reader, which let people accept credit card payments on a smartphone. San Francisco-based Square has since added a peer-to-peer digital banking app, small business lending, received a bank charter and offers crypto and stock trading. The company has acquired buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay and Jay-Z’s music streaming service Tidal. It’s also doubling down on bitcoin with a crypto-focused business called TBD.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As part of the Square rebrand, a separate part of the company “dedicated to advancing Bitcoin,” known as Square Crypto, will change its name to Spiral.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“The name has many associated meanings for the company — building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome,” Block said in a statement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dorsey stepped down from his other job as Twitter CEO on Monday after running both Twitter and Square since 2015. Dorsey cited a belief Twitter was “ready to move on from its founders,” and will now have more time to dedicate to Square’s growing portfolio. But Dorsey is also expected to focus on his fascination with cryptocurrency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The news comes roughly a month after Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect on CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to build a virtual world called the metaverse. Google famously renamed itself Alphabet six years ago in a similar move to reflect other lines of business.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Square was one of the biggest winners of 2020 as consumers shifted to digital payments. Shares are down roughly 2% so far this year, as investors rotate away from higher-growth tech names.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However now, after its earnings in early November, the company has been dropping like a stone and is 23% down since then (and 6% just today!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The earnings were mostly good, with huge growth but higher loss per share than anticipated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The company is favoured by analysts with a &amp;amp;quot;Buy&amp;amp;quot; rating and average price target of 400$, it has good press (often mentioned as a stock to buy with a high potential), it has multiple sources of revenue (e-commerce, e-sports, payments) yet it keeps dropping and dropping for a month now, now at a level last time seen around June.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At first i thought that some red might come from associating it with chinese stocks (even though the company is from Singapore) but not a nearly 25% drop...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Is there something I&amp;amp;#39;m not seeing here?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have been investing 15% of my income into my 401(k) for the last 3.5 years. It is at $80,000. It is through Fidelity and invested in a Vanguard TRF. My company matches $0.50 up to 6%. I have never maxed out my contributions but my yearly 6-7% profit sharing bonus helps me exceed the number (I know it doesn’t count against the limit).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I just started a Roth IRA with Vanguard. All of it is in VTSAX. I will max that out each year moving forward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Am I doing this right? Should I go back and max out the 401k? Should I put all additional income towards the car? Should I open a taxable brokerage account and build that up as well in case I need to use that money?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is my setup:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enter (3min bars)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I took 11 stocks from yahoo article named &amp;amp;quot;11 Best Covid Vaccine Stocks&amp;amp;quot;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Each day I was waiting for 1% (or more) dip between 9:30am and 11:00am&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;I was buying a stock if there is a single green candle after the dip&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;If there are multiple stocks I was buying the one with the largest dip&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Max 2 trades per day&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Exit (1min bars)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Exit when stock recovered 1%&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Each position had 0.25% trailing stop loss&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Always exit by the EOD&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Initial capital $10,000&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The surge in new customers this year, fueled in part by free phone offers and slightly higher consumer spending, will probably cool off next year, McElfresh said at the event hosted by Wells Fargo &amp;amp;amp; Co. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“There’s no doubt that the stimulus programs have put some extra cash into household budgets,” McElfresh said. “And so we’re not expecting that level of activity to continue into 2022 and beyond.” &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The executive, who leads the company’s wireless phone unit, added that AT&amp;amp;amp;T would take “more than our fair share” of growth in the business over the next two to three years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AT&amp;amp;amp;T shares were trading down 5.3% to $22.63 at 1:01 p.m. in New York. The comments also sent mobile peers Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. down about 2% and 4%, respectively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the things I found was this: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was looking for a co-relation between the stock market and rates, but basically even when rates were not 0 and increasing (2016-2019) the market rallied anyways... well, not exactly, trade wars with China in 2018 caused quite a dip but that recovered in like 6 months and then kept on rallying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My question is: why is everyone going crazy about how if they increase rates now everything is gonna crash? Historically speaking rates have never been increased in a ridiculous manner, as in they increase in either a slow and steady manner or in a &amp;amp;quot;ladder&amp;amp;quot; graph manner (see 2004 and 2015 onwards). The dotcom bubble happened while rates were over 5%, same with the 2008 one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Based on the last 20~ years we can expect rates to take at least 2 years to go back up to a &amp;amp;quot;decent&amp;amp;quot; point (2~3%). What this means is that unless a first-time-ever event happens the FED is probably gonna increase their rates next year starting in either spring or summer and at the end of 2022 they&amp;amp;#39;re probably still gonna be sub 1%... which means we&amp;amp;#39;re talking about a 2~4 year progress until rates stop climbing and stabilize.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This makes me wonder: why is everyone talking as if the FED starting to increase rates is the apocalypse for the market? What am I missing? Is everyone just absolutely ignorant or am I the one who&amp;amp;#39;s missing some other factors? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I understand there&amp;amp;#39;s the whole debt to pay your debts, rollovers, whatever you want to call these things, as in highest interest rates = more expensive to finance growth, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see how very slight increases are that much of a problem, it&amp;amp;#39;s still very cheap money and even though it might slow growth I don&amp;amp;#39;t see how it will stop it and make everything crash. Sure, the market will slow down a bit, growth stocks might stop skyrocketing 40~100% every year, but I don&amp;amp;#39;t see how they would stop growing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11&quot;&amp;gt;Business Insider&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11&quot;&amp;gt;Bank of America&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This Will Not Last - &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/&quot;&amp;gt;Nick Maggiulli&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adding to all of this, we can see that the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/095t1dtniq281.png?width=899&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=7db181ad101f44183162eae205bcdb5fb857e01f&quot;&amp;gt;Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;While it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back [1].&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So what I wanted to analyze is: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! [2]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Warning Signs&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 crossed 40, which is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;the highest reading in the last two decades&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fzax1ecriq281.png?width=600&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b59bc4f2bfde765ffab5deb3376ddae53b5fe4c3&quot;&amp;gt;1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Increasing use of leverage&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/&quot;&amp;gt;This survey conducted by Magnifymoney&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. [3]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/kkx1cfjtiq281.png?width=854&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=b8af5f2398c5273fc770ba1f6a265ad3ffcf1a7b&quot;&amp;gt;Research by Goldman Sachs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;the entire market used to do in 2019&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Rise of new issues and speculative assets&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo&quot;&amp;gt;the Rivian IPO&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SPACs [4] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/&quot;&amp;gt;large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypto where &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:%7E:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&amp;amp;amp;text=It&amp;amp;#x27;s%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.&quot;&amp;gt;NFTs are being sold&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Investor expectations&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More than the P/E ratio, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;i&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qnfuyiqwiq281.png?width=1125&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=fb279b8dae3bd9803be4b8f7bf26c1984f7a87b8&quot;&amp;gt;nvestor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company&amp;amp;#39;s sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you consider a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/&quot;&amp;gt;four-year time period&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Are we certain it’s a bubble?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Low-interest rates&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/x1408niziq281.png?width=700&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=ee123520c9b2ea0d2f9b10b59d6b2fd181fac446&quot;&amp;gt;historically low 0.25% that we have now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New Investors&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/lpojhko0jq281.png?width=935&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1ede81940da2355edc282ba1feca54bad415c4b0&quot;&amp;gt;But the data they put out during their IPO filing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;401(k) and Index funds&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As I have highlighted in &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/&quot;&amp;gt;one of my previous article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/&quot;&amp;gt;more than 50% of the fund market&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. According to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html&quot;&amp;gt;this report&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market [5].&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;What’s the implication?&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Conclusion&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But, that’s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The expected annual return by investors &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/b4vspq13jq281.png?width=928&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=aa81e2478da9eb80ba1b001e0a2c6b29d9313b97&quot;&amp;gt;above inflation is a whopping 17.5%&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;(which is 161% more than what is realistic) — This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Even if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915&quot;&amp;gt;this thread from Corry Wang&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‘98), &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;making money using that information was hard!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/&quot;&amp;gt;crash from as far back as 2017&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As Peter Lynch quoted,&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Until next week…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[1] The amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zero-commission trading model was staggering. In the 1980s average commission per trade was $45.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[3] Leverage only makes sense as long as the equity you are investing into would give better returns than the cost of capital at which you borrowed. Otherwise, your losses are magnified as you have to pay the interest for the borrowed money as well as take your losses on the underlying asset.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

It’s generally considered riskier to invest in a SPAC as it has lower reporting/regulatory requirements when compared to traditional IPOs&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
