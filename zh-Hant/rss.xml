&lt;p&gt;Parent is retired and receiving deceased spouses pension. Post-retirement financials are something I am not familiar with, but my understanding is she should transition to a large percentage of bonds at this point to significantly lessen her risk tolerance (60/40 or 50/50?). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a little overwhelmed of what to recommend. I think she should speak to a fiduciary possibly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any guidance or if a suggestion of a different subreddit that would be more appropriate. I have learned a lot here about my own retirement savings so wanted to ask here first.&lt;/p&gt;

I logged in and saw all my options moved from out of to in the money, and I was up a couple hundred on my shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinhood did not update my portfolio balance and I figured it was bad WiFi. I switched to LTE. Same thing. Then I was hit with an unexpected error message, so I restarted the app. Then, I get told I could not log in. With the recent hacks, I became nervous. I did a web search and found that “several users were experiencing problems with login preventing them from logging into their account”. One hour later, I log back in to see that the moment I was checking my account I was up $2,000 and was now up $500. I love the Robinhood interface and commission free trades but damn.

Naturally, since I&amp;#39;m in it for a long term it doesn&amp;#39;t matter that much if there is a correction, however a correction does mean I could get more shares in it.

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I decided to start our bogleheads journey 3 months ago. We are both working fulltime and are still figuring out how much we can allocate to our Vanguard index fond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do monthly contributions to our savings account (emergency fund, vacation money etc. ) and to our index fond. My question is do you guys reach a certain point after you eliminate the monthly contributions to your savings account? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still discussing about this because if we stop contributing to our savings account we could of course invest way more into vanguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently we contribute 2k into Vanguard and 2k into savings account each month - we have around 30k in Vanguard and 100k in savings account. Together we make about 180k per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Free Cash Flow was -$344M this quarter.  The company is burning roughly $300M/quarter this year (despite shutting off sales and marketing) and has $1.1B left… At this rate, the company will be insolvent by next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajiv Patel, an environmental consultant in Austin, Texas, put down a $1,000 deposit on a Rivian electric SUV earlier this year. He has no idea when he’ll get his vehicle, called the R1S, but his down payment is paying off in a very different way. As a pre-order customer, Patel was able to buy into Rivian’s IPO on Tuesday night as part of the company’s directed share program. He purchased the maximum 175 shares for $13,650 at the $78 IPO price. After the stock popped 29% on Wednesday, Patel’s stake is now worth $17,628. “When I invest in these companies, I’m always a long hold guy,” said Patel, 45, adding that he invested in Tesla not long after its 2010 IPO and also bought shares in Lucid Motors, which went public in July. “I’m definitely not a meme stock guy. With these three, I feel good about the tech.” The tech is all Patel can currently bet on. Following its Nasdaq debut on Wednesday, Rivian has a market cap of $86 billion, higher than Ford and about equal to General Motors, even though the company is projecting revenue of between zero and $1 million for the third quarter. Rivian reserved up to 7% of the IPO shares for DSP participants, as the company laid out in its prospectus. Eligible investors fell into two categories: People who reserved either an R1S or an R1T electric truck as of Sept. 30, and company officers, directors and their affiliates. The deposits are refundable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program follows similar moves by Airbnb, Uber and Doximity, which set aside shares in their offerings for hosts, drivers and doctors, respectively. What sets Rivian’s DSP apart is that the EV company doesn’t have actual customers yet, despite a backlog of 55,400 pre-orders, as of Oct. 31. Assuming the DSP allocated all its available shares, participants collectively invested about $835 million into Rivian’s stock. As of Wednesday’s close, those shares are worth a total of close to $1.08 billion, representing a paper gain of around $245 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua White, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University, said it’s a great deal for those who can participate because hot IPO stocks almost always enjoy a first-day pop, and retail investors usually get shut out. DSP investors can also sell immediately if they choose because they’re not subject to a post-IPO lock-up period. “You kind of know going in this is going to be a pretty good sweetheart deal for customers who sign up,” said White, who previously served as an economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Not having a product, it’s a way to extend some goodwill upfront so they can lock in those returns right away.” Patel received his first email about Rivian’s DSP last month and was told he needed to pre-register by Oct. 25. The program was being run by Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter on the IPO. After the stock priced at $78 late Tuesday, Patel was able to go into his Morgan Stanley account and select how many shares he wanted, up to 175. He selected the max and transferred the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its full-year earnings call today, Disney CEO Bob Chapek brought up the idea of the metaverse to shareholders for the first time. He began by pointing out Disney&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience,&amp;quot; offering examples such as Steamboat Willie (one of the first cartoons to be produced with synchronized sound), its historical use of animatronics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/movies/thor-love-and-thunder&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; broadly the technological work of Pixar in its animations.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on: &amp;quot;Suffice it to say, our efforts today are merely a prologue to a time when we&amp;#39;ll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse. We look forward to creating unparalelled opportunities for consumers to experience everything Disney has to offer across our product and platforms wherever the consumer may be.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As we look ahead to this next frontier, given our unique combination of brands, franchises, physical and digital experiences, and global reach, we see limitless potential, and that makes us as excited as ever about the Walt Disney Company&amp;#39;s next 100 years.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel like we&amp;#39;ve been hearing about the metaverse a lot lately, it&amp;#39;s because in the last year a lot of massive tech companies have been getting in on the idea. We&amp;#39;ve been hearing about it for a while now, with companies in gaming like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-epic-games-metaverse-and-is-it-worth-billions&quot;&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; seemingly interested in creating a persistent, virtual space that bridges the gap between virtual and the real world, and where people can interact with one another in real time. As more gaming companies brought it up, some have suggested that games such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Second Life already exist as a sort of proto-metaverse. But that hasn&amp;#39;t stopped companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-metaverse-announcement&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook (which just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/facebook-new-name-meta&quot;&gt;rebranded to Meta&lt;/a&gt; for exactly this reason) for also trying to take control of whatever this virtual future looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my position it seems that all the shit happening cannot last forever and it has to come crumbling down some time. But I am also very stupid. Any input welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I would like to also add that everyone always thought “oh I live in America where everything is made of sunshine and rainbows” but recently people have woken up to the fact that we are vulnerable to the same shit the third world countries have been dealing with for years. So if you think you are protected just because you live in a nice neighborhood, you are wrong. And you can primarily blame the government for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: of all the people saying “oh people have been saying this for years” or “just another gay bear.” None of those people have offered any evidence that I’m wrong, which I find interesting. And you dorks just saying “we had 12 green days in a row” that literally proves my point. That the market is stupid and not based on anything close to resembling fundamentals and that this market is simply unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I import things from China. There are thousands of companies like mine. We are the one that sells shit to ur the distributors, the distributors sells to stores. We are also the one directly sells on Amazon and other e-commerce website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre COVID, a 40ft high cube costs me only $4000 from China to Long Beach. Currently it costs me god damn $20000, and that doesn’t include land transport. If I want to sent a container of goods to Ohio, the total cost on shipping alone is like $40000, excluding import duties. Back in the day shipping make up abt 30% of my cost, it makes up 60-70% now. Pre COVID a container of nice double layer fleece lining hoodies cost me 60k includes shipping. It costs me 100k this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 110 some container ships stuck outside of Long Beach. You probably have no idea how many that is..ima use the nice fleece lining hoodies as example again. Each 40ft high cube carry’s 6000 this hoodie (so 20ft carry abt 3000). Each ship carry 20000 TEU (20ft equivalent units). there are also some 2 million TEU still in the port waiting to be hauled.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do the math&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3000&lt;em&gt;20000=60 million hoodies 
110&lt;/em&gt;20000=2.2million containers on ship stuck outside still. 
2.2million+2million=4.2 millions on containers total. 
4200000*60000000=252000000000000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US population is 333000000 
That’s 756 thousand hoodies for each person just stuck there waiting to be distributed! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say my number is off by 50%, it’s still 378 thousands hoodies just stuck there! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t unload at Houston or New York cuz it will cost us even more… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem Is not the demand, it’s supply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not that there are too many monies were printed, who cares if we print more money, we can print unlimited useless pieces of paper and buy real goods from China ( export our Inflation)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if u see on the news that the supply chain has been fixed, or the port of Long Beach has been cleared, or you know inflation is about to stapled.. until that , whatever the fed say is bs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side note Biden should declare national emergency and have nat guard come in and help haul these sticker goods.&lt;/p&gt;

   分析方法，但是，有兩個關鍵點是非常突出的。]]></description><link>https://stocks.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qr5eb1/just_some_thoughts_on_some_things_starting_to/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://stocks.buzzing.cc/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qr5eb1/just_some_thoughts_on_some_things_starting_to/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 11:51:12 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to give some attention to a few metrics I&amp;#39;ve been keeping an eye on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CAPE Schiller P/E 10 ratio for the S&amp;amp;P is nearing all time highs (CAPE=39.29).  It hasn&amp;#39;t been as great at predicting recessions as some other analysis methods, but, two key points that stand out on the historical chart did precede crashes.  We exceeded one of those levels and are approaching the other. The last time the Schiller ratio was near 40 was right before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000.  Prior to that, the last time it spiked to these levels it preceded the great depression (CAPE = 32) in 1929. The economist who developed this ratio was given the Nobel prize for using this ratio to predict the dot com bubble, so this measurement does carry some weight.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.nasdaq.com/data/MULTPL/SHILLER_PE_RATIO_MONTH-shiller-pe-ratio-by-month&quot;&gt;https://data.nasdaq.com/data/MULTPL/SHILLER_PE_RATIO_MONTH-shiller-pe-ratio-by-month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rumors are surfacing that Evergrande has defaulted on one of it&amp;#39;s payments.  This is hearsay at this point, but it seems very suspicious that some banks and bond holders are not commenting on if they are receiving payment from Evergrande.  It also stands to reason, the company is fighting to keep their heads above water to make these payments but they are over $300b in debt.  In reality they are just kicking the can down the road.  It&amp;#39;s a house of cards at this point and the bottom is being pulled out, it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-await-evergrandes-overdue-148-mln-payment-amid-contagion-fears-2021-11-09/&quot;&gt;https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-await-evergrandes-overdue-148-mln-payment-amid-contagion-fears-2021-11-09/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasury yield curves are flattening.  This is a potentially huge indicator of the uncertainty within the market.  It has reliably predicted the last 7 recessions up to and within 18 months of an inverted yield curve.  The curve is not currently inverted but is starting to flatten. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Strategists are watching the move in the Treasury curve which is showing a narrowing between long end yields, like the 30-year and the shorter end, like the 5-year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The flattening of the curve reflects more hawkish fed assumptions, also reflected in the fed funds futures market,” said Jeffery. He said the spread between the 5-year and 30-year is narrower, at 68 basis points, or 0.68 percentage points. That is the flattest since the early weeks of the pandemic in March, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A flattening yield curve can indicate that investors are worried about a weakening economy.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter outlook, indicating that sales aren’t expected to snap back immediately. Shares of the company tumbled 18% in extended trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss per share: 87 cents vs. 39 cents expected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue: $106.4 million vs. $109.2 million expected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond reported fiscal third-quarter net loss of $54.8 million, or 87 cents per share, wider than a net loss of $19.3 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected a loss of 39 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company said it faced higher transportation and warehousing costs and increased its inventory write-offs, which hurt its profits. About $9 million was written off due to water damage at one of its plants, which mostly affected packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net sales rose 12.7% to $106.4 million, missing expectations of $109.2 million. Compared with the second quarter, its revenue fell, bucking typical seasonal trends for the company’s products. Customers usually buy more Beyond Burgers during the summer to grill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company reported strong growth outside the United States, with international grocery and restaurant divisions each seeing sales more than double during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, U.S. revenue fell 13.9% compared with a year ago, mostly due to weaker grocery demand. CEO Ethan Brown told analysts that grocery sales didn’t help make up for shrinking food service orders, unlike in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also said softer demand and operational challenges, like severe weather, hurt its domestic sales. Brown said new competitors in the market are putting pressure on its market share, but data doesn’t reveal that the lower demand is due to other companies stealing its customers. New products, like its meatless chicken, slightly offset U.S. sales declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, the company warned investors that it would be reporting weaker sales than it had previously predicted, citing a wide range of factors, including the delta variant and distribution problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the company’s forecast doesn’t indicate a sunnier fourth quarter. Beyond is predicting net sales of $85 million to $110 million for those three months. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $131.6 million during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond said it’s expecting some of the operational challenges from the third quarter to drag down its fourth-quarter results as well. It also cited restaurants’ labor challenges and hesitant ordering behavior due to uncertainty tied to the pandemic as other factors embedded in the outlook. The company noted that the period contains 5 fewer shipping days than a year prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Near-term market and operating conditions notwithstanding, we remain committed to our long-term strategy,” Brown said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told analysts he is feeling optimistic about 2022. He hinted at new product launches coming next year, saying that some of those items could reach price parity with meat.&lt;/p&gt;

The &amp;quot;bad news&amp;quot; is that she&amp;#39;s now an expert on personal finance and thinks that our asset allocation (85% equities and 15% fixed income, with a 12+ month emergency fund) is too aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She likes the idea of &amp;quot;your age in bonds,&amp;quot; though she is willing to compromise on 80% equities and 20% fixed income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fortunate enough to be able to max out our 401(k) and Roth IRA and have a bit left over for investments in a taxable account. &lt;strong&gt;With that in mind, my question is... would your asset allocation plan change if you had $5,000 / yr to invest vs. what we currently do?&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, all things being equal, can you afford to be more aggressive as the value of your portfolio increases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: We compromised on 80% equities / 20% bonds as long as I get to invest a bit more of our emergency fund in I bonds. Case closed :) Thanks for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of caveats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dizzying rally in the stock market came to a screeching halt following the release of a key inflation report that showed a greater than expected jump in consumer prices despite new jobless claims coming in at a pandemic-era low. The S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.8% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.47% in its third consecutive red day while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.61% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 1.58% lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Fed has commenced a tapering in the pace of quantitative easing, members of the Fed have so far maintained that supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances caused by the pandemic have prevented producers from keeping up with demand, particularly as we head into the busiest time of the year, the holiday season. I broadly agree with this narrative, even the Fed has conceded that inflation could last longer “than they currently assume”. The latest Fed meeting minutes said, “Most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.” We’ll have to see what happens in the coming months, if inflation doesn’t begin moderating in the next 5-6 months, the Fed will likely be forced to step in and raise interest rates in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. &lt;/p&gt;

Today, between Evergrande, crypto, and lord knows what else, there are plenty of reasons for uncertainty. I don&amp;#39;t have an investing diary, exactly, but I have a pretty good account of my own investor sentiment since I started investing in 2013. My approach was Bogle-inspired, although as I note, I shifted a bit (often for bad reasons). I thought I might share them, as a good representation of timing the market, as well as illustrating other cognitive biases one might have (e.g. the way we can become overcommitted to a strategy once we have emotionally invested in it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 2015: I started to get worried when the Shiller forward P/E went above 25, the level it was before the 2008 financial crisis. I have generally fretted about this, and the Buffet indicator (market cap: GDP) since then. I did shift my portfolio from being 100% domestic to include international index funds at this point (not that it did any good).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November 2016: I thought Trump winning the 2016 election would tank the markets (actually it did briefly upset overnight futures markets). It didn&amp;#39;t, of course. Rather, the market boomed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 2017: I still remember the cover of The Economist. &amp;quot;The bull market in everything&amp;quot;. I was sure that there was something afoot. There would be a few subsequent moments that felt like &amp;quot;now it&amp;#39;s about to start&amp;quot;. In February 2018 the VIX surged as the trade war accelerated and the Fed raised rates above 1%. There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; (and this points to the difficulty of timing) a sharp correction in December 2018, but the market almost immediately recovered.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 2019: the yield curve inverted, and once again I began to thought that the end was nigh. There was going to be a recession and that was it. The rise of the S&amp;amp;P 500 into early 2020 felt suspicious to me. Arguably, this is the one time my gut might have been right. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; I was right for the wrong reasons. The crash of 2020 was caused by the pandemic, which I obviously hadn&amp;#39;t considered in August 2019 (nor even in January 2020). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 9, 2020: now, those were crazy times my friend. Some days were up double-digits and some were down by the same. It was circuit breaker city, man. Critically though, the signs of a financial crisis were there - repo markets were drying up and even treasuries were dropping.On March 9th I came damn close to shifting large amounts of my portfolio into bonds. I still have the trade confirmation, though I stopped it at the last second. The S&amp;amp;P 500 had fallen to something like 2800.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 9, 2020: I held through the bottom, when a strange thing started happening. The market recovered very rapidly. In a few days the S&amp;amp;P 500 was up from a low of something in the 2200s to almost 2800. I thought there was no way it could keep going like this. I remember looking at graphs (which people were posting widely at the time) showing the market through the Great Depression. One of the striking takeaways was that it hadn&amp;#39;t just been down down down followed by recovery. There were so many bear traps. Could this be one of them? It was at this point that I broke from Bogle advice. As the market recovered, I shifted modest amounts into bonds reasoning that when the real bottom appeared I would buy everything cheap. A completely irrational factor in my move: relatives bragging that they saw the crash coming and pulled everything out just in time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 6, 2020: as my fear of bear traps receded, I reverted back to my long-term optimal portfolio. One day later, the market saw the biggest crash since the heady days of March. A-ha! I thought. It turns out I was right all along. And &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I was - unemployment had just hit the highest levels since the Great Depression, some states were prematurely reopening from the pandemic, etc. I didn&amp;#39;t sell everything, but I maintained an overly bond-heavy portfolio for my age (mid-30s). As the market rose further in July and August, I continued to shift assets to bonds (I also shifted my bond holdings to TIPS which did work out... so far). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2020: through August I had read the story about Softbank&amp;#39;s sometimes insane bets on tech, and was again sure that a crash was nigh. I felt bearish - one day I went running in the woods and literally saw a family of black bears crossing the road. And indeed, the S&amp;amp;P 500 started to correct (the Nasdaq somewhat more). And yet... pretty soon after, it was back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 22, 2021: this story involves my active trading account, which represents a very small proportion of my investments. When GME started to surge to $65 (vs. $4 in August 2020) following the beginnings of the campaign on Wall Street Bets, I was sure that the stock would fall. I bought OTM puts. When it rose more, I bought more OTM puts - and I even was able to time the peak correctly the second time. Obviously, the first set of puts became worthless, but interestingly, so did the second because I had bought them when volatility was so high that the stock would have to hit ridiculously low levels for my puts to print.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure that there are other folks out there who are better investors than I. Maybe they have the time to do research and find diamonds in the rough. Maybe they have the discipline to avoid going double or nothing (and to resist confirmation bias) when their theses prove false. And hey, maybe they are smarter and possessed of some abilities that I lack. But I would have to say that the smartest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done is to ignore my instincts, saved, diversified, and waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Evergrande, the troubled property giant, made interest payments on at least two of its bonds on Wednesday, a company bondholder said, a sign that it yet again managed to head off default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evergrande owed investors interest payments totaling nearly $150 million on three bonds, with the grace periods for those payments set to expire on Wednesday. Missing them would have triggered a default that could ripple through the Chinese economy: With some $300 billion in debt outstanding, the company’s inability to pay its debt would potentially hurt banks, property developers, and even home buyers in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the company has managed to leap from one deadline to the next, meeting its obligations at the last minute — but often without explaining how or even publicly disclosing that it had done so. The company has tried to sell off parts of its empire to raise enough cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October, when Evergrande said it had scrapped its effort to sell a $2.6 billion stake in its property services company to another developer, the company warned in a Hong Kong securities filing that there was “no guarantee” it would be able to meet its financial obligations or negotiate an extension with its creditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the company met its interest payment deadline for bonds that mature in 2022 and 2023, the company bondholder said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person did not specify if a payment on the third bond had also been made, but Bloomberg News reported that obligations for all three bonds were met, citing a spokesman for a clearing house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Evergrande has managed to avoid default so far, its troubles have already begun to weigh on other Chinese developers, with the government tightening controls on borrowing and investors retreating from the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least six Chinese property developers have defaulted on foreign bonds in recent weeks, rattling domestic financial markets and raising the cost of borrowing for all Chinese companies. Property prices are slowing and fewer people are buying apartments, worsening the outlook for real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evergrande’s challenges could spread outside of China as well, as they ripple through global financial markets. On Monday, the Federal Reserve said troubles in China’s property sector could threaten the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through a deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States,” the Fed said in its twice-yearly update on the American financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

Already so many &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; earnings and so much time &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; not being in the market.
