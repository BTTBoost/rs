The trade typically saw hedge funds borrow money in the repo market to arbitrage the difference between Treasuries in the cash market and futures. But in March of 2020, as investors stampeded into the most liquid contracts in the market (Treasury futures), the spread between the two suddenly went haywire, leaving hedge funds to nurse significant losses.</p>\n\n<p>You can see just how painful the trade was in the below excerpt from the paper, which show hedge funds’ average returns over time:  </p>\n\n<p>“Given that the mean quarterly return over our sample is 2.3% with a standard deviation of 8.1%, a sector-wide return of -9.9% reflects unprecedented losses for these hedge funds, which is also depicted in Figure 5. This indicates that during the COVID-19 crisis in March, these hedge funds were under a significant amount of stress, to a greater extent than at any point since Form PF reporting started in 2012. Clearly, the current crisis unfolded more precipitously than the global financial crisis in 2007-2009, which was characterized by relatively longer periods of a buildup of uncertainty from 2007 onward.”</p>\n\n<p>By March 15, after yields had been spiking for about seven days, the Fed announced a new U.S. Treasury and mortgage bond purchasing facility aimed at soothing the mayhem in the world’s most important funding market. By the end of the month, the central bank had purchased some $775 billion in U.S. government debt and $291 billion in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. housing agencies.</p>\n\n<p>According to the paper, much of the blow-up in basis trades occurred not because of a pullback in repo funding from big dealer-banks trying to protect their balance sheets, but rather as function of good old-fashioned liquidity management in anticipation of investor redemptions. Here, longer lockups on hedge fund money may actually have helped protect the market and prevent the crisis from becoming much worse.</p>\n\n<p>Or, as the authors put it:</p>\n\n<p>“We find evidence that the cutback in hedge fund UST exposures was driven by liquidity management considerations and investor redemption risks. By the end of March 2020, hedge funds with significant Treasury exposures increased their cash holdings by over 20% and scaled down the size and illiquidity of their portfolios. This boost to the precautionary liquidity holdings and the step back from UST market activity were less pronounced for funds with stricter share restrictions and lower redemption risk. Longer share restrictions allowed hedge funds to avoid fire sales and hold onto more of their convergence trades, thereby bolstering both fund and Treasury market stability … </p>\n\n<p><strong>Compared to previous crisis episodes, the March 2020 shock was unprecedented, particularly in the speed and scale at which extreme moves occurred and in its impact on otherwise safe and liquid markets such as the UST market.”</strong></p>\n\n<p>The whole paper is available here.\n<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/hedge-fund-treasury-trading-and-funding-fragility-evidence-from-the-covid-19-crisis.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/hedge-fund-treasury-trading-and-funding-fragility-evidence-from-the-covid-19-crisis.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is the Link to the Bloomberg article:\n<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-28/by-one-measure-march-2020-was-worse-than-the-financial-crisis?sref=K5kiE5Jr\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-28/by-one-measure-march-2020-was-worse-than-the-financial-crisis?sref=K5kiE5Jr</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/o9c9hv/by_one_measure_march_2020_was_worse_than_the/","title":"By One Measure, March 2020 Was Worse Than the Financial Crisis","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"June 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-06-28T13:45:23.000Z","datetime":"2021-06-28 13:45","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"1eecc378-af23-5b99-99f5-d7d88f1a7f77","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o9c9hv/by_one_measure_march_2020_was_worse_than_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o9c9hv/by_one_measure_march_2020_was_worse_than_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"iggy555","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/iggy555","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"iggy555","score":73,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"2020年3月は金融危機よりも深刻だったとの指摘も","the_new_excerpt":"昨年の市場暴落の特徴の一つは、連邦準備制度（FRB）が何十億ドルものドルを買い取るという対応の速さでした。\n連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が、何十億ドルもの米国債の購入に踏み切ったことです。\n昨年の市場暴落の特徴のひとつは、財務省の市場が暴落してから数日以内に、連邦準備制度理事会が何十億ドルもの米国債の購入に踏み切ったことだ。\n\n米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が発表したワーキングペーパーによると、その理由は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"根据一项措施，2020年3月的情况比金融危机更糟糕","the_new_excerpt":"去年市场崩溃的标志之一是美联储对其作出反应的速度。\n美联储对其作出反应，介入购买价值数十亿美元的\n价值数十亿美元的美国政府债务，在国债市场瘫痪后的几天内。\n\n美联储的一份新的工作人员工作文件有助于解释...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"根據一項措施，2020年3月的情況比金融危機更糟糕","the_new_excerpt":"去年市場崩潰的標誌之一是美聯儲對其作出反應的速度。\n美聯儲對其作出反應，介入購買價值數十億美元的\n價值數十億美元的美國政府債務，在國債市場癱瘓後的幾天內。\n\n美聯儲的一份新的工作人員工作文件有助於解釋...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-55a4dabf-ecc9-5036-b83f-b33c664a3c3b","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o99spf/facebook_could_be_held_liable_for_sex_trafficking/","title":"Facebook could be held liable for sex trafficking on its platform, court rules","date":"June 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"フェイスブック、プラットフォーム上での性的人身売買の責任を問われる可能性があると裁判所が判断","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"法院裁定，Facebook可能要为其平台上的性贩运承担责任","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"法院裁定，Facebook可能要爲其平臺上的性販運承擔責任","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-5c29fb60-9ce8-5305-a348-aa21dcafd7c3","excerpt":"I’m pretty terrified of how much money was recently pumped into our economy.
