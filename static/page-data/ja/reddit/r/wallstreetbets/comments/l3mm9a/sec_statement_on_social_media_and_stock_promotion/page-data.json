I fully intend to hold GME for years, for example, because I believe in Cohen, much like many of us continue to hold Tesla even though it squoze considerably over the last year. In other words, only invest in companies that you think are worth owning, retards. We can&#39;t know what the market is going to do. GameStop may issue 60 million new shares, and I&#39;d still be happy to hold until Cohen leaves the company. The man&#39;s a business genius IMO. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, another SEC regulation is that only registered professionals can provide investment advice, so it goes without saying here that to ensure you&#39;re completely on the right side of the law, you need to include a disclaimer that any statement you make about a stock isn&#39;t investment advice. Needless to say, none of this is investing advice. Invest in any company at your own risk. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: reinstituting the positions or ban rule will keep WSB on the right side of the law, since it satisfies the need to disclose conflicts of interest. Also, don&#39;t pump and dump; only invest in companies that are popular on WSB if you think they&#39;re good investments, and do your own research. Finally, make sure to disclose that, like me, you are a retard and not qualified to give investing advice, so your post shouldn&#39;t be taken as investment advice. </p>\n\n<p>If we do all of this, the media can paint WSB in whatever light they&#39;d like, but the SEC would have no legal basis to shut WSB down.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I should learn how to finish sentences before I post.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: According to <a href=\"/u/minimum-watercress-8\">u/minimum-watercress-8</a> (who claims to be a lawyer and seems to know what he&#39;s talking about), the SEC wouldn&#39;t come after a random redditor, and he believes the odds of the SEC pressuring Reddit to shut down WSB are very low. I don&#39;t think it hurts to have the same kind of disclaimers and disclosures as stock articles posted online (e.g., this isn&#39;t investing advice, and I do/don&#39;t own a position in the stock), but according to minimum-watercress-8 it won&#39;t affect the legality of anything here.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: <a href=\"/u/amagadon\">u/amagadon</a> echoed the sentiment of <a href=\"/u/minimum-watercress-8\">u/minimum-watercress-8</a>, and said his source was his time in the industry. So according to these guys, the fear mongering caused by Larry Summers (who, coincidentally advised Clinton <em>against</em> regulating the housing market derivatives that led to the market collapse; I guess regulation is only good when it comes to regulating plebs, right?) and others like him is total BS. The SEC apparently won&#39;t regulate some random dude screaming his opinion, or a variety of random dudes (online forum) screaming their opinions about a stock.
