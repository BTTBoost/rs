I love that it&amp;#39;s a women-driven investment that is growing impressively fast around the world and sits at 500M monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leadership refers to the company as a personal media application and a search engine for ideas. Their two biggest changes has been the introduction of Shops,  which has pressured Instagram to release its own influencer version of shops and the release of Livestreams with tickets/waitrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love the direction that this company is going in and it in some ways it kind of reminds me of the intention of YouTube. Mostly women are going on the platform with an intent to plan or search, so the need for influencing is not nearly as high as it is on platforms like Facebook or Bytedance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, I&amp;#39;m bullish on Pinterest with respect to travel. I think we will see continued growth because people are planning their trips and it&amp;#39;s a lucrative market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long-term I&amp;#39;m bullish on it being one of the more effective forms of social media with respect to e-commerce and advertising effectiveness. A user may go on Instagram and spend more time, resulting in no net gain for an advertiser. A user on Pinterest is almost guarunteed to enter and exit with an attempted plan or shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on Pinterest?&lt;/p&gt;

When going over his archive of tweets he rails against tesla, robinhood and warns of a bubble in the market; what I don&amp;#39;t understand is why he would be visited by the SEC for expressing his opinion on twitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t this literally what the pundits on CNBC do all day? All I ever hear on that channel is &amp;quot;Buy, Buy, Buy,&amp;quot; whereas Burry&amp;#39;s tweets have substance behind them. For example, he warned about inflation in February and as of April 2021 it has begun to hit the markets. Also, when does someone become to big to express their opinion about the market?&lt;/p&gt;

Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat&amp;#39;s litter box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t think that Tesla will implode. He doesn&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let&amp;#39;s say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It&amp;#39;s not even worth cashing the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the &lt;strong&gt;interest rate&lt;/strong&gt; to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it&amp;#39;s just worth a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around ~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Burry TSLA short isn&amp;#39;t a bet against Tesla, it&amp;#39;s a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last friday we saw a first attempt to start a new uptrend. The first price target (12$) was reached in less than 24 hours. Subsequently the price got heavily rejected at the resistance level of 12$, forming a bearish candle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume on Friday was much higher than the average. The short sellers tried to push the share price down below the resistance at 12$ in order to avoid a further surge. I assume they are really  scared to see the price above that level because chartwise that means a bullish trend reversal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week Blackberry needs to break the resistance around 12$. Beyond 12$ there is almost no resistance besides the ATH. Furthermore the short interest rose during the consolidation since February. The percentage of float shorted is around 9% now (5/14/2021) which provides additional fuel for a squeeze. That means we could see a fast acceleration of the new uptrend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the share price of $BB falls below the support at 8.5$ the bullish scenario is &lt;strong&gt;not valid&lt;/strong&gt; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price targets:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 12$ ✅ 28th May&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2 25$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#3 48$&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, it’s become ubiquitous in new cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, over 80% of new cars sold support CarPlay, Apple said last year. That works out to about 600 new models, including cars from Volkswagen, BMW, and Chrysler. Toyota, one of the longest holdouts, started including CarPlay in 2019 models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a top feature for many drivers and car buyers. Twenty-three percent of new car buyers in the U.S. say they “must have” CarPlay and 56% percent are “interested” in having CarPlay when buying a new vehicle, according to a 2017 Strategy Analytics study. When Ford’s highly anticipated electric F-150 goes on sale, it will support CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple was able to insert itself in between customers and car companies and make sure that its interface was the one that every iPhone user wants while driving. It’s an under-appreciated triumph for one of the world’s most successful companies. CarPlay doesn’t contribute direct Apple revenues or profits. But it ensures ongoing loyalty of iPhone users and gives Apple a pathway into the auto industry if it wants to expand.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

Today, l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae&quot;&gt;Weekly chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don’t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356&quot;&gt;Daily chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day’s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b&quot;&gt;30 minutes chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20$ 07/16C AMC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30$ 07/16C AMC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski’s HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know. More price action is needed to accurately assess a higher target.&lt;/p&gt;

Otherwise, if you actually want to &lt;em&gt;invest&lt;/em&gt;, then let me give you a trick to help you approach the market correctly...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagine that the &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot; button is greyed out until a security is held for 5 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be holding this for 5+ years, so the time and effort spent on research and DD is fully justified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You won&amp;#39;t be &amp;quot;missing out&amp;quot; if you buy it tomorrow, or next week, or whenever you fully understand it and feel ready to commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth the commitment, so it&amp;#39;s completely reasonable to increase your position gradually over time (DCA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market dips are lame, but who cares? It&amp;#39;s not the 5d chart, it&amp;#39;s the 5y -- and it&amp;#39;s a 5y chart that has yet to be drawn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are only three situations in which the &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot; button becomes available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During your research, you find something that makes you lose faith in the security (e.g., you discover something that makes you doubt the company&amp;#39;s leadership during an earnings report).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You discover a competing security that you wish you would have known about previously. In this case, &lt;em&gt;roll your investment over&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You absolutely, positively need the money for an emergency. You should have enough money on hand to be able to weather a storm, but there are some extraneous circumstances where you absolutely must liquidate investments. (If this happens more than once, it&amp;#39;s a sign that you do not have a sufficient emergency fund.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at ARKK annual percentile returns (via Morningstar, performance percentile vs peers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015: 75th 
2016: 98th

2018: 17th

2020: 1st 
2021: 100th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARKK is selling themselves as alpha generators, but they don’t consistently capture alpha. In fact, These kind of swings implies that the fund has excessive risk not excessive skill. Market does well, fund does great; market does poorly, fund tanks. Leverage is totally fine but it’s cheap, especially these days.  if they are just loading up on volatility then it’s not worth the management fee. You can get that on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be putting in 6k immediately and will put in another 6k as soon as I&amp;#39;m allowed again until fully invested. My question is what would be the best fund for aggressive growth? 31 years old and looking to set it and forget it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago the company delivered a pretty wicked &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/05/26/xiaomi-posts-record-results-as-2021-q1-revenue-and-profit-hit-historical-high-levels/&quot;&gt;earnings report&lt;/a&gt; with an adjusted net profit increase of 163%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days prior I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jesbaek.com/2021/05/23/xiaomis-future/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; of how their unique &amp;#39;AIoT&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Internet Services&amp;#39; strategy will eventually allow the company to make much larger profits on revenue in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiaomi commands one of the largest product portfolios with smart enabled devices of every category. In the West we don&amp;#39;t yet see their smartphones too often - but their robo vacuum cleaners and electric scooters (They own Ninebot and Segway) and other smart home equipment is everywhere. They are basically taking the opposite route of Google and Apple in providing the hardware before the software - which also means they currently have higher costs and lower return on revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet they are already profitable and sit on a cash pile of 5.6 billion. About 60% of their revenue right now is however attributed to their smartphones - which are doing extremely well. Their phones receive high praise (though their Android fork is not liked by all) and offer unbeatable performance for the price. They do well in every price category and own several well known sub brands like Redmi, Poco and Blackshark. As an example Mrwhosetheboss (huge tech YT channel) picked Xiaomi brands for all top 3 spots for his best phones of 2021 out of 22.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiaomi holds the top spot in market share in several emerging markets: India, Russia and most of Eastern Europe and soon South America. In Scandinavia where I live, they just recently entered local carrier stores, began advertising actively and opened a local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mistore.dk&quot;&gt;official webshop&lt;/a&gt;. The ban on Huawei left a HUGE gap in the European market for Xiaomi to just freely gobble up and it seems like they are doing it. Xiaomi themselves have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-us-remove-blacklist-1224721/&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from a similar (but much less severe) blacklist by the US government this week as well. They do not pose the same threat as Huawei did, as they do not build infrastructure telecom equipment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are rumors of the company designing their own SoCs (chips) in collaboration with OPPO and just last month they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/chinas-xiaomi-to-launch-electric-car-business-and-invest-10-billion.html&quot;&gt;invested $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; into the Electric vehicle space. They already financially back Xpeng too and I think with the insane growth in the Chinese EV market they really have an opportunity to add even more value to their ecosystem integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is founded by Lei Jun and former Vice President of Google China and Zhou Gaungping then Senior Director at Motorola’s Beijing R&amp;amp;D Center. All three still lead the company today with Lei Jun as CEO. Xiaomi and their CEO has a huge following in China and a very dedicated loyal fan base. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company trades at a P/E of 23 and a share price of 28.6 HKD (~3.69 USD). The price to earnings is pretty typical for a tech stock but I think the benefits in profit of Xiaomi&amp;#39;s strategy and investments are yet to be seen. I began buying up a few months ago and just doubled my investment after the earnings report. I will continue to buy in over atleast the next year and truly think this is a case of a company working hard for the future and with the right strategy. I saw the same patterns in Microsoft 6 years ago when Sadya Nedella took over and that position I&amp;#39;m up over 500%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know what you think and if you feel like there is anything you feel like I need to address. I&amp;#39;m really bullish on this company and it helps balance my portfolio with exposure towards Asia. I know Chinese stocks can be effy and at least for me it was also quite the challenge to find a brokage where I could buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation can be good, bad or neutral. The logic behind this is pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If inflation is driven by productive growth, it is good because the economy is benefiting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If however, there is no real growth but money in circulation expands, than businesses will need to adjust their prices to match the stagnating purchasing power of consumers. This is bad because not everyone has the (pricing) power to adjust prices accordingly. In fact the people with the least pricing power are wage earners, hence an even bigger problem as people can&amp;#39;t afford to buy things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation can be much worse than this, but let&amp;#39;s focus on the current situation in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkvalue.co/reports-tools/inflation-dashboard&quot;&gt;https://www.thinkvalue.co/reports-tools/inflation-dashboard&lt;/a&gt; I try to illustrate visually where we are in regards to inflation. My main points are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflation is about to catch up with all the currency injecting the FED started doing in 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are at the beginning of the inflation &amp;quot;wave&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our inflation is NOT driven by growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wont schil for you to buy gold because there are also other investment strategies and commodities to look at, but if you didn&amp;#39;t get a chance, take a look at Damodaran&amp;#39;s recent video on inflation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vqmjgF3E4&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vqmjgF3E4&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know which asset classes have &lt;em&gt;historically&lt;/em&gt; performed best during inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I am not jumping on the gold wagon at least until I see next month&amp;#39;s CPI (release on 10th of June)&lt;/p&gt;

I am just wondering isn&amp;#39;t it almost the same thing as 100% VT? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not go 100% VT to save the broker fee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks for the response. However I would like to point out that the broker fee is inevitable for me as I am from South East Asia and invest through tradestation global (whitelabel of IBKR), I am paying 1.5usd per trade and no fractional share allowed. All the broker here has a fee and I can&amp;#39;t sign up for a Vanguard/fidelity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly there&amp;#39;s no capital gain tax in my country here. So I guess it doesn&amp;#39;t make much difference for me. The only benefit  for choosing VTI + VXUS is that I am able to customize the ratio of them when I feel like it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BarkBox is a spac that today approved the merger. The Ticker $stic will be $bark on June 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these subscription box companies get a bad reputation because there were so many grocery ones that lose billions for years and the pet ones made no money because all they did was get existing products and package them where the margins were horrible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, barkbox is different. They own all of the products they put in the box, we call that vertically integrated. Have a retail store and sell the products at target and other online and offline stores. So, given the higher Margins, vertical integration, new revenue channels and fast growth I think the valuation should be more expensive than chewy on a price to sales multiple. Lets not discount that the subscription model will evolve over time churn is around 5% to 6% which is excellent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company actually has a few revenue channels: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;buy subscription (you can customize as well), &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;add on products to the box, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dental (medical and preventative is new and will grow), &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;meal plan (sends you monthly box of daily meals; crazy but people/dogs can be picky about food), &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ecommerce/retail where they sell the products on amazon, pet stores etc. this is an interesting business because it is not just ecommerce or subscription because they own a lot of the products they sell as their brand where they have exclusive supplychain and distribution agreements. They also have licensing with plush toys with NBA (example). They realized customers are crazy and treat dogs like people so do stuff accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt they will sell clothes, costumers, more medical stuff like fleak tick products to help keep the customes within the ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceo is actually new started in september 2020 and has options priced at $16 a share. He came from amazon and ebay and before that consultant at infosys. I think the management hire was an excellent decision as it allows then to scale their ecommerce business and get new customers into the ecosystem via subscriptions or not. I see the subscription revenue as potentially amazon prime stuff where people will just fill it up with what they need and not just junk all the time and people will be happy with that and some add-ons here and there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pet business is a fantastic long-term business as boomers age, etc. strategy for this is to buy and either hold or sell when it hits $20 to $30 if there becomes too much hype. This range of valuation is based in Price to Sales. The bottom I used was 2 times given Its growth rate and almost double the gross margin of chewy and even pet supermarket stores. The guidance for this year has room for upside &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built a ten year model and see then becoming profitable by 2023, however, all of their cash flow is going into growing the business as I think they can sustain a 30% revenue per year for a few years. I do think there are some potential risks such that the Barkeats business could do poorly if the pricing is not competitive or people change the product mix of the box to less profitable products or cancel all together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in hearing your thoughts on this below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks gained on Friday, with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation, and a strong Weekly unemployment report. The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March&amp;#39;s stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed’s traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic&amp;#39;s grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “An episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won’t affect Federal Reserve policy because they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves.” Moreover, he said “For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.” In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn’t expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:&lt;/strong&gt; 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing claims, week ended May 15:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let&amp;#39;s be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday&quot;&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
