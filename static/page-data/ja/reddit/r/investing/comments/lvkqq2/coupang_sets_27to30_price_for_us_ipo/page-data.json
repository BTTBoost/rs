The company hadn’t revealed the initial public offering’s expected price range or number of shares in its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406838-coupang-files-for-1-billion-ipo?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">original filing</a> last month.</li>\n<li>At $27 to $30 a share, Coupang would see a $46B to $51B market cap. That’s way up from a $9B valuation seen when the company last staged a private fundraising round in 2018.</li>\n<li>Coupang was founded in 2010 by Harvard Business School dropout Bom Kim, and is generally ranked as South Korea’s No. 1 e-commerce platform.</li>\n<li>The company aims to beat Amazon and other competitors with several unique features, such one-day and same-day delivery, and even what Coupang calls “Dawn Delivery.” That’s a program where orders placed by midnight arrive the next morning by 7 a.m.</li>\n<li>Coupang also boasts ecofriendly packaging, with 75% of deliveries coming without boxes. Instead, the company uses “eco-bags” that it picks up later and reuses.</li>\n<li>Lastly, Coupang promises “friction-free returns,” allowing customers to simply sign up for returns online and leave goods at their doors without boxing up and labeling items or paying for postage.</li>\n<li>“Our mission is to create a world where customers wonder: ‘How did I ever live without Coupang?’” the company wrote in its IPO prospectus.</li>\n<li>Coupang added in its S-1 that revenues have grown 400% in less than three years, from $900M in 2018’s first quarter to $3.8B in 2020’s fourth period.</li>\n<li>However, Coupang lost $474.9M in 2020, although that’s way down from the $1.1B of red ink it had in 2018.</li>\n<li>SoftBank’s Vision Fund was an early backer of the firm and will own about 37% of Coupang’s Class A stock following the IPO. Other pre-IPO investors include BlackRock and Greenoaks Capital Management.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvkqq2/coupang_sets_27to30_price_for_us_ipo/","title":"Coupang sets $27-to-$30 price for U.S. IPO","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"March 02, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-02T17:39:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-02 17:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"b9aea7e3-c976-5dd1-a14b-e4f994fc1891","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvkqq2/coupang_sets_27to30_price_for_us_ipo/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lvkqq2/coupang_sets_27to30_price_for_us_ipo/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"Gangy1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gangy1","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Gangy1","score":48,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Coupang将美国IPO的价格定为27美元至30美元。","the_new_excerpt":" *韩国电子商务巨头Coupang(CPNG)\n   [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPNG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link])\n   预计其即将在美国上市的热销产品定价为每股27美元至30美元，有可能\n   筹集36亿美金和...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Coupang將美國IPO的價格定爲27美元至30美元。","the_new_excerpt":" *韓國電子商務巨頭Coupang(CPNG)\n   [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPNG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link])\n   預計其即將在美國上市的熱銷產品定價爲每股27美元至30美元，有可能\n   籌集36億美金和...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ee086506-84a3-5a7c-8f8a-cd3d9597e17e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw30uk/every_time_i_buy_more_gme/","title":"Every time I buy more GME","date":"March 02, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"每次我买更多的GME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"每次我買更多的GME","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-bd8ab89a-115d-5075-b13f-de1875869a93","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvz261/boomer_hfs_trying_to_tell_us_to_sell_gme/","title":"Boomer HFs trying to tell us to sell GME","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Boomer HFs试图告诉我们出售GME。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"Boomer HFs試圖告訴我們出售GME。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-b9aea7e3-c976-5dd1-a14b-e4f994fc1891","previousId":"RedditPost-ee086506-84a3-5a7c-8f8a-cd3d9597e17e","nextId":"RedditPost-bd8ab89a-115d-5075-b13f-de1875869a93","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/lvkqq2/coupang_sets_27to30_price_for_us_ipo/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
