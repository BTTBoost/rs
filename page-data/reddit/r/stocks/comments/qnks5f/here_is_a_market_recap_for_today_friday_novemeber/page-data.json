This is a great sign given labor market imbalances caused by the pandemic have been a focal point for market participants. </p>\n\n<p>According to the US Labor Department, the pace of employment greatly improved after two disappointing months, with the report citing declining coronavirus cases and increased demand for workers for the uptick. Here are the numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Change in non-farm payrolls, October:</strong> +531,000 vs. +450,000 expected, and a great improvement over the +194,000 job added in September</li>\n<li><strong>Unemployment rate:</strong> 4.6% vs. 4.7% expected, 4.8% in September </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>During a press conference, President Joe Biden said of the Labor report, “Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. In this historically strong recovery, unemployment has fallen again today,” President Joe Biden said during a press conference on Friday.”</p>\n\n<p>Though payrolls have grown every month so far in 2021, the economy remains more than 4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels following plunges in employment between March and April of 2020. And the civilian labor force was still down by nearly 3 million individuals compared to February 2020 as of October. </p>\n\n<p>Earlier in the week, as was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shares of Peloton (PTON) slid more than 30% after the company reported disappointing earnings.</li>\n<li>Amazon (AMZN) is seeking approval from U.S. communications regulators to deploy more than 4,500 additional satellites as part of the company&#39;s effort to deliver broadband internet to areas around the world that lack high-speed service. Amazon (AMZN) said in its filing the satellites &quot;will serve households, hospitals, businesses, government agencies, and other organizations around the world, including in geographic areas where reliable broadband remains lacking.&quot;</li>\n<li>According to the Mayor of Markham, Ontario, Tesla (TSLA) plans to open a factory to produce battery manufacturing equipment. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frankscarpitti/status/1456335788170481673\">Mayor Frank Scarpitti said in a Tweet</a> “I’m delighted to share that Tesla Canada is joining our already robust automotive and technology ecosystem by locating a manufacturing facility in the City of Markham,”</li>\n<li>EV start-up Rivian, which has the backing of Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motors (F), is set to go public next week at an estimated valuation of $53 billion. The company will benefit from having Amazon buying a bunch of electric vans, but the valuation seems rich in my humble opinion</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that price target upgrades are written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Apple (AAPL) price target raised by Fundamental Research from $164 to $165 at Buy.
