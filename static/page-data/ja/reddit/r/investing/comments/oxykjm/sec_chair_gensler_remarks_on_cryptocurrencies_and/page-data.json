As of Monday, this asset class purportedly is worth about $1.6 trillion, with 77 tokens worth at least $1 billion each and 1,600 with at least a $1 million market capitalization.[4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>/</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We already live in an age of digital public monies — the dollar, euro, sterling, yen, yuan. If that wasn’t obvious before the pandemic, it has become eminently clear over the last year that we increasingly transact online.</p>\n\n<p>Such public fiat monies fulfill the three functions of money: a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.</p>\n\n<p>No single crypto asset, though, broadly fulfills all the functions of money.</p>\n\n<p>Primarily, crypto assets provide digital, scarce vehicles for speculative investment. Thus, in that sense, one can say they are highly speculative stores of value.</p>\n\n<p>These assets haven’t been used much as a unit of account.</p>\n\n<p>We also haven’t seen crypto used much as a medium of exchange. To the extent that it is used as such, it’s often to skirt our laws with respect to anti-money laundering, sanctions, and tax collection. It also can enable extortion via ransomware, as we recently saw with Colonial Pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>With the advent of the internet age and the movement from physical money to digital money several decades ago, nations around the globe layered various public policy goals over our digital public money system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>/</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The SEC has a three-part mission — to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets in between them. We focus on financial stability as well. But at our core, we’re about investor protection.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to invest in a digital, scarce, speculative store of value, that’s fine. Good-faith actors have been speculating on the value of gold and silver for thousands of years.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West.</p>\n\n<p>This asset class is rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications. There’s a great deal of hype and spin about how crypto assets work. In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced, and complete information.</p>\n\n<p>If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.</p>\n\n<p>First, many of these tokens are offered and sold as securities.</p>\n\n<p>There’s actually a lot of clarity on that front. In the 1930s, Congress established the definition of a security, which included about 20 items, like stock, bonds, and notes. One of the items is an investment contract.</p>\n\n<p>The following decade, the Supreme Court took up the definition of an investment contract. This case said an investment contract exists when “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”[6] The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed this Howey Test.</p>\n\n<p>Further, this is but one of many ways we determine whether tokens must comply with the federal securities laws.</p>\n\n<p>I think former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said it well when he testified in 2018: “To the extent that digital assets like [initial coin offerings, or ICOs] are securities — and I believe every ICO I have seen is a security — we have jurisdiction, and our federal securities laws apply.”[7]</p>\n\n<p>I find myself agreeing with Chairman Clayton. You see, generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there’s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects. I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.</p>\n\n<p>This leaves prices open to manipulation. This leaves investors vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the SEC has brought dozens of actions in this area,[8] prioritizing token-related cases involving fraud or other significant harm to investors. We haven’t yet lost a case.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there are initiatives by a number of platforms to offer crypto tokens or other products that are priced off of the value of securities and operate like derivatives.</p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake: It doesn’t matter whether it’s a stock token, a stable value token backed by securities, or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities. These products are subject to the securities laws and must work within our securities regime.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve urged staff to continue to protect investors in the case of unregistered sales of securities.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I’d like to discuss crypto trading platforms, lending platforms, and other “decentralized finance” (DeFi) platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The world of crypto finance now has platforms where people can trade tokens and other venues where people can lend tokens. I believe these platforms not only can implicate the securities laws; some platforms also can implicate the commodities laws and the banking laws.</p>\n\n<p>A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, unlike other trading markets, where investors go through an intermediary like the New York Stock Exchange, people can trade on crypto trading platforms without a broker — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>Further, while many overseas platforms state they don’t allow U.S. investors, there are allegations that some unregulated foreign exchanges facilitate trading by U.S. traders who are using virtual private networks, or VPNs.[9]</p>\n\n<p>The American public is buying, selling, and lending crypto on these trading, lending, and DeFi platforms, and there are significant gaps in investor protection.</p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws they have to register with the Commission unless they meet an exemption.</p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake: If a lending platform is offering securities, it also falls into SEC jurisdiction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>/</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before I conclude, I’d like to note we have taken and will continue to take our authorities as far as they go.</p>\n\n<p>Certain rules related to crypto assets are well-settled. The test to determine whether a crypto asset is a security is clear.</p>\n\n<p>There are some gaps in this space, though: We need additional Congressional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks. We also need more resources to protect investors in this growing and volatile sector.</p>\n\n<p>We stand ready to work closely with Congress, the Administration, our fellow regulators, and our partners around the world to close some of these gaps.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, the legislative priority should center on crypto trading, lending, and DeFi platforms. Regulators would benefit from additional plenary authority to write rules for and attach guardrails to crypto trading and lending.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, large parts of the field of crypto are sitting astride of — not operating within — regulatory frameworks that protect investors and consumers, guard against illicit activity, ensure for financial stability, and yes, protect national security.</p>\n\n<p>Standing astride isn’t a sustainable place to be. For those who want to encourage innovations in crypto, I’d like to note that financial innovations throughout history don’t long thrive outside of our public policy frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of finance is trust. And at the heart of trust in markets is investor protection. If this field is going to continue, or reach any of its potential to be a catalyst for change, we better bring it into public policy frameworks.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know when Gensler was appointed there was much hope that he would take a very soft line on crypto markets, it would seem that he is laying out firm intention at this point to pursue fraudulent and misleading offers heavily.  Obviously nobody knows what this will look like in practice, but I&#39;m sure anyone who&#39;s been paying attention to that space long enough has seen a few coins that ended up being scams of some sort.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/oxykjm/sec_chair_gensler_remarks_on_cryptocurrencies_and/","title":"SEC Chair Gensler remarks on Cryptocurrencies, and their potential qualification as securities","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-04T21:21:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-04 21:21","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"498e1ddb-a9fd-54c5-af3f-9a39bf9da25e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oxykjm/sec_chair_gensler_remarks_on_cryptocurrencies_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/oxykjm/sec_chair_gensler_remarks_on_cryptocurrencies_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"MasterCookSwag","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/MasterCookSwag","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"MasterCookSwag","score":245,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"米証券取引委員会（SEC）のゲンスラー委員長、暗号通貨とその証券化の可能性について発言","the_new_excerpt":"正直なところ、ここにいる多くの人が暗号を重視しているにもかかわらず、誰もこれを投稿していないことに少し驚いています。\nおそらく、反政府を重視する暗号コミュニティのメンバーにとっては、あまり良いニュースではないと思われるからです。\nおそらく、反政府を重視する暗号コミュニティのメンバーにとっては、良いニュースではないように思えるからでしょう。\n\nリンク\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"美国证券交易委员会主席Gensler就加密货币及其作为证券的潜在资格发表讲话","the_new_excerpt":"老实说，对于这里的许多人可能关注加密货币，我有点惊讶没有人\n我有点惊讶，因为这似乎不是一个好消息，对于更多的\n反政府的加密货币社区成员来说，这似乎不是一个好消息。\n\n链接。\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"美國證券交易委員會主席Gensler就加密貨幣及其作爲證券的潛在資格發表講話","the_new_excerpt":"老實說，對於這裏的許多人可能關注加密貨幣，我有點驚訝沒有人\n我有點驚訝，因爲這似乎不是一個好消息，對於更多的\n反政府的加密貨幣社區成員來說，這似乎不是一個好消息。\n\n鏈接。\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-20c07fc8-dafe-529e-a827-f162e16b1802","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/cvs-health-raises-wages-cuts-education-requirements-amid-labor-shortage.html\n\nCVS Health said it is raising wages for employees and eliminating education\nrequirements for job candidates as it competes for workers.\n\nRetailers and restaurants have struggled to fill…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oxtbmr/cvs_health_boosts_pay_cuts_education_requirements/","title":"CVS Health boosts pay, cuts education requirements as retailers compete for workers","date":"August 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"CVSヘルス社が給与を引き上げ、教育要件を引き下げ、小売業者が労働者獲得を競う","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/cvs-health-raises-wages-cuts-education-requirements-amid-labor-shortage.html\n\nCVSヘルス社は、従業員の賃金を引き上げ、求職者の学歴要件を撤廃することで\nCVSヘルス社は、従業員の賃金を引き上げ、求職者の学歴要件を撤廃し、労働者の獲得競争を行っています。\n\n小売店やレストランは、従業員の確保に苦労しています。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"零售商争夺员工，CVS Health提高薪酬，削减教育要求","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/cvs-health-raises-wages-cuts-education-requirements-amid-labor-shortage.html\n\nCVS Health表示，它正在提高员工的工资，并取消对求职者的教育要求。\n它正在提高员工的工资，并取消对求职者的教育要求，因为它正在争夺工人。\n\n零售商和餐馆一直在努力填补...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"零售商爭奪員工，CVS Health提高薪酬，削減教育要求","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/cvs-health-raises-wages-cuts-education-requirements-amid-labor-shortage.html\n\nCVS Health表示，它正在提高員工的工資，並取消對求職者的教育要求。\n它正在提高員工的工資，並取消對求職者的教育要求，因爲它正在爭奪工人。\n\n零售商和餐館一直在努力填補...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-4ad0dc72-d630-57c0-8b54-9187067b6037","excerpt":"Now at the price point I did not expect until the very end of the year if not\n2022.
