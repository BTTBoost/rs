I cannot divulge my name, but ask me anything else and I will try to prove I&#39;m not bullshitting.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, today we saw Bloomberg, CNBC, and Reuters simultaneously blast glowing articles about how Plotkin made 20% in Feb. Every story came out at the same time and cited &quot;sources&quot; or &quot;people familiar with the matter,&quot; but barely had any other details. This is typical of story planted by PR.</p>\n\n<p>PRs will tell every reporter on the street &quot;hey I got a tip for you but don&#39;t publish until Wednesday after market.&quot; And every reporter thinks they have an exclusive and types up the article. And then PR gets the most bang for the buck as every outlet publishes the same bullshit at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>I would know. I deal with Melvin&#39;s cunty COO David Kurd when I was reporting on them. This is his usual tactic.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re lying about these gains. Probably not. Maybe they fudged some mark-to-market valuations to show a good month. But the bigger takeaways is that Melvin is desperate to improve their image. They are weak. We are strong. Fuck Plotkin and fuck Kurd. Let&#39;s keep digging into their positions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5ar9pyodcxk61.png?width=1062&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=601dba7f57ef22a704dd52ee84ed8415ab762efb\">PR bullshit and lazy journalists</a></p>\n\n<p>PS: I&#39;m surprised people don&#39;t mention <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/saccapital-probe-trader-idUSL1E8NIBA420121219\">this</a> about Plotkin.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxatg6/melvin_planted_stories_about_their_feb_performance/","title":"Melvin planted stories about their Feb performance","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T07:22:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 07:22","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"645740b5-edf1-520e-a8da-94f7aff7324f","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxatg6/melvin_planted_stories_about_their_feb_performance/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxatg6/melvin_planted_stories_about_their_feb_performance/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/JE5v1BJsIlc2DiVs1rwqi6CLE49u9lcH1SVOoMRTF3k.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=32fa31b88dc576e4e7744d0623104c925c11ecf8","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"burner20170218","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/burner20170218","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"burner20170218","score":10417,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"梅尔文种植的故事，他们2月的表现","the_new_excerpt":"猩猩们好，我是彭博社的前记者。我不能透露我的名字，但是\n问我其他的事情，我会努力证明我不是在胡说八道。\n\n总之，今天我们看到彭博社、CNBC和路透社同时炮轰发光的。\n关于Plotkin如何在2月赚了20%的文章，每篇报道都是在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"梅爾文種植的故事，他們2月的表現","the_new_excerpt":"猩猩們好，我是彭博社的前記者。我不能透露我的名字，但是\n問我其他的事情，我會努力證明我不是在胡說八道。\n\n總之，今天我們看到彭博社、CNBC和路透社同時炮轟發光的。\n關於Plotkin如何在2月賺了20%的文章，每篇報道都是在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-0d8f3818-7dc9-5525-9971-fcb9715b7cbb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx9jpj/we_are_all_brothers_retardsbuy_hold/","title":"We are all brothers retards...buy & hold","date":"March 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我们都是兄弟弱智......买入并持有。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們都是兄弟弱智......買入並持有。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-e9d8bdf6-2015-5541-9079-1838e7da594e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxe2pv/lose_enough_money_with_fidelity_and_theyll_send/","title":"Lose enough money with Fidelity and they'll send you a letter perfect for framing","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 04, 2021","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"如果你在富达公司输够了钱，他们就会给你寄一封信，用来装裱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你在富達公司輸夠了錢，他們就會給你寄一封信，用來裝裱","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-645740b5-edf1-520e-a8da-94f7aff7324f","previousId":"RedditPost-0d8f3818-7dc9-5525-9971-fcb9715b7cbb","nextId":"RedditPost-e9d8bdf6-2015-5541-9079-1838e7da594e","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxatg6/melvin_planted_stories_about_their_feb_performance/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
