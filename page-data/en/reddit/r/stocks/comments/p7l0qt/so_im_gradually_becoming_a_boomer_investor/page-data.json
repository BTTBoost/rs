I&#39;ve come close to my position nearly doubling in value, and then lost all my profits in February. Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.</p>\n\n<p>I have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I&#39;ve made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it&#39;s made me a smarter investor.</p>\n\n<p>I recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn&#39;t even worry me. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. </p>\n\n<p>I sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it&#39;s way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I&#39;m not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)</p>\n\n<p>I made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what&#39;s going on with CCP recently.</p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.</p>\n\n<p>I am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.</p>\n\n<p>My advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I&#39;d keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can&#39;t shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.</p>\n\n<p>Love to hear from you guys and don&#39;t feel like you can&#39;t dm me or comment some questions..</p>\n\n<p>BTW I&#39;m not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn&#39;t signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well. If this takes place.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p7l0qt/so_im_gradually_becoming_a_boomer_investor/","title":"So I'm gradually becoming a boomer investor.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"August 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-20T02:04:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-20 02:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"f72b3a29-f3c0-5bf0-a6db-74500542f07d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p7l0qt/so_im_gradually_becoming_a_boomer_investor/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p7l0qt/so_im_gradually_becoming_a_boomer_investor/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Warren_MuffClit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Warren_MuffClit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Warren_MuffClit","score":90,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"だから、だんだんと団塊の世代の投資家になっていく。","the_new_excerpt":"この13ヶ月間、私はずっと成長に重きを置いてきました。自分の立場が危うくなったことも\n2月にはすべての利益を失いました。\n6月には再び上昇しましたが、最近は再び収支均衡に近い状態にまで落ち込みました。\n\nこの1年で多くのことを学びました。それは、成長と衰退の関係です。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"所以我逐渐成为一个潮人投资者。","the_new_excerpt":"整整一年，大约13个月以来，我一直在大力发展。我已经接近于\n我的头寸价值几乎翻倍，然后在2月失去了所有的利润。\n在6月，我又回升了，然后最近又崩溃了，接近收支平衡。\n\n在这一年里，我学到了很多东西。很多关于增长与发展的知识。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"所以我逐漸成爲一個潮人投資者。","the_new_excerpt":"整整一年，大約13個月以來，我一直在大力發展。我已經接近於\n我的頭寸價值幾乎翻倍，然後在2月失去了所有的利潤。\n在6月，我又回升了，然後最近又崩潰了，接近收支平衡。\n\n在這一年裏，我學到了很多東西。很多關於增長與發展的知識。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1428389997753819140","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1428389997753819140","title":"All Weather portfolio https://t.co/mULx5V6NyJ","date":"August 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"オールウェザーポートフォリオ https://t.co/mULx5V6NyJ","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"全天候组合https://t.co/mULx5V6NyJ","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"全天候組合https://t.co/mULx5V6NyJ","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-1243b5ee-3191-50f0-9cc0-f3fbc0c6e177","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p7qgao/my_life_is_ruined_im_officially_bankrupt_tomorrow/","title":"My life is ruined Im officially bankrupt tomorrow lost 500k Since June","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 20, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私は人生を台無しにされました 私は明日正式に破産します 6月から500kを失いました","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我的生活被毁了 我明天就正式破产了 自6月以来损失了50万","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的生活被毀了 我明天就正式破產了 自6月以來損失了50萬","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-f72b3a29-f3c0-5bf0-a6db-74500542f07d","previousId":"TweetPost-1428389997753819140","nextId":"RedditPost-1243b5ee-3191-50f0-9cc0-f3fbc0c6e177","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/p7l0qt/so_im_gradually_becoming_a_boomer_investor/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
