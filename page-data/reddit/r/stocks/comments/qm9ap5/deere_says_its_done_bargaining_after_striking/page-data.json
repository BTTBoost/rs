We don’t have a better offer to provide. This is it.”</p>\n\n<p>Deere will continue operating its U.S. plants with nonunion employees, Mr. Howze said, and it is considering sourcing replacement parts and machinery from its overseas plants.</p>\n\n<p>Union leaders and negotiators for the striking Deere workers are discussing their next steps, a UAW spokesman said. The union had no specific response to Mr. Howze’s assertion that Deere won’t negotiate on a third offer with bigger raises.</p>\n\n<p>The strike at Deere, the largest U.S. farm equipment manufacturer by sales, is set to head into its third week at a time when tractor and combine sales have been booming, and farmers are planning purchases for the coming crop year. Some farmers worry that an extended strike at the Moline, Ill.-based manufacturer could deepen shortages of new equipment and drive up prices for already-scarce used equipment, with factory production currently constrained due to a lack of semiconductor chips and other components.</p>\n\n<p>The contract rejected Tuesday would have given more than 10,000 striking Deere employees an immediate 10% increase in pay, plus an $8,500 bonus for each worker and additional 5% pay raises in 2023 and 2025. That proposal followed a previous contract offer rejected by Deere workers Oct. 10.</p>\n\n<p>Deere shares settled 3.5% lower Wednesday, with U.S. stock indexes generally moving higher.</p>\n\n<p>Employees said Deere should have provided bigger raises and benefit expansions, given a surge in the company’s farm and construction equipment sales, and the pay increases other employers have offered this year to recruit workers. Deere workers went on strike Oct. 14, the first walkout at the company since 1986.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Howze said the company negotiators were willing to consider employees’ demand for better raises and benefits after the first contract offer failed by a wide margin. But he said the company won’t go any higher than the second offer, which he said would cost Deere an additional $3.5 billion over the life of the contract.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s no benefit to be gained by staying out,” Mr. Howze said, referring to strikers holding out for a better deal by prolonging the walkout. “We want to get people back to work.”</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Howze said Deere executives were encouraged by the level of support for the second offer after 90% of the voters reportedly turned down the first deal. He declined to elaborate on how Deere is maintaining operations with nonunion employees, but said some U.S. employees are working around the clock at some sites.</p>\n\n<p>Employees of Deere have said they felt empowered to push for better terms from due to the current strength in the company’s business, versus negotiations in past years when equipment sales were slower, or general economic conditions weaker. For the full fiscal year, Deere has projected about $5.8 billion in income, compared with $2.8 billion in 2020 and $3.3 billion in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Rising demand for agricultural commodities and poor weather in North and South America have tightened crop supplies over the past year, and driven a rebound in the farm economy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w\">www.w</a> sj.com/articles/deere-says-its-done-bargaining-after-striking-workers-reject-second-contract-offer-11635976220</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qm9ap5/deere_says_its_done_bargaining_after_striking/","title":"Deere Says It’s Done Bargaining After Striking Workers Reject Second Contract Offer","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-04T03:27:16.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-04 03:27","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qm9ap5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qm9ap5/deere_says_its_done_bargaining_after_striking/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qm9ap5/deere_says_its_done_bargaining_after_striking/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"rockinoutwith2","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/rockinoutwith2","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"rockinoutwith2","score":884,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Deere社、ストライキ中の労働者が2回目の契約提示を拒否した後、交渉を終了したと発表。","the_new_excerpt":"Deere DE -3.45% & Co.は、火曜日に行われた新契約承認のための2回目の投票が失敗した後も、ストライキ中の労働者への提案を引き上げないと発表しました。\n新契約を批准するための2回目の投票が失敗に終わったため、同社はストライキ中の労働者への提案を引き上げないだろう、と同社幹部が語った。\n\n農機具・建設機械メーカーの最高管理責任者であるマーク・ハウゼ氏は\n同社の最高管理責任者であるマーク・ハウゼ氏によると、同社は最高かつ最終的な提案を...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"罢工工人拒绝第二份合同提议后，迪尔公司称已完成谈判","the_new_excerpt":"迪尔公司(Deere DE -3.45%)不会提高对罢工工人的报价。\n公司一位高管表示，在周二批准新合同的第二次投票失败后，公司不会提高对罢工工人的报价。\n\n这家农业和建筑设备制造商的首席行政官Marc Howze表示，该公司已经提出了最佳和最后的报价。\n农场和建筑设备制造商的首席行政官Marc Howze表示，该公司已提出其最佳和最后的报价。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"罷工工人拒絕第二份合同提議後，迪爾公司稱已完成談判","the_new_excerpt":"迪爾公司(Deere DE -3.45%)不會提高對罷工工人的報價。\n公司一位高管表示，在週二批准新合同的第二次投票失敗後，公司不會提高對罷工工人的報價。\n\n這家農業和建築設備製造商的首席行政官Marc Howze表示，該公司已經提出了最佳和最後的報價。\n農場和建築設備製造商的首席行政官Marc Howze表示，該公司已提出其最佳和最後的報價。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qm3hiv","excerpt":"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/squares-cash-app-opens-up-to-teens-ages-13-to-17-with-parental-oversight/amp/\n\nAmid a growing number of banking apps aimed at teens, Square Inc.’s Cash App\ntoday is broadening its reach by making its payments app available to younger\nteens between the ages of 13 and…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qm3hiv/squares_cash_app_opens_up_to_teens_ages_13_to_17/","title":"Square’s Cash App opens up to teens ages 13 to 17 with parental oversight","date":"November 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"スクエアのキャッシュアプリ、保護者の監視下で13歳から17歳のティーンエイジャーに公開","the_new_excerpt":"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/squares-cash-app-opens-up-to-teens-ages-13-to-17-with-parental-oversight/amp/\n\nティーンエイジャー向けの銀行アプリが増えている中、Square Inc.のCash App\nは、13歳から20歳までの若い世代にも決済アプリを提供することで、その可能性を広げています。\n今日、Square Inc.の「Cash App」は、13歳から20歳までの若い世代が利用できるようになりました。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Square的现金应用在家长的监督下向13至17岁的青少年开放","the_new_excerpt":"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/squares-cash-app-opens-up-to-teens-ages-13-to-17-with-parental-oversight/amp/\n\n在越来越多的针对青少年的银行应用程序中，Square公司的Cash App\n今天正在扩大其影响力，将其支付应用程序提供给更年轻的用户。\n13岁至19岁的青少年。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"Square的現金應用在家長的監督下向13至17歲的青少年開放","the_new_excerpt":"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/squares-cash-app-opens-up-to-teens-ages-13-to-17-with-parental-oversight/amp/\n\n在越來越多的針對青少年的銀行應用程序中，Square公司的Cash App\n今天正在擴大其影響力，將其支付應用程序提供給更年輕的用戶。\n13歲至19歲的青少年。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qm61io","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qm61io/wsb_in_a_nutshell/","title":"WSB in a nutshell","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 04, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WSBを一言で言うと","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"简言之，WSB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"簡言之，WSB","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qm9ap5","previousId":"RedditPost-qm3hiv","nextId":"RedditPost-qm61io","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qm9ap5/deere_says_its_done_bargaining_after_striking/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
