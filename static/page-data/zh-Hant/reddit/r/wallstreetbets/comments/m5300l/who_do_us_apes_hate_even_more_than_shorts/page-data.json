They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year - which further exposed the company for misleading investors and caused the stock to continue crashing down.</p>\n\n<p>They take large short positions in companies, put out extensive and detailed hit-pieces against them, induce panic (causing people to sell), and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don’t care if they are right or wrong on their “research” because they will profit on their short position regardless.</p>\n\n<p>Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float – these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their “reports”).</p>\n\n<p>Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM – to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where do they get their research?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the million-dollar question.</p>\n\n<p>They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us.</p>\n\n<p>In their most recent attack against <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/\">GM-backed Lordstown Motors</a> on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on “conversations they had” with undisclosed “former employees” of the company.</p>\n\n<p>Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired.</p>\n\n<p>That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don’t imagine she’s going to have too many nice things to say.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let’s be clear. This is no Nikola.</p>\n\n<p>Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html\">6.2 million square foot facility</a> and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a “quiet-period” right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a <a href=\"https://video.foxnews.com/v/6237427669001#sp=show-clips\">video last week</a> that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders.</p>\n\n<p>Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a <a href=\"https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/is-lordstown-motors-a-mirage-a-stock-market-research-firm-just-published-a-deep-dive-into-the-voltage-valley-leader-3539242\">“thorough” statement</a> and will “absolutely” be refuting the Hindenburg Research report.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. <em>Disclosure:</em> I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, I’ll let you be the judge – should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks?</p>\n\n<p>What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully <em>prevent it from happening to you in the future</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>I’ll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A 5-man “research firm” ran out of an apartment in New York <strong>or</strong> a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious.</p>\n\n<p>Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn’t close out their short positions get burned this week – and it begins tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>$RIDE or die baby! #MadeInAmerica</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hindenburg Research attacked a company based out of a small town in Ohio that is producing electric pick-up trucks for the hard-working men and women of this country. The American dream is all about building a company from the ground-up that will make the world a better place – for Lordstown Motors, that means bringing the first <strong>full-size</strong> electric pick-up to market this September. The goal of this post is to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and refute their allegations into Lordstown Motors.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Enjoy the wild $RIDE this week - earnings call on Wednesday is going to be rocket fuel 🚀 🚀 for us to burn the shorts.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5300l/who_do_us_apes_hate_even_more_than_shorts/","title":"Who do us apes hate even more than shorts?","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T09:39:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 09:39","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"c587e9fa-29e4-597c-b747-f504eb4f86c7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5300l/who_do_us_apes_hate_even_more_than_shorts/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5300l/who_do_us_apes_hate_even_more_than_shorts/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/fcO5Pbr591dgt6Dqt5A-Ruev74c_ZUuKg2W2kLB6j10.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=403f4e7440cbcf9e244c78701265a6c88da87453","video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"DawgPound98","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DawgPound98","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"DawgPound98","score":1645,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我们猿人比短裤还恨谁？","the_new_excerpt":"兴登堡研究--如果你还不恨他们，你很快就会恨，当他们\n攻击你的一个持股。\n\n谁是 \"兴登堡研究\"？\n\n\"兴登堡研究 \"是一家5人的小店。\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055]\n基于一个公寓在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們猿人比短褲還恨誰？","the_new_excerpt":"興登堡研究--如果你還不恨他們，你很快就會恨，當他們\n攻擊你的一個持股。\n\n誰是 \"興登堡研究\"？\n\n\"興登堡研究 \"是一家5人的小店。\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055]\n基於一個公寓在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-357470e0-317e-595f-bf36-35f1b811442f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m57hcq/discussion_over_the_last_week_gme_still_on_top_by/","title":"Discussion over the last week, GME still on top by a long shot.
