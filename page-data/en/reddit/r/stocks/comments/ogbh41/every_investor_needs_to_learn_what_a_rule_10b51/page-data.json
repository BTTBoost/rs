They know the company is going to tank...SELL SELL SELL!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>But this panic is from misguided investors (or people purposely trying to sew doubt), and not actually how it works at all in a lot of cases. Most people are aware that company insiders are beholden to very strict regulations regarding insider trading. In the most simple terms, they are not allowed to trade their company stock (buy shares, sell shares, execute options, anything) based on  MNPI (Material Non Public Information)...ie they can&#39;t make any moves based on any important information about the company that the public does not have.</p>\n\n<p>The rule outlining prosecution of these insider trading violations is known as SEC Rule 10b5-1.</p>\n\n<p>The inherent problem is that this rule creates somewhat of a paradox. Company insiders obviously always know more than the public, so almost any trade they make could potentially be considered an insider trade. So how do executives trade their shares without violating the rule?</p>\n\n<p>To get around this risk, many company executives are typically asked to sign what are known as 10b5-1 plans. This is essentially an agreement between themselves and a brokerage firm, outlining the exact price minimums they want to sell shares at, along with the volume and frequency. These plans are typically entered BEFORE shares are even issued, or pre-IPO if its a newly public company.</p>\n\n<p>The plan does 3 things (<a href=\"https://ccbjournal.com/articles/the-10b5-1-plan-what-executives-need-to-know\">https://ccbjournal.com/articles/the-10b5-1-plan-what-executives-need-to-know</a>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specifies the number of shares to be traded, along with the price and date of the purchase or sale; or</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Includes a written formula, algorithm or computer program for determining the number of shares to be traded and the price and the date of the trade; or</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Transfers trading authority to a third party not in possession of MNPI and prohibits the insider from exercising any subsequent influence over how, when or whether to make purchases or sales.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The executive signs the agreement...and the brokerage carries out the trades based on the pre-determined instructions. The insider has no influence over the future sales of their stock.</p>\n\n<p>At the bottom of form 4 filings in the &quot;Explanation of Responses&quot; section, look for a note that says something like: &quot; (1) The sales reported in this Form 4 were effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the Reporting Person&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If you see that note, it means that insider has a 10b5-1 plan, the sale was pre-determined well in advance, and has 0 to do with the executive&#39;s sentiment towards the company.  It is 100% normal for executives to take share profit periodically to supplement their income, especially post-IPO...and means nothing about performance.</p>\n\n<p>Now, these plans aren&#39;t bulletproof, and can be modified or suspended. But if the insider has any MNPI, they can get in deep shit if they&#39;re caught doing something shady.</p>\n\n<p>Over 57% of S&amp;P companies are under such a plan, and most new IPOs I see are doing them.</p>\n\n<p>10b5-1 Plan...learn it, love it, and use it to tell FUDsters to GTFO</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Here&#39;s some great simplified info about them: <a href=\"https://media2.mofo.com/documents/faq10b51.pdf\">https://media2.mofo.com/documents/faq10b51.pdf</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ogbh41/every_investor_needs_to_learn_what_a_rule_10b51/","title":"Every investor needs to learn what a rule 10b5-1 plan is and stop panicking every time a company insider sells some shares!","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-09T05:20:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-09 05:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"3ba3a31f-aa1a-571a-8b2f-2a71f64398c2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ogbh41/every_investor_needs_to_learn_what_a_rule_10b51/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ogbh41/every_investor_needs_to_learn_what_a_rule_10b51/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"notacluewhatodo","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/notacluewhatodo","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"notacluewhatodo","score":50,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"すべての投資家は、ルール10b5-1プランとは何かを学び、会社のインサイダーが株式を売却するたびにパニックに陥らないようにする必要があります。","the_new_excerpt":"このサイトや他の投資家フォーラムでよく見かけるFUDは、「会社の重役が株を売っているなんて！」というものです。\n会社の重役が株を売っている！」というものです。彼らは会社が大暴落することを知っています。\n売って売って売って！」というものです。\n\nしかし、このパニックは間違った投資家（あるいは意図的に疑惑を植え付けようとしている人）によるもので、実際にはどうなのかはわかりません。\nしかし、このパニックは見当違いの投資家（あるいは意図的に疑心暗鬼にさせようとする人）によるもので、実際には全く機能していません。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"每个投资者都需要了解什么是10b5-1规则计划，不要再在每次公司内部人员卖出一些股票时就惊慌失措!","the_new_excerpt":"我在这里和任何投资者论坛上看到的一些最常见的FUD是，\"OMG\n公司高管正在抛售股票! 他们知道该公司将\n坦克......卖掉，卖掉，卖掉！\"\n\n但这种恐慌是来自被误导的投资者（或者是故意要缝合的人\n疑问），实际上根本不是这样的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"每個投資者都需要了解什麼是10b5-1規則計劃，不要再在每次公司內部人員賣出一些股票時就驚慌失措!","the_new_excerpt":"我在這裏和任何投資者論壇上看到的一些最常見的FUD是，\"OMG\n公司高管正在拋售股票! 他們知道該公司將\n坦克......賣掉，賣掉，賣掉！\"\n\n但這種恐慌是來自被誤導的投資者（或者是故意要縫合的人\n疑問），實際上根本不是這樣的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-fda1267d-c39f-56bb-a746-c2c0015ed72f","excerpt":"Hello friends,\n\nAfter a year of trying to pick winners in the markets (and missing on quite a\nfew) I've decided to calm down and build around a diversified portfolio.
