The 14 are:</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>6G</strong>:  “The next generation of telecom networks will be needed in less than a  decade as data continues to grow exponentially and 5G reaches its upper  limit capacity.”</li>\n<li><strong>Brain Computer Interfaces</strong>:  “As we reach a point where humans are unable to keep up with computers  and AI, brain computer interfaces could help ‘level up’ humans with  computers. Shorter term, brain computer interfaces hold solutions for  paralyzed individuals and promise a new wave of innovation in gaming.”</li>\n<li><strong>Emotional Artificial Intelligence</strong>:  Also “known as &#39;Affective Computing&#39; and &#39;Cognitive Computing&#39; (it) is  designed to capture, analyze and respond to human emotions and simulate  human thoughts. EAI can potentially collect, analyze and respond to  completely new varieties of data and situations and predict or simulate  human thought, leading people to take action.”</li>\n<li><strong>Synthetic Biology</strong>:  “At its core, &#39;synbio&#39;, as the field is commonly referred to, takes  advantage of the vast diversity of nature to make biomolecules that  traditional chemistry cannot.”</li>\n<li><strong>Immortality</strong>:  “Traditionally, aging has not been viewed as a disease that can be  treated but this is changing. Actors in this space are increasingly  looking to tackle the hallmark of aging via pathways such as genomic  instability, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular  senescence among others.”</li>\n<li><strong>Bionic humans</strong>:  “This could be invasive (e.g. implants) or non-invasive (e.g.  exoskeleton). Biohacking is also an associated field which is  essentially applying DIY biology to boost oneself e.g. RFID chip in hand  for contactless payments.”</li>\n<li><strong>eVTOL</strong>:  “Electrical vertical take-off and landing vehicles that could provide an  alternative mobility transportation solution to outdated infrastructure  and overly stressed roads in urban settings.”</li>\n<li><strong>Wireless Electricity</strong>:  “As the IoT takes off, automating and creating near continuous charging  solutions could provide convenience for consumers, while solving  charging problems for the rollout of EVs and secure electricity supplies  for remote communities.”</li>\n<li><strong>Holograms</strong>: “A  technology capable of creating a simulated environment through light  imagery projections that will allow everyone to come together in one  virtual room, without having to leave their physical location.”</li>\n<li><strong>Metaverse</strong>:  “A future iteration of the Internet, made up of persistent, shared,  3D-shared spaces linked into a virtual universe. It could comprise  countless persistent virtual worlds that interoperate with one another,  as well as the physical world and transforming markets such as gaming,  retail, entertainment etc.”</li>\n<li><strong>Nextgen Batteries</strong>:  “Whilst lithium batteries are the major EV technology, this does not  necessarily need to stay true with alternatives such as solid state,  vanadium flow, sodium ion etc provide promising additional attributes.”</li>\n<li><strong>OceanTech</strong>:  “It seeks to answer: ‘How do we increase sustainability of the ocean  economy while harnessing its benefits?’ Solutions could include ocean  energy, land based aquaculture, and precision fishing using AI.”</li>\n<li><strong>Green Mining</strong>:  “Transitioning away from a carbon-intensive economy will mean moving to  a metal-intensive one. Green mining solutions like deep-sea mining,  agromining, mining of wastewater and asteroid mining could provide less  polluting and destructive solutions as the green economy’s thirst for  metals grows.”</li>\n<li><strong>Carbon Capture and Storage</strong>:  “All current zero-carbon pathways require some form of CO2 removal. CCS,  alongside other geoengineering solutions, could act as part of the  solution with long-term permanent removal of CO2 vs afforestation.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izsrvpss9WiY/v0/-1x-1.png\">https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izsrvpss9WiY/v0/-1x-1.png</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lower lifespan</strong>: The lifespan of S&amp;P 500 incumbents is shortening and by 2027 components could last just 12  years before being replaced, BofA says. For Next Tech to succeed, first  the innovation must have the potential to be economical, then it must  solve a key problem or improve quality of life, and finally, there must  be government support in some way. Risks to the 14 ideas include the  tech not being commercially scalable, prohibitive costs outweighing the  benefits and regulation limiting applicability.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ppcbyw/the_new_moonshot_technologies/","title":"The New Moonshot Technologies","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"September 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-16T16:36:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-16 16:36","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"ppcbyw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ppcbyw/the_new_moonshot_technologies/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ppcbyw/the_new_moonshot_technologies/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"GigaChadEnergy","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/GigaChadEnergy","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"GigaChadEnergy","score":70,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"新しいムーンショット技術","the_new_excerpt":"BofAグローバルリサーチは、152ページに及ぶ調査レポートを発表しました。\n私たちの生活を変え、世界的なメガトレンドの影響を加速させる可能性のある\nメガトレンドの影響を加速させる \"としています。これらの技術は、現在の市場規模が3,300億ドルで、2030年代には6.4兆ドルにまで成長する可能性があります。\nハイム・イスラエル率いる戦略家は、これらのテクノロジーの市場規模は現在3,300億ドルであり、2030年代には6.4兆ドルにまで拡大する可能性があると述べています。\"これらの...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"新的登月技术","the_new_excerpt":"博鳌亚洲论坛全球研究部发布了一份152页的研究报告，确定了14个 \"激进的\n技术，这些技术可能改变我们的生活并加速全球大趋势的影响。\n大趋势的影响\"。这些技术目前有3300亿美元的市场规模，到2030年可能增长到\n由哈伊姆-伊斯雷尔领导的战略家说，这些技术目前有3300亿美元的市场规模，到2030年代可能增长到64亿美元。\"这些...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"新的登月技術","the_new_excerpt":"博鰲亞洲論壇全球研究部發布了一份152頁的研究報告，確定了14個 \"激進的\n技術，這些技術可能改變我們的生活並加速全球大趨勢的影響。\n大趨勢的影響\"。這些技術目前有3300億美元的市場規模，到2030年可能增長到\n由哈伊姆-伊斯雷爾領導的戰略家說，這些技術目前有3300億美元的市場規模，到2030年代可能增長到64億美元。\"這些...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1438505257013706764","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1438505257013706764","title":"Thinking you’re late to crypto is like thinking you’re late to the internet in December 1999.","date":"September 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"暗号に出遅れたと思うのは、1999年12月にインターネットに出遅れたと思うようなものです。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"认为你对加密货币的看法晚了，就像认为你对1999年12月的互联网看法晚了一样。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"認爲你對加密貨幣的看法晚了，就像認爲你對1999年12月的互聯網看法晚了一樣。","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-ppdbm6","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppdbm6/reposted_cuz_im_a_retard_and_forgot_to_crop/","title":"Reposted cuz I'm a retard and forgot to crop","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 16, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"遅れていてトリミングするのを忘れたので、再投稿しました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"因为我是个弱智，忘了裁剪，所以转贴了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"因爲我是個弱智，忘了裁剪，所以轉貼了。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-ppcbyw","previousId":"TweetPost-1438505257013706764","nextId":"RedditPost-ppdbm6","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/ppcbyw/the_new_moonshot_technologies/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
