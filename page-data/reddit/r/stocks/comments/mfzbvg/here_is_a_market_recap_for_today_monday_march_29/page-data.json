After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. </p>\n\n<p>Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can&#39;t, the broker will dump the client&#39;s shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. </p>\n\n<p>The United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/\">in his first 100 days</a>. Before Biden&#39;s inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021). </p>\n\n<p>In other news, the Ever Given, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal, a critical artery in global trade, was finally dislodged. The week-long blockade cost roughly $9 billion a day in lost revenue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The data are<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html\"> expected to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs</a> — the most since October 2019 and the best the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>\n<li>Comcast (CMCSA) will now offer Disney+ and ESPN+ in its Xfinity platform.</li>\n<li>DraftKings (DKNG) and the World Wrestling Federation entered into an agreement to make the sports betting company the official gaming partner of the WWE.
