This is a multiple of about 50 times the current price. If the price happens to spike that high (it almost certainly won&#39;t), I&#39;ll get $100,000 per share. They&#39;re comfortable doing this, because they probably actually have the shares. Or they feel like they can get them when it happens.</p>\n\n<p>However, they are only willing to let me put a limit of about $250 per share for GME. This is a multiple of only 5x.</p>\n\n<p>They give errors for any attempt to put limit sells higher than this. Why are they treating GME limit sells differently from Google? I have a cash account. There should be no share lending going on. The broker should not be at risk for ANY limit I put on the sale of my shares.</p>\n\n<p>The only conclusion I have been able to draw from this is: They must not actually have all of our shares and are limiting their losses. Try it with any other stock: LIMITS ARE 50x, and as far as I can tell, have always been until GME.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: In my cash account:</p>\n\n<p>1) TD allows Google (and many other stocks) limit sell orders to be placed at about 50x the price.</p>\n\n<p>2) GME limit sell orders can be placed at only about 5x the price.</p>\n\n<p>What gives?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","title":"I strongly suspect that Schwab/Ameritrade does not actually have our GME shares.","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T09:42:06.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 09:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"6e1530d6-9262-5921-9d47-02bc742663dc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Fragsworth","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fragsworth","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Fragsworth","score":527,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-77e82b79-6442-54fa-a0bc-05845377d7c1","excerpt":"> What actually occurs in these cases is wealth transfer, often on a massive\n> scale.
