The collective output from those miners declined to 13.7 million ounces in 2020 from 15 million ounces in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Vinneth Bajaj, associate project manager at GlobalData, said: “After a strong first quarter in 2020, Newmont’s production was impacted by lower ore grades at the Ahafo, Yanacocha and Merian mines and the temporary suspension of the Cerro Negro, Yanacocha, Eleonore, Penasquito and Musselwhite mines between March and mid-May. In addition, the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie projects further reduced output.”</p>\n\n<p>Lockdowns imposed by governments impacted gold production last year</p>\n\n<p>For Barrick, several gold mines were forced to cease operations temporarily due to the government lockdowns imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus infections, including the Veladero, Pueblo Viejo and Porgera sites.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the divestment of African assets by AngloGold was a major factor behind the fall in the company’s output in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Read the full article here: <a href=\"https://digitalexploration.ai/gold-production-from-largest-miners-for-testing/\">https://digitalexploration.ai/gold-production-from-largest-miners-for-testing/</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/paqg5b/gold_production_from_the_eight_largest_miners_is/","title":"Gold production from the eight largest miners is expected to increase by up to 3.1% in 2021.","tags":["investing","reddit"],"date":"August 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-24T18:26:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-24 18:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"96b098fa-b82d-57a4-99cd-0aa326031248","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/paqg5b/gold_production_from_the_eight_largest_miners_is/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/paqg5b/gold_production_from_the_eight_largest_miners_is/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"investing","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing","author":"anushi45sahak","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/anushi45sahak","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"anushi45sahak","score":627,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"大手8社の金生産量は、2021年に最大で3.1%増加すると予想されています。","the_new_excerpt":"大規模鉱山会社8社の金生産量は、最大で1,000万トン増加する見込みです。\n2021年には最大で3.1%の増加が見込まれています。\n\nこれは、業界トップの金生産者が\n[https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/top-five-gold-mining-companies-world/] -\nNewmont、Barrick、AngloGold、Polyus、Kinross、Gold Fields、Newcrest...。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"2021年，八大矿商的黄金产量预计将最多增加3.1%。","the_new_excerpt":"八大矿商的黄金产量预计将增加达\n2021年的3.1%。\n\n这是在该行业的顶级黄金生产商\n[https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/top-five-gold-mining-companies-world/] -\n纽蒙特、巴里克、安格鲁黄金、波利斯、金罗斯、金田、纽克雷斯特...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"2021年，八大礦商的黃金產量預計將最多增加3.1%。","the_new_excerpt":"八大礦商的黃金產量預計將增加達\n2021年的3.1%。\n\n這是在該行業的頂級黃金生產商\n[https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/top-five-gold-mining-companies-world/] -\n紐蒙特、巴里克、安格魯黃金、波利斯、金羅斯、金田、紐克雷斯特...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-7aea34bd-dcc5-5f4d-93e5-3435e8a8fe8f","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pakxqq/mama_cathie_loss_porn/","title":"Mama Cathie loss porn","date":"August 24, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ママ・キャシー・ロス・ポルノ","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"妈妈凯西损失的色情","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"媽媽凱西損失的色情","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-75800467-e624-535c-8999-ec260288a1bb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/patkpy/gme_gang_is_back/","title":"GME GANG IS BACK","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 24, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"グミ・ギャング・イズ・バック","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"GME帮回来了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"GME幫回來了","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-96b098fa-b82d-57a4-99cd-0aa326031248","previousId":"RedditPost-7aea34bd-dcc5-5f4d-93e5-3435e8a8fe8f","nextId":"RedditPost-75800467-e624-535c-8999-ec260288a1bb","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/investing/comments/paqg5b/gold_production_from_the_eight_largest_miners_is/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
