Doesn&#39;t all the brand spanking new investors bode well for the long term?  My thought is: A lot of these people who got swept up in the GME YOLO wave and all that are not going to stick around, but there has to be a decent amount who have always been interested in stocks and didn&#39;t jump in before.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the latter who are sticking around to learn (I hope I am one of these) will eventually turn into knowledgeable traders who provide more money, new ideas or DD and better discussion right?</p>\n\n<p>Also, from what I understand of frozen concentrated orange juice, the market is brutal to the consistently foolish and emotional traders.  One the flip side of the coin will be people who can&#39;t handle it and get chewed up and spit out by everyone else.  I hope these kind of traders can get out without getting hurt too badly.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I wanted to hear from some folks on here on what they think about all of that.  Does having all these new users asking questions all the time beneficial in the long run or is it just the nuisance of newbies asking questions that can easily be looked up and who will quickly be gone?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lntqrx/flood_of_new_investors_thoughtdiscussion/","title":"Flood of new investors thought/discussion","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T05:33:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 05:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"9a6a2ab1-8b8f-5802-862d-0a080ecdd013","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lntqrx/flood_of_new_investors_thoughtdiscussion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lntqrx/flood_of_new_investors_thoughtdiscussion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"dafood00","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/dafood00","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"dafood00","score":52,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":null}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-917b300e-40a4-59db-9fff-f464cf2b7ea2","excerpt":"Hello.
