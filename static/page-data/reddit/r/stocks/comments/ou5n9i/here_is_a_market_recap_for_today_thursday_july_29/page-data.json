In my opinion, the fact that markets continue to shrug off volatility to charge higher shows great relative strength and signals that market participants remain willing and able to buy dips. </p>\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both recorded fresh all-time highs, closing 0.4% and 0.42% higher respectively. The Nasdaq (QQQ) is right under its own record high and closed the day 0.18% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed again, closing 0.77% higher.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:</strong> 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1</li>\n<li><strong>Personal consumption:</strong> 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1</li>\n<li><strong>Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:</strong> 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Market participants are digesting the Federal Reserve’s July Monetary Policy Report, released yesterday, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed’s stated goals. The statement read, “Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.” In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. </p>\n\n<p>On inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, “Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses” and “The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.”</p>\n\n<p>However, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if “appropriate risks arise”. The statement read, “In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee&#39;s goals. The Committee&#39;s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.”</p>\n\n<p>Read the entire July FOMC statement here: <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Amazon (AMZN) absolutely smashed earnings, posting probably the most impressive quarter I have ever seen. Despite this, the stock is currently down 5% after some analysts raised concerns about a slowdown in growth moving forward due to reopenings and difficult comparisons. Personally, with numbers like this, I am going to snap up any dip if it continues tomorrow. Here are the numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $115.06 billion expected versus $88.91 billion in Q2 2020</li>\n<li><strong>EPS:</strong> $15.75 expected versus $10.30 in Q2 2020</li>\n<li><strong>AWS revenue:</strong> $14.18 billion expected versus $10.81 billion in Q2 2020</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In other news, the Labor Department Weekly Unemployment Report came in higher than expected. Here are the numbers </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Jobless Claims:</strong> 400,000 vs 385,000 expected</li>\n<li><strong>Continuing Claims:</strong> 3.269 million vs 3.183 million expected</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yesterday, shares of Facebook (FB), which recently joined the $1 trillion market-cap club, fell after the company warned of a “significant slowdown” in growth moving forward and suggested that Apple’s (AAPL) newest iOS app-tracking update, which let’s users opt out of having apps track their activity outside their own platform, would negatively impact their core advertising business. Here are the numbers\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Earnings:</strong> $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected\\</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts</li>\n<li><strong>Daily active users (DAUs):</strong> 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly active users (MAUs):</strong> 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected</li>\n<li><strong>Average revenue per user (ARPU):</strong> $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>PayPal (PYPL) also reported earnings, which were largely in-line with expectations. As a result, stock fell roughly 5% today. Personally, that move seems a little overdone to me.</li>\n<li>Today was the highly anticipated IPO of Robinhood (HOOD), popular brokerage that has garnered a horrendous reputation among many retail traders, particularly those who invest in “meme stocks”. Like I have said before, personally not touching that stock with a 10-foot pole, too many dynamics at play. But it will still be fun to keep track of.</li>\n<li>President Biden on Thursday called for state and local governments to make $100 payments to every newly vaccinated American as authorities race to stem the newest wave of Covid-19 cases. </li>\n<li>Trevor Milton, founder and former CEO of Nikola Motors, the truck, hydrogen start-up that turned out to be a fraud, was charged with defrauding investors.</li>\n<li><strong>**Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices*\\</strong>*</li>\n<li>Align Technologies (ALGN) with two target raises.
