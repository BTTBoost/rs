This was based on historical and current data, stimulus news and where the charts sat, it was a good trade. </p>\n\n<p>The week goes through, we break 305, so I exit and replace the trade -$400 loss for a 300 close. Which is fine as the gains will be $800.</p>\n\n<p>My dumb ass decides to sit and watch the market and not walk away for a few hours. QQQ breaks 300, 299, 298. I didn’t like it. It came back to 301 and I sold out at a -700 loss. </p>\n\n<p>Qqq finished the day at 308. </p>\n\n<p>My original plan, backtested, proved that this is successful 98% of the time. Guess what, it would have been successful and a clean $500 gain. Now I’m sat on an $1100 loss because I didn’t grip myself and trade the plan. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the funds this freed up enabled me to buy a tonne of HEXO, NIO, ENVB, and ANTX, some with options which are now ITM. It’s a shame but here we are. </p>\n\n<p>Trade the plan, have patience.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/lz2g1b/always_trade_the_plan_patience_prevails_and/","title":"Always trade the plan.
