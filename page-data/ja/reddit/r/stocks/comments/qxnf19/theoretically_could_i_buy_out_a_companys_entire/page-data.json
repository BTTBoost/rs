I don’t know if this is possible but I just want to know what would happen. Let’s take a company with a very small market cap. $WORX has a market cap of 16M at the moment. Could a retail trader buy out half or even an entire float on a broker like robinhood? I know putting a huge buy order would inflate the price dramatically but let’s say it stays around this range for the next 30 days. </p>\n\n<p>To keep the price action stable, I buy 10K-50K shares per order. I do this every few hours. I have about $10M of fake money in my account. I do this in stealth mode for the next 30 days till I own more than 70% of the float. Current free float is over 8M.</p>\n\n<p>1) Would this cause it to skyrocket way before the 30 day mark? \n2) Is this illegal? \n3) Would I have to file 13D or would my broker automatically file it for me and put it under the company’s newsfeed? \n4) Would management find out immediately and can they just dilute me even though I’m technically a majority shareholder?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qxnf19/theoretically_could_i_buy_out_a_companys_entire/","title":"Theoretically, Could I buy out a company’s entire free float?","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"November 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-20T01:10:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-20 01:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qxnf19","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qxnf19/theoretically_could_i_buy_out_a_companys_entire/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qxnf19/theoretically_could_i_buy_out_a_companys_entire/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"Seatt50kd","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Seatt50kd","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Seatt50kd","score":157,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"理論的には、その会社の浮動株をすべて買い取ることができるのでしょうか？","the_new_excerpt":"くだらない質問かもしれませんが、よろしくお願いします。可能かどうかはわかりませんが、私はただ\n何が起こるのかを知りたいのです。例えば、時価総額が非常に小さい会社を考えてみましょう。\nキャップの会社を考えてみましょう。$WORXの時価総額は、現時点で16Mです。リテール・トレーダーが\nロビンフッドのようなブローカーで浮動株の半分、あるいは全体を買い取ることができますか？I...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"理论上，我可以买下一家公司的全部自由流通股吗？","the_new_excerpt":"这可能是一个愚蠢的问题。我不知道这是否可能，但我只是\n想知道会发生什么。让我们来看看一个市值很小的公司\n的公司。$WORX目前的市值为1600万。一个散户能否买断\n一半，甚至是整个浮动，像Robinhood这样的经纪人？I...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"理論上，我可以買下一家公司的全部自由流通股嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"這可能是一個愚蠢的問題。我不知道這是否可能，但我只是\n想知道會發生什麼。讓我們來看看一個市值很小的公司\n的公司。$WORX目前的市值爲1600萬。一個散戶能否買斷\n一半，甚至是整個浮動，像Robinhood這樣的經紀人？I...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"TweetPost-1461811842188296200","excerpt":"","slug":"/tweet/1461811842188296200","title":"The 5th major wave of covid-19 in the US has begun... https://t.co/0buCAhNvGW","date":"November 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Twitter","parent":{"localize":[{"locale":"ja","full_text":"米国でのコヴィド19の第5次大きな波が始まった... https://t.co/0buCAhNvGW","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh","full_text":"美国第五次大的covid-19浪潮已经开始... https://t.co/0buCAhNvGW","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null},{"locale":"zh-Hant","full_text":"美國第五次大的covid-19浪潮已經開始... https://t.co/0buCAhNvGW","quoted_status_full_text":null,"retweeted_status_full_text":null}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qxslp4","excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/ford-and-rivian-cancel-plans-to-jointly-develop-an-electric-vehicle.html\n\nBased on this latest news, Couple of points which came to my mind\n\n1 ) Was this intentionally done by Ford, They invested $500M in Rivian, then\nRivian IPOed, Stock p[rice was pumped up and now…","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qxslp4/rivian_drops_ford_partnership/","title":"Rivian drops Ford Partnership","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"November 20, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"リビアンがフォードとのパートナーシップを解消","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/ford-and-rivian-cancel-plans-to-jointly-develop-an-electric-vehicle.html\n\n今回のニュースを受けて、いくつかの点が頭に浮かびました。\n\n1 ) これはフォードが意図的に行ったことなのでしょうか？彼らはRivianに5億ドルを投資しました。\nRivianがIPOし、株価が上昇し、そして今・・・。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"里维安放弃了福特合作关系","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/ford-and-rivian-cancel-plans-to-jointly-develop-an-electric-vehicle.html\n\n根据这一最新消息，我想到了几个问题\n\n1 ) 这是不是福特公司有意为之，他们在Rivian投资了5亿美元，然后\nRivian公司上市，股票价格被拉高，现在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"裏維安放棄了福特合作關係","the_new_excerpt":"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/ford-and-rivian-cancel-plans-to-jointly-develop-an-electric-vehicle.html\n\n根據這一最新消息，我想到了幾個問題\n\n1 ) 這是不是福特公司有意爲之，他們在Rivian投資了5億美元，然後\nRivian公司上市，股票價格被拉高，現在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-qxnf19","previousId":"TweetPost-1461811842188296200","nextId":"RedditPost-qxslp4","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/qxnf19/theoretically_could_i_buy_out_a_companys_entire/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
