I’ve had a lot of health problems after breaking my neck in 2005 including two blood infections, over 30 surgeries, and having both hips amputated. I just didn’t see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore after all the years of pain. I heard about GME going crazy and said what the hell and bought in at $330 (currently 5.8 shares @ $171.73)with the little savings I had and ever since that moment I’ve found a purpose in life. I have goals for the first time in ten years. My biggest one is to be off disability by the end of the year so I can better help my dad who has taken care of me after my car accident. Getting up in the morning is a little easier and the days seem a little brighter now. Thank you for being such a cool community.  &lt;3</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5mc4h/wsb_saved_me/","title":"WSB saved me.","tags":["wallstreetbets","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T17:42:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 17:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"d3a78083-674c-5750-bce8-5c8ce73301d3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5mc4h/wsb_saved_me/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5mc4h/wsb_saved_me/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"wallstreetbets","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets","author":"AdhesivenessWorth118","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdhesivenessWorth118","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"AdhesivenessWorth118","score":5340,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"WSB救了我","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，你们这些奇妙的猿人。我想说谢谢你们救了我。我已经放弃了\n今年年初，准备去天上的大丛林。我已经有了一个\n2005年，我的脖子断了之后，身体出现了很多问题，包括两次流血。\n感染，超过30次手术， 并有两个髋关节截肢。I…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"WSB救了我","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，你們這些奇妙的猿人。我想說謝謝你們救了我。我已經放棄了\n今年年初，準備去天上的大叢林。我已經有了一個\n2005年，我的脖子斷了之後，身體出現了很多問題，包括兩次流血。\n感染，超過30次手術， 並有兩個髖關節截肢。I…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-f5056827-9341-5d53-bf50-6c3346b629dc","excerpt":"I invested in Blackberry a few months ago with the rumours of the deal with\namazon.
