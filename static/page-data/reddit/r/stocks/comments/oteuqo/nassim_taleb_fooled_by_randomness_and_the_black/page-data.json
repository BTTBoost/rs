Most traders were just picking up pennies in front of a steamroller</li>\n<li>  2 types of randomness analogy\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mediocristan – land of average</li>\n<li>Extremistan – land of black swans</li>\n<li>Mediocristan - When your sample is large; no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but insignificant to the sum. IE – Human weights, Human heights, car accidents, IQ\n\n<ul>\n<li>Black swans don&#39;t occur here. Once you collect enough data should reveal all you need to know and if you do have a surprise, it won&#39;t be consequential. Collecting data here is ok. What you can learn from data in Mediocristan augments very rapidly with the supply of information. You can predict here.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Extemistan – inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate or the total. IE – wealth, income, book sales per author, financial markets, commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data\n\n<ul>\n<li>Black swans do occur here. You will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. Be suspicious of the knowledge of the data you collect here. Knowledge here grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data. Difficult or even impossible to predict.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>  Black Swan Example – Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird&#39;s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly humans &quot;looking out for my best interests&quot;. But the Wednesday before Thanksgiving something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will occur a revision of belief. Ironically, the turkeys feeling of safety had reached a maximum when the risk was the highest.\n\n<ul>\n<li>The turkey had &quot;learned backwards&quot; from observation</li>\n<li>oHow can we know the future, given finite knowledge of the past?</li>\n<li>Something may have worked in the past until, well it doesn&#39;t. You don&#39;t drive your car looking in the rear-view mirror.</li>\n<li>Before 1987, the biggest single day drop in the Dow was 13% so some people incorrectly concluded from the past that they most the Dow could drop in a day was 13%. It dropped 22% on &quot;Black Monday&quot;</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>  Positive Black Swans take time to show their effects while negative black swans happen very quickly</li>\n<li>  Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence</li>\n<li>  Naïve Empiricism – We tend to have a tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world and these instances are easy to find. You take past instances that corroborate your theories and treat them as evidence.</li>\n<li>  Negative Empiricism - The way to counter your Naïve Empiricism is to understand that a series of corroborative facts is not <em>Necessarily</em> evidence. Seeing White Swans does not confirm the nonexistence of Black Swans.</li>\n<li>  The error of confirmation - We are quick to draw conclusions from what we have seen to what is unseen.</li>\n<li>  Confirmation Bias – our natural tendency to look only for corroboration of our ideas.\n\n<ul>\n<li>To counter this George Soros was known when taking a financial bet to keep looking for evidence or instances to prove his initial theory wrong</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>  Narrative Fallacy – this is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world, especially rare events\n\n<ul>\n<li>We tend to look at sequences of facts and weave them into an explanation. Explanations bind these facts together. Making them easy to remember. They help us make more sense of the facts. Because our brains can&#39;t store all that information. Stories stick, statistics don&#39;t</li>\n<li>The more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. The same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>  In some strategies, you gamble dollars to win a succession of pennies while appearing to be winning all the time. In other strategies, you risk a succession of pennies to win dollars. In other words, you bet either that the black swan will or won&#39;t happen. These require completely different mind sets.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most people have a preference for number 1</li>\n<li>Some bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>  We favor the narrated. We are not manufactured to understand abstract matters, we need context. Randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. We respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened.</li>\n<li>  Our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds. When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions. So those who delay developing their theories are better off</li>\n<li>  We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our success to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good, but not for the bad.</li>\n<li>  Taleb&#39;s Perfect World – &quot;Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; He does not mind looking like a fool. He hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. He introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and mental exhaustion. This does not mean he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect.</li>\n<li>  Louis Pasteur – &quot;Luck favors the prepared&quot;</li>\n<li>  The black swan asymmetry allows you to be confident about what is wrong, not about what you believe is right</li>\n<li>  So, what to do if you can&#39;t predict in a world with Black Swans??\n\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid unnecessary dependence on large scale harmful predictions. Be fooled in small matters, not large. Example – don&#39;t accept the government forecast for SS payments 50 years from now.</li>\n<li>Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictions</li>\n<li>Be prepared! Be prepared for all relevant eventualities</li>\n<li>People are often ashamed of losses, so they engage in strategies that produce very little volatility but contain the risk of large loss.</li>\n<li>Barbell Strategy</li>\n<li>Be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive and you can instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative</li>\n<li>Put 80-90% in extremely safe investments – (Example – T-Bills)</li>\n<li>Put the other 10-20% in extremely speculative investments (Example – VC)</li>\n<li>You have no risk on one side and high risk on the other, which equals out to medium risk. This minimizes your risk of negative black swans and exposures you to positive black swans</li>\n<li>Put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones</li>\n<li>I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/stocks/comments/oteuqo/nassim_taleb_fooled_by_randomness_and_the_black/","title":"Nassim Taleb Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan book summary","tags":["stocks","reddit"],"date":"July 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-07-28T20:52:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-07-28 20:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"52c0445b-eb00-504a-b6d8-6fa5affa7b14","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oteuqo/nassim_taleb_fooled_by_randomness_and_the_black/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oteuqo/nassim_taleb_fooled_by_randomness_and_the_black/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"stocks","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks","author":"captmorgan50","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/captmorgan50","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"captmorgan50","score":196,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Nassim Taleb Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan ブックサマリー","the_new_excerpt":"ナッシム・タレブ\n\n\nランダム性に騙される\n\n * サバイバーシップ・バイアスとは、あるトピックについて敗者の声を聞かず、勝者の声だけを聞くことです。\n   勝者からしか聞かない。\n   * 結果で人を判断してはいけない、なぜなら歴史は勝者だけを示すからだ。\n     結果で人を判断してはいけない。負けた人の話は聞きません。\n * Over short...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"纳西姆-塔勒布《被随机性愚弄》和《黑天鹅》一书摘要","the_new_excerpt":"纳西姆-塔勒布\n\n\n被随机性所愚弄\n\n * 幸存者偏差意味着你不会听到一个话题中的失败者，你只会听到\n   你只听到赢家的声音。\n   * 注意根据一个人的结果来判断他，因为历史只会让你看到赢家。\n     赢家。你不会听到失败者的故事。\n *过短...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"納西姆-塔勒布《被隨機性愚弄》和《黑天鵝》一書摘要","the_new_excerpt":"納西姆-塔勒布\n\n\n被隨機性所愚弄\n\n * 倖存者偏差意味着你不會聽到一個話題中的失敗者，你只會聽到\n   你只聽到贏家的聲音。\n   * 注意根據一個人的結果來判斷他，因爲歷史只會讓你看到贏家。\n     贏家。你不會聽到失敗者的故事。\n *過短...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-24c7a1d8-b040-5d46-9d6c-d8f223140ab5","excerpt":"Have 80k in my TFSA would like to buy a house in the next 1-3years and have a\nsolid downpayment\n\nMy portfolio is 90/10 stocks/bonds which obviously is not a good idea with a 3\nyear horizon..\n\nWhat allocation should I go with? 10/90?\n\nHey I’m cool with 1-4% if possible!","slug":"/reddit/r/Bogleheads/comments/oswb8f/super_low_risk_14_possible/","title":"Super low risk 1-4% possible?","date":"July 28, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"超低リスクの1～4％が可能？","the_new_excerpt":"TFSAには8万ドルあり、今後1～3年のうちに家を買いたいと考えています。\nしっかりとした頭金が必要です。\n\n私のポートフォリオは株と債券が90/10で、明らかに3年のホライゾンでは良いアイデアではありません。\nこれは明らかに3年後の水平線では良いアイデアではありませんが...。\n\nどのような配分にすべきでしょうか？10/90?\n\nできれば1～4％がいいですね。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"超低风险1-4%的可能性？","the_new_excerpt":"我的TFSA里有8万块钱，想在未来1-3年内买一套房子，并有一笔坚实的首付。\n坚实的首付款\n\n我的投资组合是90/10的股票/债券，这显然不是一个好主意，因为我有3个孩子。\n年的视野，这显然不是一个好主意。\n\n我应该如何分配？10/90?\n\n嘿，如果可能的话，我对1-4%的投资很感兴趣。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"超低風險1-4%的可能性？","the_new_excerpt":"我的TFSA裏有8萬塊錢，想在未來1-3年內買一套房子，並有一筆堅實的首付。\n堅實的首付款\n\n我的投資組合是90/10的股票/債券，這顯然不是一個好主意，因爲我有3個孩子。\n年的視野，這顯然不是一個好主意。\n\n我應該如何分配？10/90?\n\n嘿，如果可能的話，我對1-4%的投資很感興趣。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-90b9f33e-c241-5860-a810-faa343168f4c","excerpt":"Hi I started my ROTH IRA using the 3 fund portfolio at the end of 2019.
